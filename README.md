*Textual analyses of U.S. political discourse using NLP, LLM-assisted workflows, and graph visualizations.*

One of my ongoing hyperfixations of 2025 is exploring trends/people/keywords in US politics. My primary dataset is:

**[POTUS Presidential Actions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhZPyUYXrsAF5z6kTfYSFieFw1R6JO1cmkVFakNu-uk/edit?usp=sharing)**
- A representative sample of ‚ÄòPresidential Actions‚Äô lifted from [whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
- Sample size **n=176**, (46% of total corpus) was selected to balance analytical depth with processing constraints. Contains "proclamations", "executive orders", & "memoranda" (timeframe ranges from February 2025 - September 2025)
- Web-scraped text of each ‚ÄòPresidential Action‚Äô
- Some metadata
> **Constraints & limitations** are addressed in more detail within the *Spreadsheet [README](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhZPyUYXrsAF5z6kTfYSFieFw1R6JO1cmkVFakNu-uk/edit?gid=1190618694#gid=1190618694&range=A1) *.

# Exploratory analyses of POTUS Presidential Actions
I assembled these data to test various hypotheses and assumptions I had about US politics. My intentions are to use **quantitative textual analyses, NLP, LLMs & data visualization techniques** to 
1. interrogate the validity of my hypotheses and assumptions
2. discover trends or relationships I did not anticipate

> # Hypotheses
> > **While I begin with these specific hypotheses, the *Weird Guys Project* remains fundamentally exploratory. I am interested in discovering unexpected patterns and relationships that challenge my initial assumptions.**
> > - The keywords analyzed in this initial exploration were manually selected based on my my domain knowledge and research hypotheses. *This approach risks confirmation bias and may miss significant themes* outside my predetermined focus.
> > - To reduce selection bias and draw stronger conclusions, future iterations should utilize automated NLP techniques, topic modeling, or clustering algorithms to identify statistically significant keyword patterns without prior assumptions.
> > - Dataset only includes a sample of the **DJT's second term as POTUS, 2025**. It may be have been useful to compare with (a) their previous term, and (b) other Presidents.
>
> 
> ## My hypotheses:
> 1. **Linguistic Framing of Social Groups:** The language used in Presidential Actions will show distinct, measurable patterns when discussing topics related to **reproductive rights, gender-nonconforming individuals**, and **immigration**. I hypothesize this language may align with frameworks of restriction or opposition more frequently than with frameworks of support or inclusion.
> 2. **Strategic Focus on the Judiciary:** There will be a significant emphasis on the **judicial branch** (e.g., frequent mentions of judges, courts, rulings). I hypothesize that this is a strategic channel through which policy preferences on the issues above are articulated or anticipated.
> 3. **Networked Keyword Relationships:** I expect to see a strong co-occurrence network between **judicial keywords** and keywords related to **reproductive rights, gender identity, and immigration.** This would visually illustrate the hypothesized strategic link between the judiciary and these policy areas.

Over time, my methods and visualizations are subject to change, and the dataset is subject to grow, but  steps were to
1. [Count](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhZPyUYXrsAF5z6kTfYSFieFw1R6JO1cmkVFakNu-uk/edit?gid=95626583#gid=95626583&range=A1) words
2. [graph](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/ngv-FD0AbXM) words
3. select keywords & themes I believed to be significant

Nothing particularly interesting...


## Data Ingestion Process
Over several months, I extracted and categorized ‚ÄòPresidential Actions‚Äô from the official Whitehouse website
- Manually selected samples
- Automatically extracted full website text with a [Google Apps Script (GAS) web scraping script](apps-script/full_text.js).

<details>
  <summary>Click for summary of the Apps Script functions...</summary>
  <p><b> GAS web scraping functions:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Get the active spreadsheet‚Äôs <em>active sheet</em> for data and the <em>logs</em> sheet for logging.</li>
  <li>Read the header row (row 1) to find the column indexes for <code>url</code>, <code>full_text</code>, and <code>char_count</code>.</li>
  <li>If any of those headers are missing, create them in row 1 (so each column exists).</li>
  <li>Determine the last data row, then read all URLs (from the <code>url</code> column) and any existing text (from the <code>full_text</code> column) starting at row 2.</li>
  <li>For each row:
    <ul>
      <li>If the URL cell is empty, skip the row.</li>
      <li>If <code>full_text</code> already has content, skip and add a ‚ÄúSkipped (Already processed)‚Äù log entry.</li>
      <li>Otherwise:
        <ul>
          <li>Fetch the page HTML at the URL (HTTP errors won‚Äôt throw due to <code>muteHttpExceptions: true</code>).</li>
          <li>Clean the HTML by removing <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> blocks, stripping all tags, and collapsing whitespace.</li>
          <li>Truncate the cleaned text to 50,000 characters and compute its length.</li>
          <li>Write the truncated text to the row‚Äôs <code>full_text</code> cell and the length to <code>char_count</code>.</li>
          <li>Queue a log entry noting the row number and character count.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If any error occurs during fetch/processing, queue a log entry with the error message and row number.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After processing all rows, append all queued log entries (timestamp + message) to the <em>logs</em> sheet.</li>
</ul>

 ## Initial exploration
 <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhZPyUYXrsAF5z6kTfYSFieFw1R6JO1cmkVFakNu-uk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="Click to explore POTUS Presidential Actions">
<img src="images/exploratory_keywords.png" alt="POTUS Presidential Actions Dataset" />
</a>

 I used fragile, shameful, and forbidden techniques to quickly search each article for keywords, and output Boolean TRUE/FALSE values. 
```
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(AF2:AF<>"", IF(REGEXMATCH(AF2:AF, G1), TRUE, FALSE), ""))
```
Similar *keywords and synonyms* were included in the Boolean search with pipes, e.g.
- gay|lesbian|transgender|intersex
- radical|extremist|extremism

## Incorporating LLMs
I used GPT-5 to (1) transform my spreadsheet data into graph data, (2) export these data as a **.GEXF file**. ChatGPT‚Äôs first attempt showed promise, but wasn‚Äôt particularly noteworthy, useful or legible. 
Techniclly, data was visualised - but no story; a bird's nest full of weird confusing eggs.

## Prompt given to GPT-5:

```
I want to visualize the data in "POTUS Presidential Actions" from the attached Google Sheets document. 
This spreadsheet is a database of articles.

- Columns G:AE tracks keywords, with Boolean values ["TRUE", "FALSE"] denoting if a given row mentions a given keyword. 
- I want an interactive force-directed network graph to visualize the relationship various keywords have.
```

# Incorporating Gephi
Happy that GPT-5 could structure CSV files as graph data, I asked it to export the data as a **.GEXF** file.

> ## Key Data Components
> A GEXF file primarily stores the components of a graph or network:
> - **Nodes (Vertices):** The individual entities within the network (e.g., people, websites, genes).
> - **Edges (Links):** The connections between the nodes, representing relationships (e.g., friendships, hyperlinks, interactions). Edges can be **directed** (A links to B) or **undirected** (A and B are related).

I am still learning to work with graph visualizations, but I am seeing the potential to find stories that emerge from the data. 
- Keyword size denotes frequency within dataset
- Green lines connect words that are found in the same ‚ÄòPresidential Action‚Äô
- Line thickness denotes frequency that connected words appear together

  ![screenshot of 'potus_keywords_network.gexf'](images/potus_keywords_network_gexf.png)
  > My first visualization gives me hope that my methodology is plausibly capturing encoded meaning. It appears to show patterns predicted in the hypothesis
  > - the edge weights demonstrate a relationship with **judicial keywords** and keywords related to **reproductive rights, gender identity,** and **immigration**, with significant focus on **children & infants**.

[![POTUS walks like a duck, and talks like a duck. The pattern displays characteristics consistent with ducks, but requires further validation to rule out methodological artifacts or coincidence.](images/LGBTQ_unsavory_neighbours.png)](https://youtu.be/JJyQC4RQgHI)
> **LGBTQ-coded** keywords were neighbours with keywords such as "**enemy**", "**extremism**", and "**terror**".

# An Unexpected Finding?

## **Artificial Intelligence** keyword clusters appear to show high centrality
- The strength of these connections is visually prominent
- It is possible the high centrality & high frequency is a result of flaws in my method of capturing keywords
   - maint**AI**n
   - bu**LLM**astiff
- AI, LLMs, and Artificial Intelligence are extremely hot stories in the news cycle right now, and my web scraper is pretty dumb; it may be pulling text from the related/trending articles section.


## **Open Questions:**
- Are these patterns statistically significant, or an artifact of my methodology?
- Does it represent a meaningful relationship in the data, or random clustering?
- Would more robust methodology and larger datasets increase or decrease the strength of these patterns?

# Drilling Down, Findings and Conclusions
I created an interactive chord diagram to visually explore themes. Each theme has multiple keywords. Click on a chord to explore its relationship.

## Methodology

### Metrics Framework

The analysis (explorable in the interactive chart above) employs three complementary metrics to understand the relationship networks:

#### **Records (Shared Records)**
- **Definition:** Number of documents that mention both items (themes or keywords)
- **Purpose:** Identifies the backbone of the network (e.g., border‚Üîsecurity, judicial_legal‚Üîsocial_justice_diversity)
- **Value:** Surfaces high-traffic connections worth investigating first

#### **Jaccard Overlap**
- **Formula:** `|A‚à©B| / |A‚à™B|`
- **Purpose:** Penalizes very common items that appear everywhere
- **Value:** Prevents frequency bias, confirms balanced co-presence beyond simple popularity

#### **NPMI (Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information)**
- **Range:** ‚àí1 to 1
- **Purpose:** Measures specificity of co-occurrence
- **Value:** Reveals coherent bundles that move together, even if smaller in volume

### Analytical Approach

**Together, these metrics provide:**
- **Records:** Structural foundation
- **Jaccard:** Frequency bias prevention  
- **NPMI:** Specific narrative coupling identification

### Theme-Keyword Assignment Strategy

**Why group keywords into themes?**

1. **Compression & Clarity:** Reduces token sparsity, creates interpretable nodes
2. **Multi-scale Analysis:** Broad theme-level overview with keyword-level detail
3. **Noise Control:** Themes stabilize metrics while preserving keyword-level signals
4. **Future Fidelity:** Enables sub-typing (e.g., border-security vs energy-security)

## Key Findings

### H1: Linguistic Framing of Social Groups

**Hypothesis:** Mentions of reproductive rights, gender-nonconforming people, and immigration skew restrictive/oppositional rather than supportive/inclusive.

#### Evidence

**Tight Cultural Bundle (NPMI Leaders):**
```
gender/sex ‚Üî biology/science ‚Üî children/family ‚Üî religion/faith ‚Üî extremism/radicalism
```
*Indicates biological essentialism + child-protection + moralized threat rhetoric*

**Immigration as Security/Military:**
- Border security pairs with invasion/military framing and international relations
- Border‚Üîsecurity represents a top Records edge

**DEI in Contested Settings:**
- Strong within-DEI connections (diversity‚Üîinclusion)
- Frequently co-mentioned with judicial/security themes

#### Illustrative Examples

> **"DEFENDING WOMEN FROM GENDER IDEOLOGY EXTREMISM AND RESTORING BIOLOGICAL TRUTH..."**  
> *Gender/biological co-presence demonstrating biological essentialism frame*  
> Source: [White House Presidential Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/)

> **"PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST INVASION"**  
> *Immigration framed as national security/military problem*  
> Source: [White House Presidential Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/)

#### Conclusion
**‚úÖ SUPPORTED** - Gender passages consistently pair with biological essentialism, child-protection, and religion/extremism cues. Immigration is systematically securitized and militarized.

---

### H2: Strategic Focus on the Judiciary

**Hypothesis:** Judicial language serves as a significant channel for articulating and anticipating policy.

#### Evidence

**Courts as Network Bridge:**
- Judicial_legal co-occurs strongly with security/border and DEI/culture themes
- Acts as connector across different policy blocks

**Legal Mechanisms in Security/Foreign Contexts:**
- Judicial tokens frequently appear with security/border language
- Sanctions/designations/enforcement patterns recur

#### Illustrative Examples

> **"prioritize Title IX enforcement..."**  
> *Gender policy implementation via legal mechanisms*  
> Source: [White House Presidential Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/)

> **"Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)"**  
> *Direct case citation within gender policy text*  
> Source: [White House Presidential Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/)

#### Conclusion
**‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY SUPPORTED** - Courts function as reliable bridges and operational pathways, though security and DEI themes show higher volume concentration.

---

### H3: Networked Keyword Relationships

**Hypothesis:** Judicial keywords strongly co-occur with reproductive, gender, and immigration keywords.

#### Evidence

**Theme-Level Connections:**
- Judicial_legal consistently links to DEI/culture and security/border (high Records, solid Jaccard)

**Keyword-Level Results:**
- Mixed findings: judicial tokens pair heavily with security/border words
- Tightest NPMI bundles remain cultural (gender/biology/children/religion/extremism)
- Court terms don't always appear in the same window

#### Illustrative Examples

> **Judicial + Immigration/Security Context:**  
> "...procedural requirements to conform with existing law... Immigration and Nationality Act..."  
> Source: [White House Presidential Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/)

#### Conclusion
**‚û°Ô∏è DIRECTIONALLY SUPPORTED** - Strong connections at theme scale, mixed results at strict keyword granularity except in security/foreign-anchored passages.

## Special Observations

### Children/Family Framing
**"Children/family"** frequently serves as a bridge term connecting:
- Gender/sex themes
- Religion/faith contexts  
- Biological terminology
- Extremism/radicalism rhetoric

This pattern suggests a protective/moral register used to justify restrictive policies.

### Immigration & Geographic References
- **Southern Border Focus:** Mexico/Central/South America mentions co-locate with border/security and invasion/military framing
- **Foreign Relations Context:** China/Iran/Russia/Israel tied to international relations/sanctions, with judicial mechanisms as enforcement tools rather than cultural frames
