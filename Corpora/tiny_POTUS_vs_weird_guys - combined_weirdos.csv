What? I mean, am I crazy or something? First of all, you can’t just build an ideology. They’re handed down across the centuries, like lasagna recipes. They need to age, like bourbon. You can’t just drink it straight out of the radiator. And look what happens if you try. What causes all the problems of the world? Ideology, that’s what. What do Bush and Osama have in common? They’re both ideological nutcases. We’re supposed to need more of this? Furthermore, it’s simply not possible to build a new ideology. People have been talking about ideology since Jesus was a little boy. At least! And I’m supposedly going to improve on this? Some random person on the Internet, who flunked out of grad school, who doesn’t know Greek or Latin? Who do I think I am, Wallace Shawn ? All excellent objections. Let’s answer them and then we’ll talk about formalism. First, of course, there are a couple of beautifully aged traditional ideologies which the Internet now brings us in glorious detail. They go by lots of names, but let’s call them progressivism and conservatism . My beef with progressivism is that for at least the last 100 years, the vast majority of writers and thinkers and smart people in general have been progressives. Therefore, any intellectual in 2007, which unless there has been some kind of Internet space warp and my words are being carried live on Fox News, is anyone reading this, is basically marinated in progressive ideology. Perhaps this might slightly impair one’s ability to see any problems that may exist in the progressive worldview. As for conservatism, not all Muslims are terrorists, but most terrorists are Muslims. Similarly, not all conservatives are cretins, but most cretins are conservatives. The modern American conservative movement—which is paradoxically much younger than the progressive movement, if only because it had to be reinvented after the Roosevelt dictatorship—has been distinctly affected by this audience. It also suffers from the electoral coincidence that it has to despise everything that progressivism adores, a bizarre birth defect which does not appear to be treatable. Most people who don’t consider themselves “progressives” or “conservatives” are one of two things. Either they’re “moderates,” or they’re “libertarians.” In my experience, most sensible people consider themselves “moderate,” “centrist,” “independent,” “unideological,” “pragmatic,” “apolitical,” etc. Considering the vast tragedies wrought by 20th-century politics, this attitude is quite understandable. It is also, in my opinion, responsible for most of the death and destruction in the world today. Moderation is not an ideology. It is not an opinion. It is not a thought. It is an absence of thought. If you believe the status quo of 2007 is basically righteous, then you should believe the same thing if a time machine transported you to Vienna in 1907. But if you went around Vienna in 1907 saying that there should be a European Union, that Africans and Arabs should rule their own countries and even colonize Europe, that any form of government except parliamentary democracy is evil, that paper money is good for business, that all doctors should work for the State, etc., etc.—well, you could probably find people who agreed with you. They wouldn’t call themselves “moderates,” and nor would anyone else. No, if you were a moderate in Vienna in 1907, you thought Franz Josef I was the greatest thing since sliced bread. So which is it? Hapsburgs, or Eurocrats? Pretty hard to split the difference on that one. In other words, the problem with moderation is that the “center” is not fixed. It moves. And since it moves, and people being people, people will try to move it. This creates an incentive for violence—something we formalists try to avoid. More on this in a bit. That leaves libertarians. Now, I love libertarians to death. My CPU practically has a permanent open socket to the Mises Institute . In my opinion, anyone who has intentionally chosen to remain ignorant of libertarian (and, in particular, Misesian – Rothbardian ) thought, in an era when a couple of mouse clicks will feed you enough high-test libertarianism to drown a moose, is not an intellectually serious person. Furthermore, I am a computer programmer who has read far too much science fiction—two major risk factors for libertarianism. So I could just say, “ read Rothbard ,” and call it a day. On the other hand, it is hard to avoid noticing two basic facts about the universe. One is that libertarianism is an extremely obvious idea. The other is that it has never been successfully implemented. This does not prove anything. But what it suggests is that libertarianism is, as its detractors are always quick to claim, an essentially impractical ideology. I would love to live in a libertarian society. The question is: is there a path from here to there? And if we get there, will we stay there? If your answer to both questions is obviously “yes,” perhaps your definition of “obvious” is not the same as mine. So this is why I decided to build my own ideology—“formalism.” Of course, there is nothing new in formalism. Progressives, conservatives, moderates, and libertarians will all recognize large chunks of their own undigested realities. Even the word “formalism” is borrowed from legal formalism , which is basically the same idea in more modest attire. I am not Vizzini . I am just some dude who buys a lot of obscure used books, and is not afraid to grind them down, add flavor, and rebrand the result as a kind of political surimi . Most everything I have to say is available, with better writing, more detail and much more erudition, in Jouvenel , Kuehnelt-Leddihn , Leoni , Burnham , Nock , etc., etc. If you’ve never heard of any of these people, neither had I until I started the procedure. If that scares you, it should. Replacing your own ideology is a lot like do-it-yourself brain surgery. It requires patience, tolerance, a high pain threshold, and very steady hands. Whoever you are, you already have an ideology in there, and if it wanted to come out it would have done so on its own. There is no point in starting this messy experiment only to install some other ideology that’s the way it is just because someone said so. Formalism, as we’ll see, is an ideology designed by geeks for other geeks. It’s not a kit. It doesn’t come with batteries. You can’t just pop it in. At best, it’s a rough starting point to help you build your own DIY ideology. If you’re not comfortable working with a table saw, an oscilloscope and an autoclave, formalism is not for you. That said: The basic idea of formalism is just that the main problem in human affairs is violence. The goal is to design a way for humans to interact, on a planet of remarkably limited size, without violence. Especially organized violence. Next to organized human-on-human violence, a good formalist believes, all other problems—Poverty, Global Warming, Moral Decay, etc., etc., etc.—are basically insignificant. Perhaps once we get rid of violence we can worry a little about Moral Decay, but given that organized violence killed a couple of hundred million people in the last century, whereas Moral Decay gave us “American Idol,” I think the priorities are pretty clear. The key is to look at this not as a moral problem, but as an engineering problem. Any solution that solves the problem is acceptable. Any solution that does not solve the problem is not acceptable. For example, there is an existing idea called pacifism , part of the general progressive suite, which claims to be a solution for violence. As I understand it, the idea of pacifism is that if you and I can not be violent, everyone else will not be violent, too. There’s no doubt in my mind that pacifism is effective in some cases. In Northern Ireland, for example, it seems to be just the thing. But there is a kind of “ hundredth-monkey ” logic to it that consistently eludes my linear, Western mind. It strikes me that if everyone is a pacifist and then one person decides not to be a pacifist, he will wind up ruling the world. Hm. A further difficulty is that the definition of “violence” isn’t so obvious. If I gently relieve you of your wallet, and you chase after me with your Glock and make me beg to be allowed to give it back, which of us is being violent? Suppose I say, well, it was your wallet—but it’s my wallet now? This suggests, at the very least, that we need a rule that tells us whose wallet is whose. Violence, then, is anything that breaks the rule, or replaces it with a different rule. If the rule is clear and everyone follows it, there is no violence. In other words, violence equals conflict plus uncertainty . While there are wallets in the world, conflict will exist. But if we can eliminate uncertainty—if there is an unambiguous, unbreakable rule that tells us, in advance, who gets the wallet—I have no reason to sneak my hand into your pocket, and you have no reason to run after me shooting wildly into the air. Neither of our actions, by definition, can affect the outcome of the conflict. Violence of any size makes no sense without uncertainty. Consider a war. If one army knows it will lose the war, perhaps on the advice of some infallible oracle, it has no reason to fight. Why not surrender and get it over with? But this has only multiplied our difficulties. Where do all these rules come from? Who makes them unbreakable? Who gets to be the oracle? Why is the wallet “yours,” rather than “mine”? What happens if we disagree on this? If there’s one rule for every wallet, how can everyone remember them all? And suppose it’s not you, but me, who’s got the Glock? Fortunately, great philosophers have spent many long hours pondering these details. The answers I give you are theirs, not mine. First, one sensible way to make rules is that you’re bound by a rule if, and only if, you agree to it. We don’t have rules that are made by the gods somewhere. What we have is actually not rules at all, but agreements. Surely, agreeing to something and then, at your own convenience, un-agreeing to it, is the act of a cad. In fact, when you make an agreement, the agreement itself may well include the consequences of this kind of irresponsible behavior. If you’re a wild man and you agree to nothing—not even that you won’t just kill people randomly on the street—this is fine. Go and live in the jungle, or something. Don’t expect anyone to let you walk around on their street, any more than they would tolerate, say, a polar bear. There is no absolute moral principle that says that polar bears are evil, but their presence is just not compatible with modern urban living. We are starting to see two kinds of agreements here. There are agreements made with other specific individuals—I agree to paint your house, you agree to pay me. And there are agreements like, “I won’t kill anyone on the street.” But are these agreements really different? I don’t think so. I think the second kind of agreement is just your agreement with whoever owns the street . If wallets have owners, why shouldn’t streets have owners? Wallets have to have owners, obviously, because ultimately someone has to decide what happens with the wallet. Does it ride off in your pocket, or mine? Streets stay put, but there are still a lot of decisions that have to be taken—who paves the street? When and why? Are people allowed to kill people on the street, or is it one of those special no-killing streets? What about street vendors? And so on. Obviously, if I own 44th Street and you own 45th and 43rd, the possibility of a complex relationship between us becomes nontrivial. And complexity is next to ambiguity, which is next to uncertainty, and the Glocks come out again. So, realistically, we are probably talking more about owning not streets, but larger, more clearly-defined units—blocks, maybe, or even cities. Owning a city! Now that would be pretty cool. But it gets us back to an issue that we’ve completely skipped, which is who owns what. How do we decide? Do I deserve to own a city? Am I so meritorious? I think I am. Maybe you could keep your wallet, and I could get, say, Baltimore. There is this idea called social justice that a lot of people believe in. The notion is, in fact, fairly universal as of this writing. What it tells us is that Earth is small and has a limited set of resources, such as cities, which we all want as much of as possible. But we can’t all have a city, or even a street, so we should share equally. Because all of us people are equal and no one is more equal than anyone else. Social justice sounds very nice. But there are three problems with it. One is that many of these nice things are not directly comparable. If I get an apple and you get an orange, are we equal? One could debate the subject—with Glocks, perhaps. Two is that even if everyone starts with equal everything, people being different, having different needs and skills and so on, and the concept of ownership implying that if you own something you can give it to someone else, all is not likely to stay equal. In fact, it’s basically impossible to combine a system in which agreements stay agreed with one in which equality stays equal. This tells us that if we try to enforce permanent equality, we can probably expect permanent violence. I am not a big fan of “empirical evidence,” but I think this prediction corresponds pretty well to reality. But three, which is the real killer—so to speak—is that we are not, in fact, designing an abstract utopia here. We are trying to fix the real world, which in case you hadn’t noticed, is extremely screwed up. In many cases, there is no clear agreement on who owns what (Palestine, anyone?), but most of the good things in the world do seem to have a rather definite chain of control. If we have to start by equalizing the distribution of goods, or in fact by changing this distribution at all, we are putting ourselves quite unnecessarily behind the 8-ball. We are saying, we come in peace, we believe all should be free and equal, let us embrace. Put your arms around me. Feel that lump in my back pocket? Yup, that’s what you think it is. And it’s loaded. Now hand over your city/wallet/apple/orange, because I know someone who needs it more than you. The goal of formalism is to avoid this unpleasant little detour. Formalism says: let’s figure out exactly who has what, now , and give them a fancy little certificate. Let’s not get into who should have what. Because, like it or not, this is simply a recipe for more violence. It is very hard to come up with a rule that explains why the Palestinians should get Haifa back, and doesn’t explain why the Welsh should get London back. So far this probably sounds a lot like libertarianism. But there’s a big difference. Libertarians may think the Welsh should get London back. Or not. I am still not sure I can interpret Rothbard on this one—which is, as we’ve seen, in itself a problem. But if there is one thing all libertarians do believe, it’s that the Americans should get America back . In other words, libertarians (at least, real libertarians) believe the US is basically an illegitimate and usurping authority, that taxation is theft, that they are essentially being treated as fur-bearing animals by this weird, officious armed mafia, which has somehow convinced everyone else in the country to worship it like it was the Church of God or something, not just a bunch of guys with fancy badges and big guns. A good formalist will have none of this. Because to a formalist, the fact that the US can determine what happens on the North American continent between the 49th parallel and the Rio Grande, AK and HI, etc., means that it is the entity which owns that territory. And the fact that the US extracts regular payments from the aforementioned fur-bearing critters means no more than that it owns that right. The various maneuvers and pseudo-legalities by which it acquired these properties are all just history. What matters is that it has them now and it doesn’t want to give them over, any more than you want to give me your wallet. So if the responsibility to fork over some cut of your paycheck makes you a serf (a reasonable reuse of the word, surely, for our less agricultural age), that’s what Americans are—serfs. Corporate serfs, to be exact, because the US is nothing but a corporation. That is, it is a formal structure by which a group of individuals agree to act collectively to achieve some result. So what? So I’m a corporate serf. Is this so horrible? I seem to be pretty used to it. Two days out of the week I work for Lord Snooty-Snoot. Or Faceless Global Products. Or whoever. Does it matter who the check is written to? The modern distinction between “private” corporations and “governments” is actually a rather recent development . The US is certainly different from, say, Microsoft, in that the US handles its own security. On the other hand, just as Microsoft depends on the US for most of its security, the US depends on Microsoft for most of its software. It’s not clear why this should make one of these corporations special, and the other not-special. Of course, the purpose of Microsoft is not to write software, but to make money for its shareholders. The American Cancer Society is a corporation, too, and it has a purpose as well—to cure cancer. I have lost a lot of work on account of Microsoft’s so-called “software,” and its stock, frankly, is going nowhere. And cancer still seems to be around. In case the CEO of either MSFT or the ACS is reading this, though, I don’t really have a message for you guys. You know what you’re trying to do and your people are probably doing as good a job of it as they can. And if not, fire the bastards. But I have no idea what the purpose of the US is. I have heard that there’s someone who supposedly runs it. But he doesn’t appear to even be able to fire his own employees , which is probably good, because I hear he’s not exactly Jack Welch , if you know what I mean . In fact, if anyone can identify one significant event that has occurred in North America because Bush and not Kerry was elected in 2004, I’d be delighted to hear of it. Because my impression is that basically the President has about as much effect on the actions of the US as the Heavenly Sovereign Emperor, the Divine Mikado, has on the actions of Japan. Which is pretty much none. Obviously, the US exists. Obviously, it does stuff. But the way in which it decides what stuff it’s going to do is so opaque that, as far as anyone outside the Beltway is concerned, it might as well be consulting ox entrails . So this is the formalist manifesto: that the US is just a corporation. It is not a mystic trust consigned to us by the generations. It is not the repository of our hopes and fears, the voice of conscience and the avenging sword of justice. It is just an big old company that holds a huge pile of assets, has no clear idea of what it’s trying to do with them, and is thrashing around like a ten-gallon shark in a five-gallon bucket, red ink spouting from each of its bazillion gills. To a formalist, the way to fix the US is to dispense with the ancient mystical horseradish, the corporate prayers and war chants , figure out who owns this monstrosity, and let them decide what in the heck they are going to do with it. I don’t think it’s too crazy to say that all options—including restructuring and liquidation—should be on the table. Whether we’re talking about the US, Baltimore, or your wallet, a formalist is only happy when ownership and control are one and the same. To reformalize, therefore, we need to figure out who has actual power in the US, and assign shares in such a way as to reproduce this distribution as closely as possible. Of course, if you believe in the mystical horseradish, you’ll probably say that every citizen should get one share. But this is a rather starry-eyed view of the US’s actual power structure. Remember, our goal is not to figure out who should have what, but to figure out who does have what. For example, if the New York Times was to endorse our reformalization plan, it would be much more likely to happen. This suggests that the New York Times has quite a bit of power, and therefore that it should get quite a few shares. But wait. We haven’t answered the question. What is the purpose of the US? Suppose, solely for illustration, we give all the shares to the New York Times. What will “Punch” Sulzberger do with his shiny new country? Many people, probably including Mr. Sulzberger, seem to think of the US as a charitable venture. Like the American Cancer Society, just with a broader mission. Perhaps the purpose of the US is simply to do good in the world. This is a very understandable perspective. Surely, if anything ungood remains in the world, it can be vanquished by a gigantic, heavily armed mega-charity, with H-bombs, a flag, and 250 million serfs. In fact, it’s actually rather astounding that, considering the prodigious endowments of this great philanthropic institution, it seems to do so little good. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that it’s run so efficiently that it hasn’t balanced its budget since the 1830s. Perhaps, if you reformalized the US, ran it like an actual business, and distributed its shares among a large set of separate charities, each presumably with some specific charter for some actual specific purpose, more good might occur. Of course, the US doesn’t just have assets. Sadly, it also has debts . Some of these debts, such as T-bills, are already very well-formalized. Others, such as Social Security and Medicare, are informal and subject to political uncertainties. If these obligations were reformalized, their recipients could only benefit. Of course, they would thus become negotiable instruments and could be, for example, sold. Perhaps in exchange for crack. Reformalization thus requires us to distinguish between property and charity, a hard problem but an important one. All this fails to answer the question: are nation-states, such as the US, even useful? If you reformalized the US, the question would be left to its shareholders. Perhaps cities work the best when they’re independently owned and operated. If so, they should probably be spun off as separate corporations. The existence of successful city-states such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai certainly suggests an answer to this question. Whatever we call them, these places are remarkable for their prosperity and their relative absence of politics. In fact, perhaps the only way to make them more stable and secure would be to transform them from effectively family-owned (Singapore and Dubai) or subsidiary (Hong Kong) corporations, to anonymous public ownership, thus eliminating the long-term risk that political violence might develop. Certainly, the absence of democracy in these city-states has not made them comparable in any way to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. Any restrictions on personal freedom that they do maintain seem primarily aimed at preventing the development of democracy—an understandable concern given the history of rule by the People. In fact, both the Third Reich and the Communist world often claimed to represent the true spirit of democracy. As Dubai in particular shows, a government (like any corporation) can deliver excellent customer service without either owning or being owned by its customers. Most of Dubai’s residents are not even citizens. If Sheik Al Maktoum has a cunning plan to seize them all, chain them and make them work in the salt mines, he’s doing it in a very devious way. Dubai, as a place, has almost nothing to recommend it. The weather is horrible, the sights are nonexistent, and the neighborhood is atrocious. It’s tiny, in the middle of nowhere, and surrounded by Allah-crazed maniacs with a suspicious affinity for high-speed centrifuges. Nonetheless it has a quarter of the world’s cranes and is growing like a weed. If we let the Maktoums run, say, Baltimore, what would happen? One conclusion of formalism is that democracy is—as most writers before the 19th century agreed—an ineffective and destructive system of government. The concept of democracy without politics makes no sense at all, and as we’ve seen, politics and war are a continuum. Democratic politics is best understood as a sort of symbolic violence, like deciding who wins the battle by how many troops they brought. Formalists attribute the success of Europe, Japan and the US after World War II not to democracy, but to its absence. While retaining the symbolic structures of democracy, much as the Roman Principate retained the Senate, the postwar Western system has assigned almost all actual decision-making power to its civil servants and judges, who are “apolitical” and “nonpartisan,” i.e., nondemocratic. Because in the absence of effective external control, these civil services more or less manage themselves, like any unmanaged enterprise they often seem to exist and expand for the sake of existing and expanding. But they avoid the spoils system which invariably develops when the tribunes of the people have actual power. And they do a reasonable, if hardly stellar, job of maintaining some semblance of law. In other words, “democracy” appears to work because it is not in fact democracy, but a mediocre implementation of formalism. This relationship between symbolism and reality has received an educational if depressing test in the form of Iraq, where there is no law at all, but which we have endowed with the purest and most elegant form of democracy (proportional representation), and ministers who actually seem to run their ministries. While history does no controlled experiments, surely the comparison of Iraq to Dubai makes a fine case for formalism over democracy. next &raquo; UNQUALIFIED RESERVATIONS .

Palantir , a team of 250-plus engineers nestled in downtown Palo Alto, has raised $90 million in Series D financing at a $735 million valuation&#8212; the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by co-founder Peter Thiel&#8217;s The Founders Fund and included Youniversity Ventures, Glynn Capital, Miriam Rivera&#8217;s Ulu Ventures, Jeremy Stoppleman, Ben Ling, and a couple of high-profile NY funds. Although Palantir did not disclose whether it&#8217;s profitable, the company says revenues have at least doubled every year for the last three years. And yet this nearly billion dollar company&#8212; yes, that&#8217;s billion with a big fat &#8220;B&#8221;&#8212; remains a wallflower in Silicon Valley. Foursquare, a company founded in 2009, has at least 208 posts on TechCrunch. Palantir, founded in 2004, has one . Unlike the most buzzed about startups in tech, Palantir is not in the social game. It doesn&#8217;t dispense daily deals, nor does it accept mobile payments and it certainly does not Tweet. Techcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Scale faster.

Boston, MA | July 15 REGISTER NOW It is an obtuse, difficult-to-explain product that is mainly used in Washington&#8212; the government makes up 70% of its business and the rest is dominated by private financial institutions. That may sound painfully boring but Palantir&#8217;s user-friendly analysis program is becoming a major player in the war against terrorism and cyber espionage, stimulus spending accountability (Palantir is literally powering the administration&#8217;s efforts to identify fraud in stimulus projects), health care, and even natural disasters like the recent earthquake in Haiti. This year, the platform famously helped researchers at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto expose a cyber espionage ring called the Shadow Network, which was stealing classified materials from India&#8217;s Defense Ministry. Where there&#8217;s a crisis, it&#8217;s safe to say that Palantir is probably not far behind. Screenshot of a Palantir project: What is Palantir? To understand Palantir, it helps to start at the origin. The company is named after the Palantir stones of Lord Of The Rings, which allowed the characters to connect with other stones and see nearby images. The fundamental point of Palantir is to take reams of data and help non-technical users see critical connections and ultimately, the answers to complex problems. The product is a child of PayPal, born from the start up&#8217;s methodology for combating fraud: &#8220;They had this massive problem of essentially cyber fraud&#8230;they tried algorithmatic approaches&#8230;one of the things about that is it doesn&#8217;t work really well because the opponent is highly adaptive&#8230;What you need is a human mind that&#8217;s adaptive,&#8221; Karp says. That would form the foundation for the Palantir platform, which merges human-based algorithms and a powerful engine that can scan several databases at once on an incredibly fine, granular level. It comes in two flavors: Government and Finance. The basic system, which is designed to look like software from a Hollywood spy thriller, accepts huge databases and allows users to slice the information in seemingly innumerable ways. Unlike PayPal&#8217;s model, Palantir is also designed to be highly sensitive to a variety of security needs. At Palantir&#8217;s headquarters, Shreyas Vijaykumar (Forward Deployed Engineer) and Shyam Sankar (Director of Business Development) walked us through one simulation. We looked at a hypothetical E.Coli outbreak in Detroit, Michigan. We knew the approximate date of the outbreak and the fact that victims purchased meat at two different grocery chain. Using Palantir we were able to identify all the store locations in the area, find the meat distributors, isolate the stores that shared the same distributors and ultimately narrow it down to two distributors where the contamination may have originated. Not exactly fighting terrorists, but a pretty neat 10-minute activity. If it sounds convoluted, you can check out some of their demonstration videos here . Heat map of Somali pirate attacks: Unlike the many contractors it competes against, Karp emphasizes that the company does not provide a service, it will always be product oriented. That dogged loyalty to refining the flagship product permeates Palantir&#8217;s offices. For example, a software update is released every month&#8212; on the Palantir Government side, the engineers name the update by assigning an element from the periodic table and designing a shirt to commemorate the new update (yes, 250-plus t-shirts are printed each month). That spirit is further reinforced by the engineer-centric model&#8212; virtually every single employee is an engineer and roughly 27-years-old. Predictably, the office space is punctuated with extra-large bean bag chairs, a small community of dogs, board games, Halo (even conference rooms are named after parts of Halo), a working train set, paintings of Carebears, and even a bubble machine that spews bubbles when someone breaks the build. Of course, there is a downside to an engineer utopia working feverishly to perfect a platform. If everyone&#8217;s an engineer, who sells the product? The answer is no one. There is no publicist, no sales or marketing team and Karp adamantly believes that there will never be one. He says he is perfectly content to let word of mouth drive his business, in press and in sales. He knows he could multiply his revenues by building out a sales team, but he think it would ultimately detract from the mission: &#8220;If you are iterating on a product that you want to be important three years from now, it&#8217;s better to have engineers figuring out what the core issues are and then iterate against them. If you want to optimize on revenue [for the] next quarter&#8230;you want to be heavy on a sales force. We&#8217;re long on dealing with the most important problems&#8230;and short on what happens in the near term.&#8221; It&#8217;s hard to imagine a billion-dollar company without a sales team, but then again Palantir is getting pretty darn close.

Growth and Government,blog.samaltman,05/03/2013,https://blog.samaltman.com/growth-and-government,"Growth and Government - Sam Altman Manage Edit Post Logout Login Sam Altman &laquo;&nbsp;Back to blog Growth and Government TL;DR Without economic growth, democracy doesn’t work because voters occupy a zero-sum system. The first piece of startup wisdom I heard was “increasing your sales will fix all problems”. This turns out to be another way of phrasing Paul Graham’s point that growth is critical, which is true for all sorts of reasons—for example, justifying high valuations to raise large amounts of capital in the early days, attracting the best people and paying them with equity, providing a buffer to allow for some mistakes, and smoothing over internal tensions. I believe that growth is not only critical for startups, but for most systems. Either you’re growing, or you’re slowly dying. Perfect equilibrium is rare. One system that seems to be in early death throes is the United States government. There’s a lot of political rancor, which is particularly puzzling when one considers that in the 2012 presidential election, Obama and Romney said roughly the same thing. Dysfunction is high—the sequester, which was supposed to be so unpalatable it would never take effect, actually (and likely temporarily) happened last Friday because the parties couldn’t agree on an alternative. There’s a lot of arguing over insignificant issues—enough, in fact, to distract us from the fact that no one has new ideas on the big issues. We have trillion dollar deficits and no plan to reduce them, and yet the media focus on the sideshows. A good metric for government dysfunction is inability to pass a budget, either leading to a government shutdown or a continuing resolution, which lets agencies continue to operate on the previous budget, for a theoretically short time period until we can agree on a new one. Passing a budget is a fundamental job of Congress and the President. As far as I can tell, the US government managed to make it about 200 years without any shutdowns. We had one in 1976, and then a bunch more in the 70s and 80s, plus 3 in the 90s, including one that lasted 21 days. Shutdowns have fallen out of fashion, and now we just operate with continuing resolutions, and lots of them—for example, 21 for the 2001 budget alone. The real issue with shutdowns and continuing resolutions is the same—inability to agree on a federal budget. Every few months, there’s brief discussion of some sort of grand bargain, but it always ends in deferral—even the deferrals get deferred! Everyone feels screwed, and almost no one feels like the government is doing a great job. We can’t agree on anything, and anyone that proposes doing something radically different doesn’t get elected. But democracy (I’m using democracy to include republics and other forms of government where the people get an effectively direct say in who the leaders are) worked in the US for a long time—we were able to make real progress, pass budgets, be the world superpower, evolve as a country, etc. Something has changed. The US has been blessed with economic growth for a very long time, first due to natural resources and massive amounts of land in which to expand, and then due to a period of technological progress rarely matched in human history that lasted approximately until we realized just how dangerous nuclear bombs really were and got scared of new technology. But the frontier is long over, and although technological innovation has continued at a blistering rate for computers and the Internet, it seems to have slowed down in most other industries. Growth may be the root cause of American exceptionalism—things consistently got better every decade largely because we were growing. People from other countries wanted to live here, we led the world in technological innovation, social mobility was high because everyone was getting richer, and we had the resources to get involved around the world. This is still at least partially true. But growth has slowed quite a bit. Here is a graph of real GDP percentage growth in the United States from 1950 until now, with a trendline. The trendline goes from just under 5% to just under 2%. This is a much more significant drop than it appears, because it compounds exponentially. A shocking data point about how things are going is that the median real net worth for households headed by someone under 35 dropped 68% from 1984 to 2009, to $3,662 . For those over 65, it increased 42% to $170,494 (largely due to a gain in property values). This disparity is good evidence of a lack of real growth (and also a very unstable situation where an older generation benefits at the expense of a younger). Here are two more graphs, the first showing the US unemployment rate (the real numbers are perhaps worse, as people drop out of the work force) and the second showing the US interest rate, both of which make a case for slowing growth: All of that said, in absolute sense I’d much rather live in the world of today than 1950—it’s tough for me to imagine living in a world without the Internet. However, in the same way that one can feel acceleration but not velocity, people seem more sensitive to the annual rate of improvement than the absolute quality of life. So even though people should be happier in an absolutely better world, no one wants to stand still on the hedonic treadmill. Most of us want our lives to get better every year—the hedonic treadmill is a pain that way. In a democracy, we theoretically vote for what we believe will improve our lives the most. In a system with economic growth, things can improve for everyone. In a system without growth, or even one with very little growth, that’s not the case—if things improve for me, it has to come at the expense of things getting worse for you. Without growth, we’re voting against someone else’s interest as much as we’re voting for our own. This ends with lots of fighting and everyone feeling screwed, broken into factions, and unmotivated. Democracy does not work well in a zero-sum world. Autocratic political systems probably work better with growth too, but the effect of a lack of growth is likely less pronounced right up until the revolution. So we need to get growth back, unless we want to see this grand experiment end. Our politicians don’t seem to have any good ideas about how to do this. Saying “I believe in America” and hoping that proof by vigorous assertion starts working is not a strategy. I believe democracy only works in a non-zero-sum world. We are losing jobs that we will never get back, we are borrowing money and spending it on anything but real investment, and it feels like we are managing a slow decline. Without growth, we will head towards a special case of Malthusian dystopia where we have plenty of junk food but not enough of anything else. Growth is what we should be focusing on. Growth is great—it lets us run deficits, it means the country is not zero-sum, it lets us invest in innovation and continual improvement in infrastructure, it provides a buffer for a little mismanagement, and it means tomorrow will be better than today. Contrary to what one might expect, growth provides long-term stability. We must return to real growth, growth where we do more with less. Borrowing money to get ninety growth cents on the dollar does not count, although that may work for a while. We have to figure out how to fix the real problems with technological innovation—cheaper and cleaner energy, better healthcare (15.2% of GDP in 2008 and 18.2% of GDP in 2011), better transportation, food production, and defense. GDP growth is probably the only way to fix our national debt and entitlement problems, and it’d be better to have real growth than inflationary growth. How to best drive economic growth is a difficult question. It’s easy to say we should just invest in science and technology, and although that’s probably right it’s easier said than done. The government is historically bad at picking winners to invest in, but our leaders can perhaps help reverse the cultural shift from pro-science to anti-science. Our current culture has shifted to be anti-science; the fear of things like genetically modified food and robots is obviously in the way of growth. We should strive to make jobs in science and technology more appealing than jobs in finance (incidentally, it should be a big red flag for growth when the brightest young people start going into finance, since they aren’t actually creating any more wealth, just redistributing it). Startups are probably the best way to do this—startups let people that develop a new technology get rich, instead of just making GE slightly richer. So we should encourage startups in whatever way we can. Another issue is the structure of our national budget. We have, in startup parlance, a high burn, and most of it can’t be considered ‘investment’ but is instead ‘expense’. Spending money on things like infrastructure improvement or new technology that are likely to generate more money in the future helps growth; spending money on the so-called entitlement programs, and parts of the military, does not. Of course medical care and defense are important, and we have to have them—this is a tough balancing act. In some cases, the competitive nature of the private sector may provide a better path. Sooner or later, we are going to have an ugly conversation about our national budget—we can delay it for a long time but not forever. The government, when it needs to spend money at all, should aim to invest. Considering what will drive growth is a useful framework for thinking about the best use of resources. We should not fear innovation or globalization. Robots are going to replace human workers in lots of factories; jobs that do require human labor are going to continue to move to the lowest-cost place. But that’s ok, and these sorts of jobs are not what will generate economic growth for us anyway. We should strive to be a net exporter of ideas and technologies. For example, the US makes the best software in the world today. It’d be disastrous for us if that stopped happening. We should also design the best supersonic jet engines, the best nuclear power plants, and the best agricultural technology. We should understand that as a consequence of technology and an economy of ideas, the gap between the rich and the poor will likely increase from its already high-seeming levels. There is good and bad to this, but we should be careful not to legislate against it, which will hurt growth. Technology magnifies differences in innate ability; startups provide a framework to get compensated for it. But GDP growth ought to improve the quality of life for everyone, and no growth will reduce quality of life for everyone except the very rich. A safety net for legitimately poor people is a good thing, and probably becomes more necessary in a world with this sort of divergence. Quality of life should improve for everyone; the bigger issue will likely be that people are very sensitive to relative fairness. Pro-growth tax and legal changes are a good idea. As a consequence of a high burn rate, we have to have high taxes. But other countries don’t have this structural challenge, and so some other countries have lower tax rates than we do. That makes them an appealing place to start a business or live. By reducing our burn rate, we can reduce taxes. We don’t need to go crazy here—there are a lot of other factors that make the US a very attractive place to start a new company. But it would certainly help. And tax policy should reward activity that drives growth. There are some easy legal changes we can make to increase growth. Immigration for entrepreneurs and skilled technology workers is an obvious one; we should want the best people creating value here, not elsewhere in the world. Tort reform is another—legal protection is of course important, but it’s gotten so silly that it discourages innovation. There is a lot more we can do. Most of it is difficult, but growth it is the critical issue. As a closing thought, the Airbnb founders used to draw a forward-looking growth graph that they wanted to hit. It was their number one priority; they put it up on their desks, on their refrigerator, and on the mirror in their bathroom. You build what you measure, and they built growth. That seemed to work pretty well for them. It’s not as easy if you’re the US government. But probably not impossible, either, and it would at least point us in the right direction.

That’s what’s so scary. When the most elitest minds of a society are full of blithering idiocy , that society is probably doomed. It’s normal for geniuses to be crazed . But Sam Altman (whom I don’t know, but SF is a small town and I probably know someone who knows him) isn’t a genius and he definitely isn’t crazed. He didn’t analyze any ten-dimensional gauge theory or predict any chiral axigluons. He’s just an entrepreneur, i.e., a natural leader, a commodity which especially in our present dire straits is or at least ought to be worth a whole Bolivian prison full of cocaine-tooting particle physicists . What I find exceptionally terrifying is that Altman’s blithering idiocy looks and sounds exactly like sober good sense . Read it. You’ll agree. The basic problem with our society is a disconnect between consensus reality and actual reality. We actually have no shortage of natural leaders. But they cannot actually lead us anywhere. They are operating in consensus reality rather than actual reality. Their joysticks are not plugged in. When the consensus is nonsense, sober good sense is nonsense. Nonsense is no use to anyone. Really? Can blithering idiocy sound like sober good sense? Let’s try some: All of that said, in absolute sense I’d much rather live in the world of today than 1950—it’s tough for me to imagine living in a world without the Internet. However, in the same way that one can feel acceleration but not velocity, people seem more sensitive to the annual rate of improvement than the absolute quality of life. So even though people should be happier in an absolutely better world, no one wants to stand still on the hedonic treadmill . Most of us want our lives to get better every year—the hedonic treadmill is a pain that way. The world of 1950! Oh, honey. Okay, let’s apply a gross reality check. You’re an alien. You’re observing Earth with an infinitely powerful telescope from Alpha Centauri. You have a simple question. Since 1950, has human civilization—or American civilization, which amounts to pretty much the same these days—advanced or declined? Apparently the easiest way for Sam Altman to answer the question is to trade it for a different one. He is not alone in this. He asks: since 1950, has human technology advanced or declined? Clearly, the alien, you, I, and Sam Altman all have the same answer to this question. Any question with an obvious answer is a stupid question. “Is an iPad more advanced than a Smith-Corona?” is a stupid question. Who asks stupid questions? Obviously, blithering idiots. But we can compose an interesting question by factoring out the stupid question. Which world would Sam Altman rather live in? 2013, with iPads and teh Internet? Or 1950—with iPads and teh Internet? In a sense, this 1950 is just as real as the “real” 1950. Neither exists. Sam Altman cannot pack his bags and move to either the real 1950 or my imaginary super-1950. Both exist only as thought experiments. It is not hard to construct or define the super-1950, though—one run of a time machine, with a printout of Wikipedia, would be pretty much all the real 1950 needed. Send the technology back to 1945, and you’ll have iPads by ’55 at the latest. Those guys got things done. The interesting (and scary) question this thought-experiment asks is whether, aside from technical progress , human civilization has advanced or declined since 1950. In actual reality, this too is a stupid question. The answer is no less obvious—I assert. But consensus reality thinks I’m crazy. So with stupid we must begin. Aside from technical progress, has human civilization advanced or declined since 1950? By what criterion? If Moore’s Law is not our benchmark of a successful civilization—what is? Sam Altman has his answer. The hedonic treadmill! Never having sold a startup for $43 mil , there are many subtle, refined and delicious forms of hedonism of which I am as innocent as a cat of tennis. But allowing (for a moment) this implicit assumption that the purpose of civilization is the satisfaction of human desires , we can refer only to Maslow’s pyramid of needs . At the base of the pyramid are air, water and food. How does 2013 do at supplying oxygen, hydration and nutrition? How did 1950 do? Just fine. Gentlemen, a draw. (The food of 2013 is certainly tastier than that of 1950, at least in America. But this is not the base of the pyramid.) Next up: safety and security. All right, gentlemen. Let’s have another thought-experiment. Picture the Earth—our beautiful, blue, spinning globe. Take all the habitable land area and color it white—as a neutral background for our thought experiment. Now, select the subset of this beautiful planet on which a sober, sensible, civilized person, such as Sam Altman, would consider it prudent and safe to wander, “ on foot and alone ,” carrying his iPad, at night. Leave that part white. Color the other part brown. Then, from the brown subset, select the further subset in which Sam Altman, carrying his iPad, would not consider it prudent and safe to wander in the daytime . Color that part black . (Why can’t Google Maps do this?) Then do the same for Sam Altman’s grandfather, in 1950, with his portable Smith-Corona. Then, repeat the exercise for 1900. (Part of the reason this is such a useful mental exercise, and unfortunately such a difficult one, is that it requires you to actually know what the world was like in 1950 or 1900. If your way of getting this information starts with statistical tables, ur doin it rong. There are these things called “books” which will help you out.) If you perform this exercise accurately, or at least if you get the same results as me, you’ll see a 20C quite indistinguishable from Stage III melanoma. And this progress continues, to rousing applause and general self-congratulation, right up into our own dear official NYT-approved 2013. Hey, been to Egypt lately? What’s that Google guy up to these days? Is he still tweeting? Speaking of Twitter, I experience this reality check in person every day. My daughter’s preschool is at 10th and Howard, two blocks from Twitter HQ. It’s actually not too hard to park at 10th and Howard. So the average number of what my daughter calls “dangerous persons,” and what to an ordinary grownup are basically indistinguishable from zombies, that I and my bubbly daughter have to navigate around between the car door and the security guard is… I don’t know… 1.3? 1.7? It can’t be much more than 2. They’re just zombies and really they’re not that dangerous. (I think even zombies can sense that when I’m with a child, I am more dangerous to them than the converse.) On the other hand, a couple months ago a techie (not a Twitter employee) was hit on the head and killed, presumably by zombie or zombies unknown, at 11th and Mission . Right around the corner from Tweet Central. Besides a couple of perfunctory boilerplate stories, and of course the victim’s wife, no one noticed. No one cared. Why would they? Their iPads have 4.7 million pixels . Suffice it to say that if you don’t know how 1950 would have reacted to exactly the same event, in exactly the same place, you don’t know anything about 1950. Actually, my daughter’s preschool is literally in a ruin —that is, a (nicely renovated) space which used to be part of a Catholic church. (The preschool is the former convent. The rest of the church remains a ruin proper.) Where are the people who used to pray in this church? They fled . Why? Because they were afraid for their physical safety . I know, I know. It’s gauche to even bring this kind of stuff up. It’s not part of our consensus reality. It’s not part of our consensus history . When it comes to actual history, however, the global decline of security in the second half of the 20th century is (I assert) the salient phenomenon of our era. Much as the fall of the Roman Empire is the salient phenomenon of 4th-century AD Europe. (Note that while our historians would desperately love to find one, just one, member of the exquisitely literate 4th-century AD European culture who would even mention that the Roman Empire was falling apart, no such luck. It’s all wall-to-wall Prudentius and Sidonius .) Consider our alien in Alpha Centauri. His telescope is just a telescope. He no speaka the English. He is absolutely invulnerable to our most respected propaganda authorities and in particular has no way to read the great Harvard scholar Steven Pinker —truly a Prudentius for our age—who has discovered through elaborate statistical models that the 20C was not, in fact, the golden age of titanic mass murder and brazen petty crime , but the dawning of a new age of Aquarius in which all will have peace and prosperity. (Even Pinker is a piker next to the Times, which has published at least 547 stories about NYC’s miraculous conquest of its blatantly managed crime statistics, and precisely 2 about the hospital statistics which show a parallel doubling in actual assault victims. It’s always so easy to lie to those who want to be lied to—you hardly even need statistics.) But his is an excellent telescope. So our alien can see the fact that many parts of all, and all parts of some, American cities that were thriving in 1950, have now fallen into chaos and ruin. On the other hand, he can gaze admiringly at the thriving cafes of University Avenue in Palo Alto, Ausonius’ Moselle born anew, full of beautiful young people adoring the perfectly antialiased individual subpixels of their new Retina iPads. Which of these phenomena will he find more relevant? Which is the narrative, which the distraction? Continuing the comparison to the fall of Rome, one of the interesting features we see is that while technological competence is certainly an indicator of a successful civilization, it is also a lagging indicator. Civilization produces technology, not the other way around. When civilization falls, technology is not the first but the last thing to fall. Yes, technology does decline in the fall of Rome. No, it has not declined in our era—though its advance has certainly slowed a great deal. But the centuries of European technology decline are 400–700 AD, a point at which surely any historian would admit that the Roman polity has already been going to the dogs for two centuries minimum. Am I too hard on Sam Altman? After all, he admits there’s a problem. He doesn’t admit this problem—but isn’t his point basically the same? That something isn’t working? My America is going to the dogs and lies in ruins all around me. His America has just turned the friction up too high on its hedonic treadmill. But it’s the same, isn’t it? Sort of? Realizing that something in the 20th-century model of governance, as taught by the best and brightest of Harvard, Stanford, the NYT and other fine institutions of papally infallible veracity, isn’t working out quite right , is indeed a step in the right direction. Everybody’s going to have their own particular beef. Mine, as we’ve seen, is that 75 years of this rigorously scientific system of government has reduced what was once America’s fourth-largest city to a demon-haunted slum —and while extreme, this outcome is anything but an exception. But so far as I can tell, from the Sam Altman perspective, this is just a nitpick. Or maybe it’s really sad, but would have happened to any regime. Napoleon, Cato the Elder, Pericles, Peter the Great— morons ! None of them could have done a damned thing to save Detroit, Oakland, Baltimore, etc. Not where Harvard failed! It’s always easy to attribute bad outcomes to irresistible forces of nature, acts of God, etc. Even if you can’t identify the force of nature and you don’t believe in God. No—Sam Altman is concerned with something entirely different. He is concerned with a number . This number is about 2, he asserts, when it should be more like 5. He calls this number “growth.” Or to be more exact, an even more interesting number, “real growth.” Growth is of course a good thing, especially if you’re a startup but unless you’re a tumor . Once again, this remarkable number— GDP growth —is an essential part of the 20C tradition of economic governance. Where would we be without Abba Lerner ? Well, I don’t know. Where would Detroit be without Abba Lerner? Where was Detroit… before Abba Lerner? Perhaps the problem with Sam Altman is just that everything he knows about economics he learned at Stanford, whereas everything I know about economics I learned by watching Hardcore Pawn . What does this number actually mean? It clearly means something . We know it goes up when people are happy, generally, and down when they are sad. Perhaps the great historical puzzle of the 20C is the need to explain this strange phenomenon, broadly defined, of Keynesian economics—which on the one hand seems to make no sense at all , but on the other hand seems to, kind of, work. At least on a local level. Well, okay, I lied. Yes— Hardcore Pawn is very important to me. But really I’m a mercantilist , and everything I know about economics I learned by reading Friedrich List . Well, him and Mises . Odd bedfellows I know. But I really believe there is nothing in (to use its old name) political economy which is outside the philosophy of these two fine Teutonic gentlemen, 1 opposites though they were. Please allow me to explain “growth” in this unusual Austro-mercantilist idiom. Growth is the change in a number called “GDP.” To an Austro-mercantilist there are two kinds of GDP, which we call AGDP (actual GDP, i.e., an actually measured number) and FGDP (fudged GDP, which is AGDP multiplied by a mysterious fudge factor ). With its usual fine subtle sense of irony, 20C economics calls AGDP “ nominal GDP ” and FGDP “ real GDP .” 20C economics is especially adept at accounting identities. The late great Murray Rothbard once parodied one of its finest absurdities, the equation of exchange , as: “the amount of water that runs off the ground is the same as the amount of rain that falls from the sky.” Which is true. But not particularly useful to the weather forecaster. So let’s apply one of these identities to understand AGDP. Forget foreign trade, which we’ll add back in in a sec, and consider an isolated unit like a planet. How do we measure the economic production of the planet? We arbitrarily divide economic actors, with some difficulty but not too much, into “consumers” and “producers”—i.e., peasants and businesses. AGDP is simply the total sales of all businesses to all peasants. I.e., if all businesses were One Giant Business—you can see the attraction of this approach to the mid-20C central planner, snorting boa-thick lines of pure administrative Bolivian as he plays SimCity with real peasants—AGDP is simply the gross revenues of this monster. And because the amount of water that runs off the ground is the same as the amount of rain that falls from the sky, AGDP is also the number of dollars that consumers spent this year at OGB. I like this approach because it reduces the veiled mystery of “growth” to a crass urban reality that everyone can understand. What does “growth” mean? It means: “spend more, comrades!” If growth is good by definition, spending is good by definition. Because the amount of water that runs off the ground is the same as the amount of rain that falls from the sky. Aggregate demand is your friend. Spend more, comrades! It’s good for the economy. How do you increase AGDP? There are two and only two ways. One, give the peasants more dollars (and/or reduce their debt). Two, make them less thrifty and more prodigal. Why is AGDP not increasing fast enough for the likes of Sam Altman? Or for that matter, Paul Krugman? Because both these levers are already pushed down to the floor. Or at least the second one is. The first one… we’ll get there. But wait—why increase AGDP? Why is more spending inherently better than less spending? There are two answers to this question, corresponding to your understanding of the purpose of an economy. The first is the false position held by Austrians, and by Keynesians when they want to confuse you: the belief that the purpose of economic activity is the satisfaction of human desires. More spending means more production, and more production means more satisfaction. This perspective, of course, originates with 18th- and 19th-century liberals and utilitarians. You can see it all over Sam Altman’s hedonic treadmill. This false position leads us down the path of FGDP. Let’s explore. Why the fudge factor? Because our goal is not to merely assess the price of all goods produced, a mere number which can be measured by mundane if fallible techniques, and still worse can actually be defined —but their value , that is, hedonic utility . This is an almost spiritual and essentially qualitative and personal assessment. In usual 20C style, we damn the torpedoes and jam this subjective quality into an objective quantity by any means necessary. Otherwise, how would we model it? For example: how much more fun of a computer is an iPad than an Apple II? Is it 37.6 times more fun? Or 198.2 times more fun? Or even 547.9? It would seem clear, to anyone not a blithering idiot, that any process which claims to be able to derive any such number is retarded at best and may well constitute felony math abuse. Not at all! The Bureau of Labor Statistics is, in fact, in possession of exactly this figure. Here’s how they do it. Since Apple was selling computers continuously from Apple II to iPad, we can look at the period when both the Apple II and Apple III were on sale, divide the list price of the Apple III by the Apple II; later, the Mac 512K by the Apple III, and so on until we reach the iPad. This process is called hedonic regression . It is thoroughly official—approved of by both Harvard and the US Government. So who’s the blithering idiot now? What’s especially awesome is to imagine a world with a sane financial system in which the quantity of money (perhaps Bitcoin) is fixed, and so are the time preferences of consumers. As a result, AGDP does not change. AGDP growth is zero by definition in this model. But in such a world, nothing prevents the hedonic quality of technology from increasing. Computers can get better. Indeed they should. And FGDP can increase—though all FGDP increases are due to the GDP deflator, i.e., hedonic fudge. Now, consider the logical situation of the Altman position (also held, I think, by Peter Thiel —and certainly not uncommon among otherwise sensible thinkers) in this constant-money, constant AGDP model. The argument is that we want “real” (FGDP) rather than “inflationary” (AGDP) economic growth, and the only path to this “real” growth is technology advancement. True enough! In fact, it’s so true that it’s… a tautology. With constant AGDP, we’ve removed all the variables from the equation. Oops. When AGDP inflation, which none of these technology prophets wants to talk about, falls out of the equation, the argument that “we need technical progress to spur growth” turns into… simply the hedonic treadmill. It expands to “2013 isn’t fun enough, so let’s get more and better technology to make 2014 more fun than 2013, because otherwise our fun sensors are all burned out and 2014 will be boo-oring.” Well, sure! I, for instance, am seriously confused about why everyone in 2013 is still wearing headphones with wires. What’s with Bluetooth A2DP ? Doesn’t it work? And definitely, they should speed it up with that Google Glass thing. If that ain’t hedonic I don’t know what is. Especially when it comes to pr0n . Certainly the BLS is falling down on the job if pr0n isn’t part of their GDP deflator. OMG, pr0n—what could be more hedonic than pr0n? Google Glass + pr0n—that’s what. As Glenn Reynolds puts it: faster, please! But, you know, this “2013 isn’t fun enough” argument really doesn’t tell us anything at all about why Detroit is a ruin. It doesn’t tell us why Baltimore is a ruin. It doesn’t tell us why Oakland is a ruin. It doesn’t tell us why Stockton is sinking into the Sacramento River, or why Newark could absorb all of Mark Zuckerberg’s personal net worth without becoming anything at all like Cherry Hill . What’s happened here is that, starting with an absurdity, we have reasoned ourselves into nonsense. Or at least, into pr0n. Our premise was that the purpose of economic activity is hedonism, i.e., the satisfaction of human desires. Certainly, technology can satisfy human desires. Pr0n can too, and so can heroin. (In fact, it would be interesting if the BLS could determine which is more hedonic: the original iPad, plus heroin, or the Retina with 4.7 million pixels and maybe just a little codeine to take the edge off. This could be computed easily, and with impeccable quantitative rigor, by combining Apple price series with the latest data from Silk Road .) 2 This absurdity happens to be the consensus reality. Yet it is no less absurd. Let’s put on our John Carpenter sunglasses and look at the real reality, terrifying though it is. Surely if you can read all the way down in an essay this long, you can handle the real reality. 3 In actual reality, we are trying to answer the question: how should America be governed? We are therefore reasoning from the perspective of the State. Since sovereignty is conserved, the State is always and everywhere absolute and omnipotent. Therefore, the hedonic satisfaction of its citizens, who are in fact its slaves, is not and cannot be a goal. It may be a means to an end, of course. As when we administer heroin through the barracks water supply to reward Camp #127 for exceeding its uranium production targets three months in a row. Well, see. I told you reality was scary. I don’t actually believe absolute government, which is always and everywhere the reality, implies totalitarian government. USG is an absolute government as well. I am not a big USG fan. But I don’t seem to find myself in the uranium mines. In general, the classic 20C phenomena of totalitarianism appears not in absolute governments that are secure and invulnerable, but in extremely weak ones that in consequence have to take extraordinary measures to repress their enemies. This (among other things) is the difference between Louis XIV and Stalin. USG’s great virtue is that its monopoly of power is far more secure than Louis XIV’s, so it doesn’t have to give a damn what I post on my stupid blog. But if we are analyzing real governments in the real world, our financial analysis has to be rooted in political reality. The political reality is that “citizens” are not owners of their government, but rather assets—in other words, slaves. Our only hope is for a regime that’s more Thomas Jefferson and less Simon Legree . Fortunately, as we’ll see, this analysis aligns the financial interests of the State with our own interests as human beings. What are the financial interests of the absolute State? To maximize the value of its productive assets. The State’s assets are (a) land and buildings, (b) equipment, and (c) human chattel. We understand how to value and manage (a) and (b) just fine. But most of its equity consists of (c)—an asset not really taught in most business schools. (Fortunately you still have those yellow old stacks of DeBow’s Review .) There is another way to ask whether, excluding advances in technology (which do fall under (c), since technology is a human ability—but hard to monopolize), America is a more valuable nation in 2013 than it was in 1950. We can ask: is the average American a better human being than his or her ancestors of 1950? I.e.: has the USG cultivated its human capital, or wasted it? For example: is this person—this asset, this slave—a harder worker? We’ll assume the State cannot change his IQ, because I have seen no evidence that it can—but is he more knowledgeable? Is he more moral, more physically healthy, wiser and more prudent? A better father, a better mother? Again, I believe the answer is obvious. There are certainly some ways in which the average American of 2013 is a better person than his grandfather. He is probably a better feminist, for instance. He is much less likely to be an anti-Semite, homophobe, etc. These factors don’t really affect his economic value, but perhaps they’re worth mentioning anyway. On the other hand, the American of 2013 is much more likely to be a meth-head, a thug or ho, a worthless trustafarian slacker, etc., etc., etc. Especially when we look at non-elite ethnic subpopulations—“ cracker ” Scots-Irish, African Americans, etc. (though if we listen to Ron Unz , even the Jews are going to the dogs)—I don’t think any serious person could really claim that the average American is superior as a human being to his grandparents. You might as well assert that the original iPad was teh greatness but this Retina crap they’re making these days is just lame. What’s notable about this interpretation is that, again, your interests and your government’s are just about perfectly aligned. You don’t want to be a heroin addict. Washington doesn’t want its slaves to be heroin addicts. You want to be a better person—more informed, more reliable, more capable. As a better person, you are a better and more valuable capital asset. You augment your government’s market cap. Back to Sam Altman: Most of us want our lives to get better every year—the hedonic treadmill is a pain that way. As “hedonic” implies, “better” means “more fun.” Obviously this is the attitude you’d expect from someone born in the Bush administration. Could it be any other way? Us old Nixon fogeys have pretty much exhausted the hedonic treadmill. There’s not much left of your hedonic treadmill after the 17th time cleaning up baby hork in the middle of the night. At that point (yes, new parents, it does get better) a nice glass of wine and a dinner out with your wife is more or less the hedonic equivalent of a meth-fueled threeway with strippers. Most of us want to become better people every year. We’re pretty confident, perhaps falsely, that this will lead to more hedonic rewards in the long run or at least has the best chance of doing so. But this isn’t the goal. The goal, believe it or not, is to become better people. And ideally our children will be even better than us. So again—the market cap goes up. Everything I’m saying here (including the economics) was said by Carlyle more than 150 years ago, notably in Chartism . The apotheosis of the hedonic principle is the immortal Pig-Philosophy . Briefly, Carlyle tells us, the difference between man and beast is that maximization of hedonic utility is always and everywhere the method of a beast. Not coincidentally, it is also the method of a toddler. And it is also the method of the Austrian economist, although he at least realizes that the “utility function” is qualitative and subjective rather than quantitative and objective, and adds time preference . To Mises and Rothbard, the human being as economic actor is a very smart pig, often willing to exchange less slop today for more slop tomorrow. This is not at all the view of Carlyle—nor is it the view of List. Of course, from the economic perspective of the State, slop production is all that matters. But the human being is not only an economic actor—nor is the State only an agency of production. What we’d really like to see is a model in which there is no tension between Pig-Philosophy (which must be acknowledged as true) and actual human civilization. We are now in a position to attack the mystery of “growth.” Why, if economic hedonism is such a shallow and easily debunked philosophy, do so many people take “growth” so seriously? All subterfuges and evasions to the contrary, the basic economic problem faced by 20th-century governments (somewhat less in the 19C; far more in the 21C) is unemployment. The cause of unemployment is simple: in an industrial economy, most human beings are economically useless. They are not productive assets at all. They are liabilities. For a brief transitional period, they could still be used as industrial robots. This period is close to its end. For instance, suppose a Sam Altman were given plenary power over the US economy, reorganized into One Giant Business. His mission: cut costs, while maintaining production. His methods: eliminate white-collar busywork (real estate agents, lawyers, medical billing clerks, etc.); replace human industrial robots with actual industrial robots; and when all else fails, replace high-cost American labor with low-cost Indians housed in barracks and fed only on lentils, Dubai-style. Does anyone doubt that aggressive and autocratic application of these methods could reduce US employment by 5 to 10 percent a year for at least a decade? Indeed, as the Singularity nears, the future of work becomes clear—there is an IQ threshold below which any human, no matter how cheap to feed, is a liability. Classic unskilled manual labor remains productive in some domains—gardening, housecleaning, and so on. Perhaps this will be true for another decade or two. It will not be true indefinitely. As the machines get smarter—assuming they get smarter—the threshold will rise. Eventually, the only human beings worth employing will be Sam Altman and his friends. Then, at last, even they will be laid off. Universal unemployment is the definition of the Singularity. Now, it’s important to note that from a strictly economic perspective, there is no problem here at all. The absolute State as Pig-Philosopher has a simple answer. As Stalin put it—no person, no problem. These surplus human robots can simply be sacrificed, like worn-out lab mice. At this point they stop being liabilities and become assets again, since they can be sold as organs or at least organ meats. Certainly, when the State itself becomes a computer, this logic will be irresistible. Let’s call this approach to human liabilities Solution A. From a political perspective, Solution A is a nonstarter. Hopefully it will always remain a nonstarter. If we are entirely wedded to Pig-Philosophy, we can explain this by saying that sacrificing human liabilities (especially within earshot) actually damages the capital value of the non-sacrificed pigs, because it terrifies and demoralizes them. But is this true? Might it not motivate them, instead? Whatever. There are more things in my philosophy than pigs, and yours too as well, and while I am quite willing to take a King I draw the line at a Computer-King—especially if the Computer-King is programmed entirely with Pig-Philosophy. Since I am more tolerant in this regard than most, I just don’t see Solution A happening. We move on to Solution B, which I think is the solution most people believe in. Work? Who the hell wants to work? Work is anti-hedonic by definition. If it didn’t have negative utility, it wouldn’t be work. So, it’s supposed to be a problem that in the future, work will be obsolete, and we’ll be able to produce goods and services without any human labor at all? That doesn’t sound like a problem to me. It sounds like a victory. The problem with Solution B is that we’ve already tried it, quite extensively. You see Solution B every time you go to the grocery store. Next to the button marked “Debit/Credit” is one marked “EBT.” Ever pressed that one? Even just by mistake? It’s the Solution B button. America has entire cities that have moved beyond anti-hedonic labor disutility and entered the gleaming future of Solution B. One of them is called “Detroit.” Solution B is not the culmination of human civilization, it turns out, but its destruction. Even in terms of mere Pig-Philosophy, it is destructive, because it ruins a human asset. If we appraise humans as robots, we see that this is a special kind of robot: it rusts up if not continually operating. As beasts, we are beasts who evolved to work. Our species achieved world domination as a result of our capacity for work. To feed and entertain a human being, without requiring productive effort or at least some simulation of it, is in the end just a way to destroy him—not too different from Solution A. There are some human beings, Sam Altman presumably among them, who are natural aristocrats. They can acquire the resources they would need to never work again, and still continue to work . While this is lovely, we need to face the reality that the human species is what it is. The population does not consist largely or even significantly of natural aristocrats. Not, for instance, in Detroit. “Dead corpses, the rotting body of a brother man, whom fate or unjust men have killed, this is not a pleasant spectacle; but what say you to the dead soul of a man,—in a body which still pretends to be vigorously alive, and can drink rum ?” 4 Carlyle knew all about Hardcore Pawn . Beyond the creepy A and B, all solutions to the problem involve a State which compels, through economic or other means (it hardly matters), humans who are not economically productive to submit to work or some simulation thereof. For instance, especially with the Oculus Rift , technology is beginning to present us with a Solution C, which combines physical imprisonment with virtual enrichment. It’s not clear what a life-scale virtual environment would consist of, but it would surely involve work or something like it. I don’t find Solution C particularly creepy, but I may be alone in this. It is certainly less creepy than A or B. I suspect that if it was done right, the customers would vastly prefer it to their present vile circumstances. But I also suspect it will never happen. Beyond A, B, and C, we enter the domain of solutions which involve distorting labor markets to integrate these human liabilities into some semblance of a normal institution of production. Solution D is the obvious approach and has been practiced by regimes around the world since Cheops was a little boy: to keep the peasants fit, healthy and happy, pay them to do otherwise unnecessary work. Like, you know, building pyramids . There is an apocryphal anecdote which illustrates Solution D perfectly. It probably never happened. A famous American economist— Milton Friedman , perhaps—is visiting China, perhaps in the ’80s, and sees a construction project where workers are digging a canal, with picks and shovels. “Why not use bulldozers?” the economist suggests. “But Professor Friedman,” his host points out, “this is a jobs project.” “Oh!” says the apocryphal professor. “Well, in that case, why are they using picks? Why not give them spoons?” While this is meant to illustrate the supposed idiocy of Solution D, it actually illustrates the design space. The purpose of Solution D is to lose as little money as possible, while maintaining the human quality of your assets and preventing them from degenerating into Hardcore Pawn customers, 10th St. zombies or other revolting parodies of the human condition. Digging ditches with appropriate hand tools is a simple and almost ennobling, in its own small way, form of manual labor which is ideally suited to the condition of most humans, delicate aristocrats perhaps excepted. (It is possible to construct makework for delicate aristocrats , but it takes more imagination.) Digging ditches with spoons is a degrading punishment appropriate only for refractory pedophiles. Since there is never any shortage of ditches you’d rather have than not, there is no need to issue spoons—unless the purpose of the project is exemplary degradation. So what’s the problem? Why isn’t USG sending its millions of gangstaz, its hundreds of thousands of zombies, and its uncountable hordes of ordinary young people who just can’t find a damn job, to self-improvement-through-labor facilities where they create gleaming new national parks , which no one ever visits, on the North Slope of Alaska? It might seem illiberal, but it can’t be— FDR did it . In general, makework programs are restricted to strong governments. Ours is a large government, but by no means a strong one. FDR’s was a strong one. When a strong government wants to “create jobs,” it just hires people. If the product is useless and the work is just makework, it says so. The strong are confident and can tell the truth. A weak government has to shroud the truth in a cloak of lies—it has to convincingly pretend that our great nation may be doomed without substantial and immediate improvements to “ Gates of the Arctic National Park .” Oddly, makework, a superior solution by any standard, is a softer political target than good old Solution B welfare. Makework has to be defended by lies, whereas welfare is indefensible. The defenders of welfare are therefore forced into the brazen fortress of property—they and their clients must assert that they are entitled to these emoluments, which is of course the one thing they ain’t. But, having established adverse possession , they make a pretty good go of retaining it. Politically, the ideal way to apply Solution D is to make the actual work as separate as possible from the source of funding. This brings us back to AGDP and “growth.” (You didn’t think we were digressing , did you?) Politically, the best way to fund and operate makework is to make it indistinguishable from the rest of the economy. If you tax productive citizens $1T a year to employ 10 million Americans to build, with hand tools, a 1:1 copy of Rome at the base of Mount Igikpak , you create a giant political target for stupid unruly peasants who persist in not understanding the genius of Lord Keynes . If instead, you manage to inflate aggregate consumer spending by $1T, you create ordinary jobs for ordinary Americans all across America—because where does that $1T go? Some of it winds up as profit, of course—but most of it goes into the costs of production, i.e., labor costs. I.e., creating jobs. The love is spread all over the country as a delicious buttery layer of prosperity. No one votes against prosperity. Ever. Of course, you’re still annoying the people you tax. Nor is it possible to pump tax money directly into consumer spending. It has to go through government spending instead. This makes two targets: the taxation and the spending. It can be managed. But it also can be improved. Suppose you borrow instead of taxing? This is better because no one feels the bite. However, government borrowing—which, as we’ve discovered, is identical in every way to mere “money printing,” i.e., equity issuance, since fiat currency is government equity and there is no real accounting distinction between Fed and Treasury, or between Fed notes and Treasury obligations—still has a downside. The downside is that it’s reported and has to appear in the newspapers—alarming the stupid peasants who persist in not understanding the genius of Lord Keynes, instead believing that Washington has to pay back its debts as though it were some stupid peasant. Moreover, even the most dedicated bureaucrat who is more Keynesian than Keynes himself feels a slight sense of alarm about the indiscriminate use of this privilege, because somewhere in the back of his reptile brain he understands what he is doing: imposing a stealth capital levy on the wealthy, by diluting the dollar supply. Suppose dollar holders evaded this tax, which after all is a tax, by switching to some other monetary asset? Gold? Bitcoin? Honus Wagner baseball cards ? Besides, if the dollars have to pass through Washington, the spending side remains a target. Therefore, absolutely the best way to inflate AGDP is to increase private-sector capitalization , generating a wealth effect . Moreover, there are two ways to do this, since there are two forms of capital asset: debt and equity. Debt is dangerous because it has to be paid back. More on this in a moment. So we have a second-best way to inflate AGDP, convincing the private sector to borrow more; and a first-best way, making the stock market and real estate go up. The latter is solution D-1, the absolute bestest way (from a political perspective) to create jobs, and the mainstay of the Greenspan-Bernanke era of American prosperity. In short, our actual reality. The former is solution D-2, as practiced in the great nation of China . (And, wonderfully, Angola .) Is there a downside? Of course there is. Capitalization (debt or equity) is supposed to reflect actual capital. When you increase capitalization (debt or equity) without a corresponding creation of productive assets, you are storing up trouble. Excessive market cap is like nuclear waste. If it gets out, as in 2008 —you have a problem. Fortunately, this problem can always be solved by solution D-3, printing money to buy nuclear waste. Note that all of this is a question of financial alchemy. None of it has anything at all to do with the resolution on your iPad, or other technology ingredients that go into computing the FGDP hedonic deflator. It is all a matter of AGDP. It’s true that AGDP inflation is reflected in FGDP, but the number that matters is AGDP—the quantity of money, not the quality of products. If you try to solve the problem of inadequate AGDP inflation by improving the GDP deflator, i.e., by better technology, you are committing cargo cult economics. You are trying to cause a cause with an effect. Is there any problem at all with this insane machine? Sure there is. It’s insane, after all. Its insanity is totally disproportionate to its actual purpose, i.e., employing otherwise idle and useless humans. As we’ll see, a sane regime could accomplish the same goal far more sanely. A financial system is a central planning mechanism. To the extent that a planning mechanism, whether automatic or bureaucratic, is sane, it instructs economic actors to make sane and rational decisions, like investing in productive assets. To the extent that it instructs economic actors to do insane things, like building empty cities in the middle of Mongolia , its automatic and supposedly free-market nature is no different from the bureaucratic insanity of a Gosplan , or the autocratic insanity of a Houphouët-Boigny . Of course, it still fulfills its actual mission of creating jobs. But not without significant and unnecessary financial weirdness, whose only purpose is to pretend that the machine is not in fact a makework scheme. In America, the consequence of job creation through AGDP inflation is the notorious FIRE economy , a central-planning system in which the only income source is asset-price inflation, and the employment created involves Mexican immigrants installing granite countertops and nice white ladies selling real estate to each other. For instance, this is essentially the economy of Ohio, once one of the world’s great industrial centers. As a way for human beings to spend their time, frankly, it seems lame and depressing. Is it that much better than digging ditches with spoons? Moreover, nuclear waste is dangerous. A critical point is passed in an event like that of 2008, which might be described as the transition from debt capitalism to debt communism. Under debt capitalism, it is possible to sustain the illusion that both borrower and lender are private-sector agents. Under debt communism, a state we have now attained, borrowing remains a private action, but the Fed is now and forever the lender of first resort. The bottom line is that in business terms, what’s wrong with the American economy is very simple. It loses money. In order to keep operating on an even keel, it needs to borrow roughly $1.2T a year. In other words, we have a simple way to get 2% AGDP growth per year—expand the debt bomb by 2% a year. We can also inflate the stock and real estate markets, which is better, of course, because equity does not create obligations. It’s a way of enriching the rich at the expense of the poor, but hey, what else is new? A money-losing economy, like a money-losing restaurant, sucks. It sucks in all kinds of ways that have no apparent connection to finance. The entire dining experience is grim. This, indeed, is the experience of the entire “old economy” outside the little bubbles of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. My in-laws live in Columbus. Columbus sucks. Even with Chairman Ben’s $85-billion-a-month bond-buying “recovery.” It is more and more palpably a Soviet restaurant. The fantasy of the money-losing economy, like that of the money-losing restaurant, is that if enough money is pumped in, eventually the “pump will be primed” and the engine will restart on its own. On this theory, America has been expanding its debt bomb since the 1930s. Yo, it’s not working. I’d be happy to bet any sum of money on what would happen if Chairman Ben turned off the QE . If you are into professional betting, bet on zero interest rates for the infinite future. “Capitalism” with zero interest rates is a mockery and a monstrosity—but there is no alternative within the system. Worse, we will face a 2008 all over again when the private sector’s debt becomes so large that even borrowing from an infinite lender is no longer a market operation. Goldman Sachs can borrow at 0%, but you can’t. Debt has to be serviced. Debt saturation happens. When it happens, debt deflation begins—and in a debt-deflation phase, even borrowing at 0% is no longer a market operation. Once debt deflation begins, there is no alternative but reflation by direct government spending, in the classic “ Bernanke helicopter ” mode. While the political system is always capable of helicopter drops in theory, it may not be capable of it in practice. And if it can achieve direct inflation, it has still entered a purely Soviet mode in which all investment is directed by the State. And all this, just so that marginally employable Americans with an IQ of 95 can have jobs. Which many of them can’t. Evaluated as a job creation mechanism, which is what it is, this insane financial inflation machine earns no better than a C–. Granted, it has put us so far behind the debt 8-ball that if you turn it off, you go straight from C– to F–. Which was about to happen in 2008 before Bernanke fired up his helicopter . It’s a trap! And the bait isn’t even that tasty. So are there other solutions? Is there a Solution E? An F? Well, sure. They’re not politically possible. Nothing other than what we’re doing now is politically possible, at least, not without regime change. As Hunter S. Thompson put it , that bothers me the way VD bothers a Hell’s Angel. If not less. E is a factor we left out: foreign trade. As it happens, the US with its disastrous 37% labor-force nonparticipation rate (i.e., the real measurement of “unemployment”, which is commonly cited in terms of the meaningless benefit-claims number), besides borrowing $1.2T a year, runs a trade deficit of $600B a year. I.e., 3% of US GDP. What does this mean? What it means is that if USG entirely eliminated foreign trade , closing its ports like Tokugawa Japan , US businesses would experience an immediate 3% jump in gross revenue, and hence in employment. Of course, this would involve a boom in import substitution industries and a bust in export industries, but the net effect would be a boom. $500B ain’t nothing. The hedonic effect, of course, would be negative—but as we’ve seen, inadequate hedonism is anything but our problem. We could do even better than this. We could eliminate imports, while maintaining exports. Of course, we would be admitting the mercantilist reality of world trade, something our Asian trading “partners” already understand. Does it hurt that much to say: “Friedrich List was right?” Let’s say that retaliation would cut our exports not to zero, but just in half. In that case, we have $0 in imports and $650B in exports, meaning a net gain in revenue to US businesses of roughly $1.2T—and that’s not counting a multiplier effect of money spent o",50000

David Corn Washington, DC, Bureau Chief Bio | Follow Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Bluesky Email Comments From left: Frank Gaffney; Ginni Thomas; Allen West Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters. Believing they are losing the messaging war with progressives, a group of prominent conservatives in Washington—including the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and journalists from Breitbart News and the Washington Examiner— has been meeting privately since early this year to concoct talking points, coordinate messaging, and hatch plans for &#8220;a 30 front war seeking to fundamentally transform the nation,&#8221; according to documents obtained by Mother Jones . Dubbed Groundswell, this coalition convenes weekly in the offices of Judicial Watch, the conservative legal watchdog group. During these hush-hush sessions and through a Google group, the members of Groundswell—including aides to congressional Republicans—cook up battle plans for their ongoing fights against the Obama administration, congressional Democrats, progressive outfits, and the Republican establishment and &#8220;clueless&#8221; GOP congressional leaders. They devise strategies for killing immigration reform, hyping the Benghazi controversy, and countering the impression that the GOP exploits racism. And the Groundswell gang is mounting a behind-the-scenes organized effort to eradicate the outsize influence of GOP über-strategist/pundit Karl Rove within Republican and conservative ranks. (For more on Groundswell&#8217;s &#8220;two front war&#8221; against Rove—a major clash on the right—click here .) One of the influential conservatives guiding the group is Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Thomas, a columnist for the Daily Caller and a tea party consultant and lobbyist. Other Groundswell members include John Bolton, the former UN ambassador; Frank Gaffney, the president of the Center for Security Policy; Ken Blackwell and Jerry Boykin of the Family Research Council; Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch; Gayle Trotter, a fellow at the Independent Women&#8217;s Forum; Catherine Engelbrecht and Anita MonCrief of True the Vote; Allen West, the former GOP House member; Sue Myrick, also a former House GOPer; Diana Banister of the influential Shirley and Banister PR firm ; and Max Pappas, a top aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Among the conveners listed in an invitation to a May 8 meeting of Groundswell were Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News Network; Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who resoundingly lost a Maryland Senate race last year (and is now running for a House seat); Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society; Sandy Rios, a Fox News contributor; Lori Roman, a former executive director of the American Legislative Exchange Council; and Austin Ruse, the head of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute. Conservative journalists and commentators participating in Groundswell have included Breitbart News reporters Matthew Boyle and Mike Flynn, Washington Examiner executive editor Mark Tapscott, and National Review contributor Michael James Barton. Meet the participants in Groundswell Groundswell has collaborated with conservative GOPers on Capitol Hill, including Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Cruz and Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), a leading tea partier. At its weekly meetings, the group aims to strengthen the right&#8217;s messaging by crafting Twitter hashtags; plotting strategy on in-the-headlines issues such as voter ID, immigration reform, and the sequester; promoting politically useful scandals; and developing &#8220;action items.&#8221; A certain amount of secrecy cloaks Groundswell&#8217;s efforts. Though members have been encouraged to zap out tweets with a #GSW hashtag , a message circulated to members of its Google group noted that the role of certain advocates should be kept &#8220;off of the Google group for OPSEC [operational security] reasons.&#8221; This &#8220;will avoid any potential for bad press for someone if a communication item is leaked,&#8221; the message explained. (The Groundswell documents were provided to Mother Jones by a source who had access to its Google group page and who has asked not to be identified.) &#8220;We want to protect the strategic collaboration occurring at Groundswell and build on it. Please be careful about bringing guests and clear them ahead of time.&#8221; Washington is full of coalitions that meet to coordinate messaging and strategy. For two decades, conservative strategist Grover Norquist , who heads Americans for Tax Reform, has held his now-famous Wednesday morning meetings for a broad spectrum of Republicans, including conservatives opposed to gay rights and abortion rights and those who favor them, as well as GOPers on different sides of the immigration reform debate. Groundswell, which meets at the same time as Norquist&#8217;s group, appears to be a more ideologically pure version of the Norquist confab, and its emergence—given the prominent role of Ginni Thomas and the participation of journalists—prompts several intriguing questions. Critics have contended that Thomas&#8217; work as a lobbyist opposing Obamacare posed a conflict of interest for her husband, who would rule on the constitutionality of the health care reform initiative. (Clarence Thomas joined the Supreme Court minority that favored striking down the law.) And Common Cause has maintained that Justice Thomas had a conflict of interest when he participated in the Citizens United case because his wife at the time was running a conservative nonprofit fighting the &#8220;tyranny&#8221; of President Barack Obama that would benefit from removing limits on such groups&#8217; spending and fundraising. With her involvement in Groundswell—which zeroes in on contentious issues that come before the high court, including voting rights, abortion, and gay marriage—Ginni Thomas continues to be intricately associated with matters on which her husband may have to render a decision. Ginni Thomas did not respond to requests for comment. The participation of journalists in coordinating messaging with ideological advocates and political partisans raises another set of issues. Conservatives expressed outrage when news broke in 2009 about Journolist, a private email list where several hundred progressive-minded reporters, commentators, and academics exchanged ideas and sometimes bickered. (I was on Journolist, mainly as a lurker .) The late Andrew Breitbart once offered $100,000 for the full Journolist archives and denounced it as &#8220;the epitome of progressive and liberal collusion that conservatives, Tea Partiers, moderates and many independents have long suspected and feared exists at the heart of contemporary American political journalism.&#8221; The Groundswell documents show conservative journalists, including several with Breitbart News , colluding on high-level messaging with leading partisans of the conservative movement. How Groundswellers Win &#8220;Brownie Points&#8221; Notes prepared after a Groundswell meeting held on March 27 detailed the group&#8217;s mission and origins : Groundswell evolved out of conversations among conservative leaders after the November elections. This is the eighth meeting. Now others are asking to be included. Growth needs to be strategic; it should be made up of senior level people willing to collaborate. It is important to keep a balance of social conservatives, national security conservatives, and constitutional conservatives. Outreach has occurred to incorporate groups with extensive reach: Heritage, Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, AFP [Americans for Prosperity], FRC [Family Research Council] and the NRA, among others…Our country is in peril. This is a critical moment needing critical leadership. We want to protect the strategic collaboration occurring at Groundswell and build on it. Please be careful about bringing guests and clear them ahead of time. The memo declared that the goal was not to merely ponder, but to be proactive: What Groundswell is not is a room of note takers. The goal of Groundswell is to sync messages and develop action from reports and information exchanged. Going forward there should be an action item accompanying each report. At the March 27 meeting , Groundswell participants discussed one multipurpose theme they had been deploying for weeks to bash the president on a variety of fronts, including immigration reform and the sequester: Obama places &#8220;politics over public safety.&#8221; In a display of Groundswell&#8217;s message-syncing, members of the group repeatedly flogged this phrase in public. Frank Gaffney penned a Washington Times op-ed titled &#8220;Putting Politics Over Public Safety.&#8221; Tom Fitton headlined a Judicial Watch weekly update &#8220;Politics over Public Safety: More Illegal Alien Criminals Released by Obama Administration.&#8221; Peter List, editor of LaborUnionReport.com, authored a RedState.com post called &#8220;Obama&#8217;s Machiavellian Sequestration Pain Game: Putting Politics Over Public Safety.&#8221; Matthew Boyle used the phrase in an immigration-related article for Breitbart . And Dan Bongino promoted Boyle&#8217;s story on Twitter by tweeting , &#8220;Politics over public safety?&#8221; In a message to Groundswellers, Ginni Thomas awarded &#8220;brownie points&#8221; to Fitton, Gaffney, and other members for promoting the &#8220;politics over public safety&#8221; riff. &#8220;If we lose on immigration, we lose on every other issue. They key to defeating this bill is Sen. Rubio.&#8221; There was much more on the agenda for the March 27 meeting than a single talking point. The group routinely addresses an ambitious to-do list for its campaign against the left. At that session, Groundswellers discussed several immigration-related &#8220;action items.&#8221; These included attempting to link the pending reform bill to Obamacare and collecting health care reform horror stories to provide to Cruz, a leading opponent of the Senate immigration reform bill. (Cruz has repeatedly compared the legislation to the health care reform law.) Groundswell members saw immigration as a life-or-death issue. &#8220;If we lose on immigration,&#8221; the post-meeting memo noted, &#8220;we lose on every other issue. The key to defeating this bill is Sen. Rubio. He can gracefully remove himself from the &#8216;gang of 8&#8217; and still save face…The messaging on this issue has to be &#8216;we can&#8217;t trust Obama&#8217; to enforce immigration laws after the amnesty.&#8221; The group also reviewed how best to oppose the confirmation of Tom Perez , Obama&#8217;s nominee for labor secretary. Groundswellers claimed that Perez, then a senior Justice Department official, supported &#8220;Muslim Brotherhood organizations and Shariah.&#8221; (One Groundswell memo maintained that Perez &#8220;is extremely antagonistic toward whites.&#8221;) A third agenda item that Wednesday morning was beating back the effort to end the Boy Scouts of America&#8217;s ban on gay Scouts. And there was yet another issue for the Groundswell members to stoke: &#8220;John Kerry has family ties to Iran that opens the doors to blackmail and other national security risks. Kerry&#8217;s son in law is an Iranian American with extensive family still in Iran.&#8221; The post-meeting memo suggested Twitter hashtags to push: #CantTrustObama, #PoliticsOverPublicSafety, #SequesterLies. &#8220;We&#8217;re Failing the Propaganda Battle&#8221; The Groundswellers feel that they too often lose the political narrative to their progressive rivals. One memo that circulated among members declared, &#8220;We must reclaim the language and put &#8216;a face&#8217; on our messages; tell stories. Write articles on 4th grade level!&#8221; A Groundswell memo noted, &#8220;Terms like, &#8216;GOP,&#8217; &#8216;Tea Party,&#8217; &#8216;Conservative&#8217; communicate &#8216;racism.'&#8221; They proposed an alternative: &#8220;Fredrick Douglas Republican.&#8221; Notes from a February 28 Groundswell gathering reflected both their collective sense of pessimism and desire for aggressive tactics: &#8220;We are failing the propaganda battle with minorities. Terms like, &#8216;GOP,&#8217; &#8216;Tea Party,&#8217; &#8216;Conservative&#8217; communicate &#8216;racism.'&#8221; The Groundswellers proposed an alternative: &#8220;Fredrick Douglas Republican,&#8221; a phrase, the memo noted, that &#8220;changes minds.&#8221; (His name is actually spelled &#8220;Frederick Douglass.&#8221;) The meeting notes also stated that an &#8220;active radical left is dedicated to destroy [sic] those who oppose them&#8221; with &#8220;vicious and unprecedented tactics. We are in a real war; most conservatives are not prepared to fight.&#8221; The notes from the March 20 meeting summed up Groundswell griping: &#8220;Conservatives are so busy dealing with issues like immigration, gay marriage and boy scouts there is little time left to focus on other issues. These are the very issues the Left wants to avoid but we need to magnify. R&#8217;s cannot beat Obama at his own game but need to go on the offense and define the issues.&#8221; The group&#8217;s proposed offensive would include hyping the Fast and Furious gun-trafficking controversy, slamming Obama&#8217;s record, and touting Benghazi as a full-fledged scandal. &#8220;The problem,&#8221; the memo noted, &#8220;is Speaker Boehner and [Rep.] Mike Rogers (Intelligence Community) are refusing to deal&#8221; with the Benghazi issue. It added, &#8220;Leaders can and should be shamed into doing the right thing.&#8221; Another problem for right-wingers, this memo pointed out, was that though &#8220;a group of freshmen and sophomore representatives in Congress…are willing and ready to stand up&#8221; for conservative causes, &#8220;no one is willing to step up and become that leader.&#8221; Reflecting the dim view held by Groundswell members of House GOPers, the memo maintained that too many Republican lawmakers were co-opted by power and reluctant to challenge House Republican leaders: &#8220;The Speaker holds the control in the House. He controls committees, chairmanships, meeting rooms, etc. Conservatives sell out rationalizing their compromises will position them to advance their agenda through committee work. In reality they are being bought.&#8221; Boehner, according to his memo, was too frightened to confront Obama head-on regarding budget issues because he &#8220;believes that Newt lost his speakership due to the government shutdown.&#8221; Venting about weak and squishy GOP leaders was a regular feature of Groundswell gatherings. One action item put it bluntly : GAP of REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP: how do we tell them they are failing their base; will lose in 2014 unless they fight for principles (as opposed to show disdain for them and accommodate Obama; O is dividing Rs and they seem clueless: IDEAS NEEDED! A week later, Newt Gingrich was scheduled to address the group on the &#8220;lack of Republican Leadership right now, and Rove.&#8221; For 10 minutes. At the March 27 meeting, Groundswellers once more voiced their anger with the GOP establishment and Rove—ideological sellouts, they believed, who undercut conservative candidates in order to back Republicans deemed more electable. They discussed the efforts among conservatives to respond to the Republican Party&#8217;s recently released autopsy (PDF) of the 2012 elections, which called on the party to be more inclusive of minorities and less severe on social issues. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, the post-meeting memo huffed, &#8220;is sending messages to the party…If we were all gay illegal aliens, the party likes us. He is preparing the way for a change on social issues by giving a warning, &#8216;don&#8217;t go Old Testament&#8217; and advising the party to consider what Rove said about the next nominees could speak favorably of homosexual marriage in the campaign.&#8221; The memo summed up Groundswell&#8217;s preferred solution to GOP woes: &#8220;embrace the libertarian and conservative wing of the party.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m Going to Need Help Pushing Back&#8221; Shortly after its creation, Groundswell started bolstering interactions between right-wing advocates and conservative members of the Senate and the House. On March 5, Gaston Mooney, a staffer for the Senate Republican Steering Committee, posted a message to Groundswell&#8217;s Google group asking for questions that could be posed to Gina McCarthy, Obama&#8217;s nominee to lead the EPA, during confirmation hearings or in meetings between her and individual senators. (She was confirmed as EPA chief this month.) &#8220;If we were all gay illegal aliens, the party likes us. [RNC chair Reince Priebus] is preparing the way for a change on social issues by giving a warning, &#8216;don&#8217;t go Old Testament.'&#8221; At an April 3 meeting , Groundswell members were encouraged to send Paul Teller, executive director of the Republican Study Committee, the caucus of House conservatives, &#8220;feasible asks in exchange for raised debt ceiling.&#8221; The post-meeting memo noted, &#8220;House conservatives want clear consensus on what the conservative grassroots want to see negotiated.&#8221; Here was a chance for Groundswellers to shape the next debt ceiling showdown. In Groundswell&#8217;s first months, one of the most active members in its Google group was Danielle Cutrona, chief counsel to Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. She frequently placed information—speeches, articles, press releases—on Groundswell&#8217;s Google group. In February, she posted opposition research material regarding a judicial appointment and asked members to distribute it: &#8220;Any help is much appreciated.&#8221; In another message to Groundswell, she requested assistance in opposing the pro-immigration reform GOP establishment. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to need help pushing back,&#8221; she wrote. On one occasion , Cutrona promoted a column from the conservative site RedState.com . Headlined &#8220;Who is Going to Put an End to the McCain/Graham Circus?&#8221; this RedState.com post excoriated Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham as &#8220;Benedict Arnolds&#8221; for retreating on their opposition to Chuck Hagel&#8217;s nomination as defense secretary and for &#8220;their treachery on the issue of illegal immigration.&#8221; Cutrona, who occasionally used her official Senate email to communicate with Groundswell members, was encouraging this band of conservatives to spread the word that two party colleagues of her boss were ideological traitors. A spokesman for Sessions says that this blog post did not reflect Cutrona&#8217;s views and &#8220;was simply one of scores of diverse news and opinion pieces she emailed on immigration.&#8221; &#8220;Even If the Idea Isn&#8217;t Perfect, I Can Help Massage It&#8221; Several conservative journalists have enthusiastically participated in Groundswell&#8217;s deliberations. In March, Mark Tapscott, the executive editor of the conservative Washington Examiner , sent his most recent column to group members . It focused on a theme that Groundswellers had resolved to hype: President Obama is a divider. And after a meeting that month, Tapscott wrote to the group , &#8220;Enjoyed hearing from all of you who spoke earlier today. It&#8217;s amazing how much we are accomplishing on so many fronts.&#8221; But Tapscott tells Mother Jones that after attending one or two meetings at the invitation of Ginni Thomas, he decided to stop participating: &#8220;The implication of attending is that you&#8217;re participating in their planning, and, as a journalist, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s appropriate. Other journalists may think differently.&#8221; At another Groundswell gathering, according to the minutes , the members decided to ask Breitbart &#8216;s Stephen Bannon to arrange for his media organization &#8220;to get senators on the record regarding their support [or non-support]&#8221; of the filibuster that GOP Sens. Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz were threatening to mount against the gun control bill. This suggested that the Groundswellers thought they could task Breitbart News to pursue a story that would be strategically useful for the group. ( Breitbart News was already covering the possible filibuster.) &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing how much we are accomplishing on so many fronts,&#8221; the Washington Examiner &#8216;s Mark Tapscott wrote to fellow Groundswell members. Groundswell has forged a particularly close relationship with Breitbart . Matthew Boyle, one of Breitbart &#8216;s more prominent reporters, has attended Groundswell meetings, used the group as a source for tips and a mechanism to promote his stories, and joined in its efforts to whip up coordinated bullet points to be deployed by conservative advocacy shops. In February, he tried to enlist the group to push a story he had written the year before at the Daily Caller , in which he maintained the Justice Department was in cahoots with the liberal group Media Matters to smear conservative whistleblowers and journalists. In a long note addressed to all Groundswellers—written at a time when reporter Bob Woodward was making (what turned out to be inflated) claims about the Obama White House intimidating foes—Boyle said, &#8220;Figured this might be a good time to bring this story back up and see if there&#8217;s a way to drive it.&#8221; Boyle said he was hoping to prompt congressional Republicans to launch an investigation. He contended he had only revealed the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; and shared his suspicion that many government agencies (State, the CIA, the Pentagon, the EPA, and more) were conspiring with &#8220;far left wing groups&#8221; to undermine conservatives in the media: &#8220;I think we can get at the heart of the Obama admin&#8217;s weaknesses here.&#8221; He explained: &#8220;Any evidence obtained would be more proof of collusion between the administration and the media and far left groups, while at the same time serving as evidence of whatever ridiculously moronic big government policies they&#8217;re pushing are.&#8221; The following month, Boyle sent a message to Groundswell members seeking tips and offering to help shape stories Groundswellers wanted to disseminate: &#8220;I&#8217;m saying we can get pieces out fast on Breitbart. Whenever you have an idea, email or call me with a pitch and I&#8217;ll do my best to get the story out there. Keep us on offense, them on defense. Even if the idea isn&#8217;t perfect, I can help massage it to get there.&#8221; A high-priority cause for Groundswellers is voter identification efforts—what progressives would call voter suppression—and when Groundswellers developed a thread on their Google group page exploring the best way to pitch the right&#8217;s voter identification endeavors as a major voting rights case was pending in the Supreme Court, the coalition&#8217;s friendly journalists joined right in. Dan Bongino, the ex-Secret Service agent and 2012 Senate candidate, kicked off the discussion : &#8220;We need to reframe this. This narrative of the Left has already taken hold in MD. The words &#8216;Voter ID&#8217; are already lost &amp; equated with racism. Maybe a &#8216;free and fair elections initiative&#8217; with a heavy emphasis on avoiding ANY voter disenfranchisement combined with an identification requirement which includes a broader range of documents.&#8221; Sheryl Kaufman, communications director for Rep. Jim Bridenstine, chimed in: &#8220;&#8216;OBAMAGRATION&#8217;—I love it!! Communicates the similarity with Obamacare.&#8221; In response, Tapscott suggested, &#8220;How about &#8216;Election Integrity&#8217;?&#8221; And Gaffney weighed in: &#8220;I like it.&#8221; Fitton noted that Judicial Watch had an &#8220;Election Integrity Project.&#8221; Boyle proposed, &#8220;Fair and equal elections,&#8221; explaining, &#8220;Terms &#8216;fair&#8217; and &#8216;equal&#8217; connect with most people. It&#8217;s why the left uses them.&#8221; Then came True the Vote&#8217;s Anita MonCrief: &#8220;We do a lot under the Election Integrity Banner. Does not resonate with the people. Voter Rights may be better. We really have been trying to get the messaging right.&#8221; Minutes later, Breitbart &#8216;s Mike Flynn tried to change the conversation , noting that Boyle earlier in the week had reported that Obama&#8217;s daughters had been vacationing in the Bahamas while the White House had suspended tours due to the sequester. &#8220;The Obama White House has never been so exposed to public criticism as they are right now, because of their decision to cancel WH tours,&#8221; Flynn wrote. &#8220;Everything should be focused on that front.&#8221; He declared, &#8220;We have to be willing to march to the sound of the guns.&#8221; (Earlier in the week, Boyle had posted his story on the Obama daughters on Groundswell&#8217;s Google group page, noting, &#8220;I think this fits in nicely with that politics over public safety theme…Enjoy.&#8221;) Ignoring Flynn&#8217;s missive, Engelbrecht, the president of True the Vote, wrote, &#8220;We bill ourselves as an Election Integrity Initiative and have found it strikes the right tone.&#8221; In a response to a request for comment regarding his participation in Groundswell&#8217;s message-making, Flynn emailed, &#8220;We have reporters covering lots of meetings in DC, as I&#8217;m sure you do as well. As you know, it provides critical background to know what&#8217;s happening on the Hill.&#8221; In a subsequent email, Flynn insisted, &#8220;[N]either Boyle nor I have spent 1 minute on any messaging. We haven&#8217;t spent any time creating talking points.&#8221; Flynn added, &#8220;[W]e are journalists with a point of view. We are open about that. We attend meetings of conservatives. Where we are allowed, we attend meetings of leftist activists.&#8221; Boyle did not respond to requests for comment. &#8220;We All Lament the Difficulty We Have Persuading Americans&#8221; In between the weekly meetings, Groundswellers keep on scheming, frequently using their Google group to share ideas and need-to-know information. The material is often routine: a John Bolton op-ed , a press release opposing the nomination of the EPA administrator, a call to rally support for a Rand Paul filibuster. Often the material reveals the group&#8217;s ideological excesses, such as a PowerPoint supposedly proving that John Brennan, the Obama national security adviser who has become CIA chief, is soft on radical Islam. In one post, Ginni Thomas encouraged Groundswell members to watch Agenda: Grinding America Down , a documentary that claims that progressives (including Obama) seek &#8220;a brave new world&#8221; based on the &#8220;failed policies and ideologies of communism&#8221; and that an evil left is purposefully &#8220;destroying the greatest country in all of world history.&#8221; MonCrief posted an email noting that the bombs that exploded at the Boston Marathon were &#8220;similar to Bill Ayers&#8217; Weather Underground nail bomb.&#8221; But Groundswellers constantly brainstorm via their Google group in search of a magic talking point, or a silver bullet of messaging. On April 24, Keli Carender, the national grassroots coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, posted a message to the Google group, writing, &#8220;We should have a unified name for the immigration bill so that as the other side is calling it &#8216;reform,&#8217; we present a unified front against that notion. If we&#8217;re all calling it different things, their &#8216;reform&#8217; message will win. We only combat the idea that it is reform if we hammer back with one different phrase/name.&#8221; She tossed out a few ideas: &#8220;Schumer-Rubio bill,&#8221; &#8220;anti-security bill,&#8221; and &#8220;amnesty bill.&#8221; Sheryl Kaufman, the communications director for Rep. Jim Bridenstine, chimed in that she was fond of a phrase derived by MonCreif: &#8220;&#8216;OBAMAGRATION&#8217;—I love it!! Communicates the similarity with Obamacare.&#8221; When Campaign for America&#8217;s Future, a progressive group, sent out an email regarding the sequester headlined &#8220;Don&#8217;t let Republicans destroy the economy,&#8221; Carender sent a message to Groundswell members via the Google group: &#8220;What about a &#8216;stick with sequester&#8217; (or similar) mantra from our side?&#8221; Responding to Carender&#8217;s note, Peter List of LaborUnionReport.com wrote, &#8220;Most Americans don&#8217;t understand sequesters. We need to be more clever than the Left on this…Something amusing and easy for LIVs [low-information voters] to understand. Maybe a tie in to Humpty Dumpty (the economy) and all King Obama&#8217;s men (&#8216;tax increases&#8217;) not being able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. (I&#8217;m open to anything…and just made that up.)&#8221; At another point, List emailed Ginni Thomas an idea for an anti-Obama ad that he thought could go viral: A 15 sec internet [YouTube ad] featuring ethnically diverse children on a merry-go-round [soft music]… Nuclear explosion. Two bullet points on the facts. Call to action: Tell President Obama &amp; Congress not to cut our nation&#8217;s defense. Thomas posted the note for all in Groundswell to see. &#8220;Brilliant idea,&#8221; she commented. &#8220;…Taker?&#8221; Several months after Groundswell kicked off, Steven Sutton, vice president of development for the conservative Leadership Institute and a former chief of staff to several House GOPers, proposed a &#8220;strategic message development project&#8221; for the outfit. &#8220;What is needed,&#8221; he wrote , &#8220;is an umbrella thematic message under which each specific issue can be magnified and maximized. For those familiar with it, this is an extension and development of the Leesburg Grid (which the Left has co-opted and now uses extensively, and the Right has ignored and allowed to fall into disuse.)&#8221; Sutton suggested using four main themes: Obama and liberal policies fail; Obama and liberal policies make things worse; there is a lack of leadership in the White House; and Obama &#8220;puts politics ahead of people/our country/America.&#8221; These themes, he contended, &#8220;are best used sequentially, rather than randomly/haphazardly/isolated…The most important thing is to think thematically and drive these messages.&#8221; Sutton went on: Issues matter. Details matter. Substance matters. But theme matters more. Substance matters only as it helps to reinforce the themes. We all lament the difficulty we have persuading Americans. After all, we have the facts, figures, and data to prove our points. Why can&#8217;t we persuade? There are many tactics we can use to help persuade (telling stories, finding victims, tempering tone). But these tactics pale in comparison to the importance of providing a context…a theme…to help people organize their thoughts and opinions. Groundswell has set itself up as the theme lab for the true-red activists of the conservative movement. Fearing that some hydra of the left has long been running wild, vanquishing the right, and bringing the nation closer to utter ruin, the members of Groundswell have birthed a hydra of their own.

Covering the worlds of data security, privacy and hacker culture. Aug 14, 2013, 10:10am EDT Dec 10, 2021, 08:30am EST Share Save This article is more than 10 years old. Palantir chief executive Alex Karp. (Credit: Eric Millette for Forbes) By Andy Greenberg and Ryan Mac Since rumors began to spread that a startup called Palantir helped to kill Osama bin Laden, Alex Karp hasn&#x27;t had much time to himself. On one sun-baked July morning in Silicon Valley Palantir&#x27;s lean 45-year-old chief executive, with a top-heavy mop of frazzled hair, hikes the grassy hills around Stanford University&#x27;s massive satellite antennae known as the Dish, a favorite meditative pastime. But his solitude is disturbed somewhat by &quot;Mike,&quot; an ex-Marine--silent, 6 foot 1, 270 pounds of mostly pectoral muscle--who trails him everywhere he goes. Even on the suburban streets of Palo Alto, steps from Palantir&#x27;s headquarters, the bodyguard lingers a few feet behind. &quot;It puts a massive cramp on your life,&quot; Karp complains, his expression hidden behind large black sunglasses. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing worse for reducing your ability to flirt with someone.&quot; Karp&#x27;s 24/7 security detail is meant to protect him from extremists who have sent him death threats and conspiracy theorists who have called Palantir to rant about the Illuminati. Schizophrenics have stalked Karp outside his office for days at a stretch. &quot;It&#x27;s easy to be the focal point of fantasies,&quot; he says, &quot;if your company is involved in realities like ours.&quot; Palantir lives the realities of its customers: the NSA, the FBI and the CIA--an early investor through its In-Q-Tel venture fund--along with an alphabet soup of other U.S. counterterrorism and military agencies. In the last five years Palantir has become the go-to company for mining massive data sets for intelligence and law enforcement applications, with a slick software interface and coders who parachute into clients&#x27; headquarters to customize its programs. Palantir turns messy swamps of information into intuitively visualized maps, histograms and link charts. Give its so-called &quot;forward-deployed engineers&quot; a few days to crawl, tag and integrate every scrap of a customer&#x27;s data, and Palantir can elucidate problems as disparate as terrorism, disaster response and human trafficking. Palantir&#x27;s advisors include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet, who says in an interview that &quot;I wish we had a tool of its power&quot; before 9/11. General David Petraeus, the most recent former CIA chief, describes Palantir to FORBES as &quot;a better mousetrap when a better mousetrap was needed&quot; and calls Karp &quot;sheer brilliant.&quot; Among those using Palantir to connect the dots are the Marines, who have deployed its tools in Afghanistan for forensic analysis of roadside bombs and predicting insurgent attacks. The software helped locate Mexican drug cartel members who murdered an American customs agent and tracked down hackers who installed spyware on the computer of the Dalai Lama. In the book The Finish , detailing the killing of Osama bin Laden, author Mark Bowden writes that Palantir&#x27;s software &quot;actually deserves the popular designation Killer App.&quot; And now Palantir is emerging from the shadow world of spies and special ops to take corporate America by storm. The same tools that can predict ambushes in Iraq are helping pharmaceutical firms analyze drug data. According to a former JPMorgan Chase staffer, they&#x27;ve saved the firm hundreds of millions of dollars by addressing issues from cyberfraud to distressed mortgages. A Palantir user at a bank can, in seconds, see connections between a Nigerian Internet protocol address, a proxy server somewhere within the U.S. and payments flowing out from a hijacked home equity line of credit, just as military customers piece together fingerprints on artillery shell fragments, location data, anonymous tips and social media to track down Afghani bombmakers. Those tools have allowed Palantir&#x27;s T-shirted twentysomethings to woo customers away from the suits and ties of IBM, Booz Allen and Lockheed Martin with a product that deploys faster, offers cleaner results and often costs less than $1 million per installation--a fraction of the price its rivals can offer. Its commercial clients--whose identities it guards even more closely than those of its government customers--include Bank of America and News Corp. Private-sector deals now account for close to 60% of the company&#x27;s revenue, which FORBES estimates will hit $450 million this year, up from less than $300 million last year. Karp projects Palantir will sign a billion dollars in new, long-term contracts in 2014, a year that may also bring the company its first profits. The bottom line: A CIA-funded firm run by an eccentric philosopher has become one of the most valuable private companies in tech, priced at between $5 billion and $8 billion in a round of funding the company is currently pursuing. Karp owns roughly a tenth of the firm--just less than its largest stakeholder, Peter Thiel, the PayPal and Facebook billionaire. (Other billionaire investors include Ken Langone and hedge fund titan Stanley Druckenmiller.) That puts Karp on course to become Silicon Valley&#x27;s latest billionaire--and Thiel could double his fortune--if the company goes public, a possibility Karp says Palantir is reluctantly considering. The biggest problem for Palantir&#x27;s business may be just how well its software works: It helps its customers see too much. In the wake of NSA leaker Edward Snowden&#x27;s revelations of the agency&#x27;s mass surveillance, Palantir&#x27;s tools have come to represent privacy advocates&#x27; greatest fears of data-mining technology -- Google-level engineering applied directly to government spying. That combination of Big Brother and Big Data has come into focus just as Palantir is emerging as one of the fastest-growing startups in the Valley, threatening to contaminate its first public impressions and render the firm toxic in the eyes of customers and investors just when it needs them most. &quot;They&#x27;re in a scary business,&quot; says Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Lee Tien. ACLU analyst Jay Stanley has written that Palantir&#x27;s software could enable a &quot;true totalitarian nightmare, monitoring the activities of innocent Americans on a mass scale.&quot; Karp, a social theory Ph.D., doesn&#x27;t dodge those concerns. He sees Palantir as the company that can rewrite the rules of the zero-sum game of privacy and security. &quot;I didn&#x27;t sign up for the government to know when I smoke a joint or have an affair,&quot; he acknowledges. In a company address he stated, &quot;We have to find places that we protect away from government so that we can all be the unique and interesting and, in my case, somewhat deviant people we&#x27;d like to be.&quot; Karp with billionaire co-founder Peter Thiel at the Sun Valley conference in 2009. &quot;No one was doing ... [+] anything like Palantir,” says Thiel, who believed from the beginning “it was going to be as valuable as Facebook.” (Credit: Allen &amp; Co.) Palantir boasts of technical safeguards for privacy that go well beyond the legal requirements for most of its customers, as well as a team of &quot;privacy and civil liberties engineers.&quot; But it&#x27;s Karp himself who ultimately decides the company&#x27;s path. &quot;He&#x27;s our conscience,&quot; says senior engineer Ari Gesher. The question looms, however, of whether business realities and competition will corrupt those warm and fuzzy ideals. When it comes to talking about industry rivals, Karp often sounds less like Palantir&#x27;s conscience than its id. He expressed his primary motivation in his July company address: to &quot;kill or maim&quot; competitors like IBM and Booz Allen. &quot;I think of it like survival,&quot; he said. &quot;We beat the lame competition before they kill us.&quot; *** KARP SEEMS TO enjoy listing reasons he isn&#x27;t qualified for his job. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have a technical degree, he doesn&#x27;t have any cultural affiliation with the government or commercial areas, his parents are hippies,&quot; he says, manically pacing around his office as he describes himself in the third person. &quot;How could it be the case that this person is cofounder and CEO since 2005 and the company still exists?&quot; The answer dates back to Karp&#x27;s decades-long friendship with Peter Thiel, starting at Stanford Law School. The two both lived in the no-frills Crothers dorm and shared most of their classes during their first year, but held starkly opposite political views. Karp had grown up in Philadelphia, the son of an artist and a pediatrician who spent many of their weekends taking him to protests for labor rights and against &quot;anything Reagan did,&quot; he recalls. Thiel had already founded the staunchly libertarian Stanford Review during his time at the university as an undergrad. &quot;We would run into each other and go at it ... like wild animals on the same path,&quot; Karp says. &quot;Basically I loved sparring with him.&quot; With no desire to practice law, Karp went on to study under Jurgen Habermas, one of the 20th century&#x27;s most prominent philosophers, at the University of Frankfurt. Not long after obtaining his doctorate, he received an inheritance from his grandfather, and began investing it in startups and stocks with surprising success. Some high-net-worth individuals heard that &quot;this crazy dude was good at investing&quot; and began to seek his services, he says. To manage their money he set up the London-based Caedmon Group, a reference to Karp&#x27;s middle name, the same as the first known English-language poet. Back in Silicon Valley Thiel had cofounded PayPal and sold it to eBay in October 2002 for $1.5 billion. He went on to create a hedge fund called Clarium Capital but continued to found new companies: One would become Palantir, named by Thiel for the Palantiri seeing stones from J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Lord of the Rings, orbs that allow the holder to gaze across vast distances to track friends and foes. In a post-9/11 world Thiel wanted to sell those Palantiri-like powers to the growing national security complex: His concept for Palantir was to use the fraud-recognition software designed for PayPal to stop terrorist attacks. But from the beginning the libertarian saw Palantir as an antidote to--not a tool for--privacy violations in a society slipping into a vise of security. &quot;It was a mission-oriented company,&quot; says Thiel, who has personally invested $40 million in Palantir and today serves as its chairman. &quot;I defined the problem as needing to reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties.&quot; In 2004 Thiel teamed up with Joe Lonsdale and Stephen Cohen, two Stanford computer science grads, and PayPal engineer Nathan Gettings to code together a rough product. Initially they were bankrolled entirely by Thiel, and the young team struggled to get investors or potential customers to take them seriously. &quot;How the hell do you get them to listen to 22-year-olds?&quot; says Lonsdale. &quot;We wanted someone to have a little more gray hair.&quot; Enter Karp, whose Krameresque brown curls, European wealth connections and Ph.D. masked his business inexperience. Despite his nonexistent tech background, the founders were struck by his ability to immediately grasp complex problems and translate them to nonengineers. Lonsdale and Cohen quickly asked him to become acting CEO, and as they interviewed other candidates for the permanent job, none of the starched-collar Washington types or M.B.A.s they met impressed them. &quot;They were asking questions about our diagnostic of the total available market,&quot; says Karp, disdaining the B-school lingo. &quot;We were talking about building the most important company in the world.&quot; While Karp attracted some early European angel investors, American venture capitalists seemed allergic to the company. According to Karp, Sequoia Chairman Michael Moritz doodled through an entire meeting. A Kleiner Perkins exec lectured the Palantir founders on the inevitable failure of their company for an hour and a half. Palantir was rescued by a referral to In-Q-Tel, the CIA&#x27;s venture arm, which would make two rounds of investment totaling more than $2 million. ( See our sidebar on In-Q-Tel&#x27;s greatest hits. ) &quot;They were clearly top-tier talent,&quot; says former In-Q-Tel executive Harsh Patel. &quot;The most impressive thing about the team was how focused they were on the problem ... how humans would talk with data.&quot; Karp in Palantir&#x27;s Palo Alto offices. (Credit: Eric Millette for Forbes) That mission turned out to be vastly more difficult than any of the founders had imagined. PayPal had started with perfectly structured and organized information for its fraud analysis. Intelligence customers, by contrast, had mismatched collections of e-mails, recordings and spreadsheets. To fulfill its privacy and security promises, Palantir needed to catalog and tag customers&#x27; data to ensure that only users with the right credentials could access it. This need-to-know system meant classified information couldn&#x27;t be seen by those without proper clearances--and was also designed to prevent the misuse of sensitive personal data. But Palantir&#x27;s central privacy and security protection would be what Karp calls, with his academic&#x27;s love of jargon, &quot;the immutable log.&quot; Everything a user does in Palantir creates a trail that can be audited. No Russian spy, jealous husband or Edward Snowden can use the tool&#x27;s abilities without leaving an indelible record of his or her actions. From 2005 to 2008 the CIA was Palantir&#x27;s patron and only customer, alpha-testing and evaluating its software. But with Langley&#x27;s imprimatur, word of Palantir&#x27;s growing abilities spread, and the motley Californians began to bring in deals and recruits. The philosopher Karp turned out to have a unique ability to recognize and seduce star engineers. His colleagues were so flummoxed by his nose for technical talent that they once sent a pair of underwhelming applicants into a final interview with Karp as a test. He smelled both out immediately. A unique Palantir culture began to form in Karp&#x27;s iconoclast image. Its Palo Alto headquarters, which it calls &quot;the Shire&quot; in reference to the homeland of Tolkien&#x27;s hobbits, features a conference room turned giant plastic ball pit and has floors littered with Nerf darts and dog hair. (Canines are welcome.) Staffers, most of whom choose to wear Palantir-branded apparel daily, spend so much time at the office that some leave their toothbrushes by the bathroom sinks. Karp himself remains the most eccentric of Palantir&#x27;s eccentrics. The lifelong bachelor, who says that the notion of settling down and raising a family gives him &quot;hives,&quot; is known for his obsessive personality: He solves Rubik&#x27;s cubes in less than three minutes, swims and practices the meditative art of Qigong daily and has gone through aikido and jujitsu phases that involved putting cofounders in holds in the Shire&#x27;s hallways. A cabinet in his office is stocked with vitamins, 20 pairs of identical swimming goggles and hand sanitizer. And he addresses his staff using an internal video channel called KarpTube, speaking on wide-ranging subjects like greed, integrity and Marxism. &quot;The only time I&#x27;m not thinking about Palantir,&quot; he says, &quot;is when I&#x27;m swimming, practicing Qigong or during sexual activity.&quot; In 2010 Palantir&#x27;s customers at the New York Police Department referred the company to JPMorgan, which would become its first commercial customer. A team of engineers rented a Tribeca loft, sleeping in bunk beds and working around the clock to help untangle the bank&#x27;s fraud problems. Soon they were given the task of unwinding its toxic mortgage portfolio. Today Palantir&#x27;s New York operation has expanded to a full, Batman-themed office known as Gotham, and its lucrative financial-services practice includes everything from predicting foreclosures to battling Chinese hackers. As its customer base grew, however, cracks began to show in Palantir&#x27;s idealistic culture. In early 2011 e-mails emerged that showed a Palantir engineer had collaborated on a proposal to deal with a WikiLeaks threat to spill documents from Bank of America. The Palantir staffer had eagerly agreed in the e-mails to propose tracking and identifying the group&#x27;s donors, launching cyberattacks on WikiLeaks&#x27; infrastructure and even threatening its sympathizers. When the scandal broke, Karp put the offending engineer on leave and issued a statement personally apologizing and pledging the company&#x27;s support of &quot;progressive values and causes.&quot; Outside counsel was retained to review the firm&#x27;s actions and policies and, after some deliberation, determined it was acceptable to rehire the offending employee, much to the scorn of the company&#x27;s critics. Following the WikiLeaks incident, Palantir&#x27;s privacy and civil liberties team created an ethics hotline for engineers called the Batphone: Any engineer can use it to anonymously report to Palantir&#x27;s directors work on behalf of a customer they consider unethical. As the result of one Batphone communication, for instance, the company backed out of a job that involved analyzing information on public Facebook pages. Karp has also stated that Palantir turned down a chance to work with a tobacco firm, and overall the company walks away from as much as 20% of its possible revenue for ethical reasons. (It remains to be seen whether the company will be so picky if it becomes accountable to public shareholders and the demand for quarterly results.) Still, according to former employees, Palantir has explored work in Saudi Arabia despite the staff&#x27;s misgivings about human rights abuses in the kingdom. And for all Karp&#x27;s emphasis on values, his apology for the WikiLeaks affair also doesn&#x27;t seem to have left much of an impression in his memory. In his address to Palantir engineers in July he sounded defiant: &quot;We&#x27;ve never had a scandal that was really our fault.&quot; *** AT 4:07 P.M. ON NOV. 14, 2009 Michael Katz-Lacabe was parking his red Toyota Prius in the driveway of his home in the quiet Oakland suburb of San Leandro when a police car drove past. A license plate camera mounted on the squad car silently and routinely snapped a photo of the scene: his off-white, single-floor house, his wilted lawn and rosebushes, and his 5- and 8-year-old daughters jumping out of the car. Katz-Lacabe, a gray-bearded and shaggy-haired member of the local school board, community activist and blogger, saw the photo only a year later: In 2010 he learned about the San Leandro Police Department&#x27;s automatic license plate readers, designed to constantly photograph and track the movements of every car in the city. He filed a public records request for any images that included either of his two cars. The police sent back 112 photos. He found the one of his children most disturbing. &quot;Who knows how many other people&#x27;s kids are captured in these images?&quot; he asks. His concerns go beyond a mere sense of parental protection. &quot;With this technology you can wind back the clock and see where everyone is, if they were parked at the house of someone other than their wife, a medical marijuana clinic, a Planned Parenthood center, a protest.&quot; San Leandro, Calif. community activist Michael Katz-Lacabe has taken a stand against cops using ... [+] Palantir to analyze license plate photos of millions of unsuspecting drivers. (Credit: Eric Millette for Forbes) As Katz-Lacabe dug deeper, he found that the millions of pictures collected by San Leandro&#x27;s license plate cameras are now passed on to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC), one of 72 federally run intelligence fusion organizations set up after 9/11. That&#x27;s where the photos are analyzed using software built by a company just across San Francisco Bay: Palantir. In the business proposal that Palantir sent NCRIC, it offered customer references that included the Los Angeles and New York police departments, boasting that it enabled searches of the NYPD&#x27;s 500 million plate photos in less than five seconds. Katz-Lacabe contacted Palantir about his privacy concerns, and the company responded by inviting him to its headquarters for a sit-down meeting. When he arrived at the Shire, a pair of employees gave him an hourlong presentation on Palantir&#x27;s vaunted safeguards: its access controls, immutable logs and the Batphone. Katz-Lacabe wasn&#x27;t impressed. Palantir&#x27;s software, he points out, has no default time limits--all information remains searchable for as long as it&#x27;s stored on the customer&#x27;s servers. And its auditing function? &quot;I don&#x27;t think it means a damn thing,&quot; he says. &quot;Logs aren&#x27;t useful unless someone is looking at them.&quot; When Karp hears Katz-Lacabe&#x27;s story, he quickly parries: Palantir&#x27;s software saves lives. &quot;Here&#x27;s an actual use case,&quot; he says and launches into the story of a pedophile driving a &quot;beat-up Cadillac&quot; who was arrested within an hour of assaulting a child, thanks to NYPD license plate cameras. &quot;Because of the license-plate-reader data they gathered in our product, they pulled him off the street and saved human children lives.&quot; &quot;If we as a democratic society believe that license plates in public trigger Fourth Amendment protections, our product can make sure you can&#x27;t cross that line,&quot; he says, adding that there should be time limits on retaining such data. Until the law changes, though, Palantir will play within those rules. &quot;In the real world where we work--which is never perfect--you have to have trade-offs.&quot; And what if Palantir&#x27;s audit logs--its central safeguard against abuse--are simply ignored? Karp responds that the logs are intended to be read by a third party. In the case of government agencies, he suggests an oversight body that reviews all surveillance--an institution that is purely theoretical at the moment. &quot;Something like this will exist,&quot; Karp insists. &quot;Societies will build it, precisely because the alternative is letting terrorism happen or losing all our liberties.&quot; Palantir&#x27;s critics, unsurprisingly, aren&#x27;t reassured by Karp&#x27;s hypothetical court. Electronic Privacy Information Center activist Amie Stepanovich calls Palantir &quot;naive&quot; to expect the government to start policing its own use of technology. The Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s Lee Tien derides Karp&#x27;s argument that privacy safeguards can be added to surveillance systems after the fact. &quot;You should think about what to do with the toxic waste while you&#x27;re building the nuclear power plant,&quot; he argues, &quot;not some day in the future.&quot; Some former Palantir staffers say they felt equally concerned about the potential rights violations their work enabled. &quot;You&#x27;re building something that could absolutely be used for malice. It would have been a nightmare if J. Edgar Hoover had these capabilities in his crusade against Martin Luther King,&quot; says one former engineer. &quot;One thing that really troubled me was the concern that something I contribute to could prevent an Arab Spring-style revolution.&quot; Despite Palantir&#x27;s lofty principles, says another former engineer, its day-to-day priorities are satisfying its police and intelligence customers: &quot;Keeping good relations with law enforcement and &#x27;keeping the lights on&#x27; bifurcate from the ideals.&quot; He goes on to argue that even Palantir&#x27;s founders don&#x27;t quite understand the Palantiri seeing stones in The Lord of the Rings . Tolkien&#x27;s orbs, he points out, didn&#x27;t actually give their holders honest insights. &quot;The Palantiri distort the truth,&quot; he says. And those who look into them, he adds, &quot;only see what they want to see.&quot; *** DESPITE WHAT any critic says, it&#x27;s clear that Alex Karp does indeed value privacy--his own. His office, decorated with cardboard effigies of himself built by Palantir staff and a Lego fortress on a coffee table, overlooks Palo Alto&#x27;s Alma Street through two-way mirrors. Each pane is fitted with a wired device resembling a white hockey puck. The gadgets, known as acoustic transducers, imperceptibly vibrate the glass with white noise to prevent eavesdropping techniques, such as bouncing lasers off windows to listen to conversations inside. He&#x27;s reminiscing about a more carefree time in his life--years before Palantir--and has put down his Rubik&#x27;s cube to better gesticulate. &quot;I had $40,000 in the bank, and no one knew who I was. I loved it. I loved it. I just loved it. I just loved it!&quot; he says, his voice rising and his hands waving above his head. &quot;I would walk around, go into skanky places in Berlin all night. I&#x27;d talk to whoever would talk to me, occasionally go home with people, as often as I could. I went to places where people were doing things, smoking things. I just loved it.&quot; &quot;One of the things I find really hard and view as a massive drag ... is that I&#x27;m losing my ability to be completely anonymous.&quot; It&#x27;s not easy for a man in Karp&#x27;s position to be a deviant in the modern world. And with tools like Palantir in the hands of the government, deviance may not be easy for the rest of us, either. With or without safeguards, the &quot;complete anonymity&quot; Karp savors may be a 20th-century luxury. Karp lowers his arms, and the enthusiasm drains from his voice: &quot;I have to get over this.&quot; __ Follow Ryan Mac on Twitter .

You can also download a PDF of “Technology, communism and the Brown Scare.” Technology, communism and the Brown Scare MENCIUS MOLDBUG · SEPTEMBER 13, 2013 Technology, communism&lt;br&gt; and the Brown Scare It’s with mixed emotions that I see the Brown Scare starting to really rise up and kick ass in my own dear field of hackerdom. “The enemy at last in view , huge and hateful, all disguise cast off…” Brown Scare? Or dare I say… #BrownScare? But what else to name America’s ginormous, never-ending, profoundly insane witch-hunt for fascists under the bed? For there’s nothing new here. At the height of the lame, doomed “ Red Scare ,” the Brown Scare was ten times bigger. You may think it was difficult making a living as a communist screenwriter in 1954. It was a lot easier than being a fascist screenwriter. Or even an anticommunist screenwriter. (Same thing, right?) And as any pathetic last shreds of real opposition shrink and die off, the Scare only grows. That’s how winners play it. That’s just how the permanent revolution rolls. Not that valiant philosophical efforts haven’t been made, such as “ Speech And Consequences ” by Popehat , to distinguish between witch hunts and witch hunts. Apparently Popehat, 1 though he claims to be some sort of a legal scholar and definitely has strong and (more unusually) sincere opinions about free speech, has never heard of Red Channels or Faulk v. AWARE . It’s not clear whether he (a) thinks the Hollywood blacklist was a fine idea, (b) believes it was enforced by the FBI, or (c) considers it laudable to purge fascists but horrible to purge communists. (Update: with eerie, beautiful historical fidelity, Anil Dash channels Red Channels : There was also a pretty dogged pitch for his film, which will get all kinds of warm huzzahs from the intersection of atheists, pacifists, communists and Jews. I was pretty amazed that he went for it. He flat out said that he wants his film to be funded and wasn’t sure if it’d be possible after all of his, and I replied that it realistically wasn’t going to happen without the say-so of someone like me, and I wasn’t inclined to give some producer the nod on this. On reflection, I’ll be explicit: If you’re a producer, and you invest in Dalton Trumbo’s film without a profound, meaningful and years-long demonstration of responsibility from Dalton beforehand, you’re complicit in extending the film industry’s awful track record of communism, and it’s unacceptable. It is also wonderful to see the enormous cognitive load which besets the liberal mind when asked to decide whether it’s the overdog or the underdog. All the CPUs max out, the fan goes crazy and the case could cook an egg. The whole post is worth reading—in the author’s own humble words, it’s the very image of “positive, ambitious, thoughtful, inclusive, curious, empathetic and self-aware.”) Memo to Popehat: most of what we call “McCarthyism” was a matter of “social consequences.” Besides, the social consequences work for one and only one reason: there’s an iron fist in the velvet glove. Being sued for disrespecting a privileged class—excuse me, a protected class—is not in any way a social consequence, but rather a political one. Hey, while we’re chatting, could you remind me exactly how Warren Court jurisprudence derived the “protected class” from “equal protection of law?” I know the theory, actually—but it’d be fun to see you explain it. Of course, ain’t nothin’ new here. For quite some time in America it’s been illegal to employ racists, sexists and fascists, and mandatory to employ a precisely calibrated percentage of women, workers and peasants. Because America is a free country and that’s what freedom means . But “technology,” defined broadly as anything new and cool that happens in California, has been in practice exempt from these restrictions. The elite, especially a productive elite, always enjoys a special level of tolerance. I once asked a Googler: which population, from his unscientific experience alone, does Google employ more of? African-Americans, or Serbs? “You must be joking,” he said. Google, of course, claims the fact that it would rather hire out of East Bosnia than East Palo Alto is a competitive trade secret . Well, I suppose. Curiously enough, Apple, Yahoo, and Oracle share the same secret . Ha, ha! Is it a secret to you? It’s not a secret to me! You know, Goog, once you start lying, there’s really no end to it. For one thing, even if your enemies ignore lying, defensive evasion, and other telltale “beta” behaviors, they still own you. They’ve just decided not to eat you just yet, maybe in the hopes that you’re still getting fatter. So in a way I actually like to see the #BrownScare getting big in Silicon Valley, because I think there’s a lot of potential for opposing it here. A lot of wasted potential. Which will probably remain wasted, but why not try, eh? Dear fellow geeks, there’s no need to get purged. Your predator, though powerful, is not complicated, and not that hard to hack if you’re careful. Indeed, properly organized, you may even be able to overcome him. It’s actually not hard to explain the Brown Scare. Like all witch hunts, it’s built on a conspiracy theory . The Red Scare was based on a conspiracy theory too, but at least it was a real conspiracy with real witches—two of whom were my father’s parents. (The nicest people on earth, as people. I like to think of them not as worshipping Stalin, but worshipping what they thought Stalin was.) Moreover, the Red Scare was a largely demotic or peasant phenomenon to which America’s governing intellectual classes were, for obvious reasons, immune. Because power works and culture is downstream from politics —real politics, at least—the Red Scare soon faded into a joke. As a mainstream conspiracy theory , fully in the institutional saddle, the Brown Scare is far greater and more terrifying. Unfortunately no central statistics are kept, but I wouldn’t be surprised if every day in America, more racists, fascists and sexists are detected, purged and destroyed, than all the screenwriters who had to prosper under pseudonyms in the ’50s. Indeed it’s not an exaggeration to say that hundreds of thousands of Americans, perhaps even a million, are employed in one arm or another of this ideological apparatus. Cleaning it up will require a genuine cultural revolution—or a cultural reaction, anyway. Hey, Americans, I’m ready whenever you are. The logic of the witch hunter is simple. It has hardly changed since Matthew Hopkins ’ day. The first requirement is to invert the reality of power . Power at its most basic level is the power to harm or destroy other human beings. The obvious reality is that witch hunters gang up and destroy witches. Whereas witches are never, ever seen to gang up and destroy witch hunters. By this test alone, we can see that the conspiracy is imaginary (Brown Scare) rather than real (Red Scare). Think about it. Obviously, if the witches had any power whatsoever, they wouldn’t waste their time gallivanting around on broomsticks, fellating Satan and cursing cows with sour milk. They’re getting burned right and left, for Christ’s sake! Priorities! No, they’d turn the tables and lay some serious voodoo on the witch-hunters. In a country where anyone who speaks out against the witches is soon found dangling by his heels from an oak at midnight with his head shrunk to the size of a baseball , we won’t see a lot of witch-hunting and we know there’s a serious witch problem. In a country where witch-hunting is a stable and lucrative career, and also an amateur pastime enjoyed by millions of hobbyists on the weekend, we know there are no real witches worth a damn. We do not see Pax Dickinson and Paul Graham ganging up to destroy Gawker . 2 We see them curling up into a fetal position and trying to survive. An America in which hackers could purge journalists for communist deviation, rather than journalists purging hackers for fascist deviation, would be a very different America. Ya think? Whereas the real America, the America in which a journalist little more than an intern , with no discernible achievements but a sharp tongue, a Columbia degree and trouble using MySQL , can quite effectively bully one of the most accomplished hackers of his era, not to mention a way better writer —this is the remarkable America that we live in and need to explain. This phenomenon of spoiled children systematically bullying their elders and betters reminds us, of course, of Mao . But still more, of Plato. Do they still read Plato at Columbia? Ha, that’s very funny. Plato! Gawker may not know Plato, but Plato knows Gawker : Yes, he said; that is the way with him. Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a turn at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once more living the life of a philosopher; often he is busy with politics, and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head; and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that direction, or of men of business, once more in that. His life has neither law nor order; and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom; and so he goes on. Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality. Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many; he answers to the State which we described as fair and spangled. And many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern, and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him. Just so. Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called the democratic man. Let that be his place, he said. Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, tyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider. Quite true, he said. Say then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise? That it has a democratic origin is evident. Clearly. And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy—I mean, after a sort? How? The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth—am I not right? Yes. And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy? True. And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution? What good? Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the glory of the State—and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell. Yes; the saying is in everybody’s mouth. I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which occasions a demand for tyranny. How so? When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they are cursed oligarchs. Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence. Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are like rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her own heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now, in such a State, can liberty have any limit? Certainly not. By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them. How do you mean? I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is his freedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either. Yes, he said, that is the way. And these are not the only evils, I said—there are several lesser ones: In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars, and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are all alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready to compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners of the young. Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips? That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who does not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as good as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them: and all things are just ready to burst with liberty. When I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you describe. You and I have dreamed the same thing. And above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive the citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws, written or unwritten; they will have no one over them. Yes, he said, I know it too well. Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny. Glorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step? The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy—the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government. Or so we can only hope. I have a bad feeling Plato may be too optimistic here, however. In any case, from Plato’s dialogue we see how the witch-hunter can invert the reality of power and presents himself as the underdog , fighting back against the gigantic and all-encompassing conspiracy of witches. This fantasy is expertly constructed and appears quite real to the casual observer. The primary technique is to present the natural order of human society, which the revolution has in fact totally overthrown—an order in which the young respect the old, the inexperienced follow the accomplished, and dogs obey their owners—as the existing order. The professional witch-hunter, who is in fact a petty bureaucrat, a tool of power and a bully for hire, appears to himself as a sort of daring rebel against the great conspiracy. Moreover, because this natural order both used to exist, and is always striving to spring up against Horace’s pitchfork , it can be portrayed as the ruling order with great fictional nuance and detail—even after a half-century plus of permanent revolution. Furthermore, if you can present a natural force as a human force, it is possible to attribute almost infinite power to the witch conspiracy. Jews, for example, cause droughts. It’s easy to see how strong the Jews are—it hasn’t rained for a month! Throw the Jews down the well! In this particular case, it’s an observation only slightly more obvious than that the sky is blue—especially for those of us who are grownups not born in the 1990s, with, like, wives and daughters and stuff—that (a) geeks are born not made, and (b) a Y chromosome is a major risk factor for geekiness. In other words, we are not equalists . We’d certainly love it if everyone was equal (hopefully leveling up, not leveling down). But we’re not insane and don’t argue with reality. For example, I’m a geek and I’d love it if my daughter was a geek too. She isn’t. Not only is she more girly than me, she’s more girly than her mother (who has an EE degree). She’s reading Lemony Snicket in kindergarten, but she’s not a geek. A friend of mine has a daughter, about the same age, about as smart, who is a geek. I wish my daughter cared about numbers, planets and dinosaurs. For all I know, my friend wishes his daughter was a walking Disney Princess encyclopedia whose dolls can improvise an hour-long soap opera. We can wish all we want, but that’s just not how it is . If I tried to impose my ideal daughter on the real person who reality decided would be my daughter, I would be a bad person and a bad parent. And that’s why I’m a realist, not an equalist. When the witchfinder can attribute the consequences of meteorology, biology, or any other department of reality to a human conspiracy, there is no limit to the proto-divine authority which the witch-cabal then assumes. To rebel against it seems almost as daring and hopeless as a rebellion against God himself . How romantic! How empowering! Smash the great conspiracy of differentness, without which we would all be gloriously the same! Throw the Jews down the well! A great technique. But like all propaganda methods, it wears off. Most people, most of the time, especially in an old worn-out post-democracy like our own, are extremely tired of politics, political philosophy, conspiracy theories, and the like. It’s not exactly that they disagree with the party line. But it no longer excites them. It still excites a ruling minority, of course, and quite vociferously indeed. (The Gawker comment threads, like those of every other party-line board, are full of amateur bullies who derive great apparent pleasure, if not profit, from piling on.) What the bully needs is to provoke mild approval, from the vast majority of ordinary, decent people who don’t care about politics or power and are really not involved with the game at all. It’s this abuse of common decency that offends me most about the witch-hunting process. The ordinary observer does not, really, believe in witches—or disbelieve in them, either. Rhetoric about black cats, third nipples and secret meetings with Satan doesn’t make much impression on her at all. But what she knows is that Goody Hannah is a strange, mean old lady with no husband and a snippy tongue, who smells funny and sleeps way too late in the morning, and once yelled at her when she was a little girl. Left to her own devices, our decent observer would never think of reasoning from this to the proposition that Goody Hannah needs to be drowned. On the other hand, when the crowd (consisting mostly of decent observers) is about to drown Goody Hannah, she’s not exactly about to speak up and stick out her neck. For a strange, mean old lady with no husband and a snippy tongue? That no one speaks up, of course, is no more and no less than the witchfinders need. Clearly, everyone should be nice and no one should have a snippy tongue. We often hear the word offensive . What is an offensive person? In a word, an asshole. Everyone who hears this word (including Popehat—especially Popehat) should stop and think: is it illegal to be an asshole? If so, why should it be illegal to be an asshole? If not, why should it not be illegal to be an asshole? Curiously, two thousand years before anyone had even heard of a “ microaggression ,” a bunch of old white guys called “the Romans” considered this issue and concluded : de minimis non curat lex . Literally: “the law does not concern itself with trifles.” Or metaphorically: no. No, it is not, and should not be, illegal to be an asshole. Think about the logic of a world in which it’s illegal to be an asshole. Or at least, in which one is liable for being an asshole. Anyone could sue anyone else, at any time, for being an asshole. In this world, “ you dick ” 3 isn’t an insult. It’s a tort . It’s a factual claim that, if proven true by a court of law , pays damages . Of course, we know the Romans were a bunch of ignorant heteronormative dicks. The Greeks, too! Plato, Socrates, Aristotle… morons! Ah, how far we’ve come. But really, why shouldn’t Spicoli be able to sue Mr. Hand? Who really was a dick, wasn’t he? Why should anyone be allowed to be a dick? Why should that be okay, in our tolerant society? To be a dick? A legal system in which insolence is a tort has never, so far as I know, been tried. In general, sages and jurists for all the world and time have agreed that, though it is not nice for people to be not nice to each other, the desirable goal of enforcing universal sweetness and niceness is simply not one within the reach of human jurisprudence. For one thing, the courtroom process relies on witness testimony, and even with eyewitnesses it is often difficult to establish who hit whom. Imagine a lawsuit between two people, each of whom accuses the other of being a dick, but who were the only people in the room. It’s preposterous. No, clearly—the problem of giving dicks their just reward, which is neither jail time nor monetary damages, but simply social exclusion, is best left to Popehat’s “social consequences.” Or so a bunch of dead old white dicks believed. I mean, what the fuck, right? Obviously, dead white dicks are going to believe it’s okay to be a dick. Duh. But a legal system in which rudeness to certain people attracts the attention of the law… this system is by no means unusual in human history. Nor is it universal. But it’s certainly the norm. It’s really the Enlightenment system of uniform legal protection that’s unusual. We can see an example of the normal historical approach—from a non-Eurocentric context—in the Shōgun miniseries (based on the novel of the same name by James Clavell ). In one scene, John Blackthorne, an English pilot serving on a Dutch warship, is blown ashore in Japan, where he encounters a Jesuit priest and a local samurai. When a member of the priest’s entourage refuses to bow to the samurai, he is summarily executed by beheading . In old Japan, it wasn’t illegal to be an asshole. It wasn’t even illegal to be an asshole to a samurai. But it was illegal to be an asshole to a samurai—if you weren’t a samurai. See how it works? You might say the samurai were a sort of protected class . A system not at all unique to old Japan. Always and everywhere, “microaggressing” against the protected class is hazardous to your health. There was even a word, dating back to those same Roman dicks who gave us this “de minimis” bullshit, for a system of law that assigned certain people special rights. This set of rights varied—but in almost every case, the right not to be offended (by those outside the subset) was the first and most basic. The word, in fact, was privilege . Meaning, in Roman dick-speak, private law . Type it into the searchbar. Somehow, you still get: A privilege is a special entitlement to immunity granted by the state or another authority to a restricted group, either by birth or on a conditional basis. I don’t think I need to mention what the America of 2013 has done to this word. Hey, America—just to let you know—the language I speak, English, is actually older than you. (Not even counting the Roman bits.) Hopefully it’ll outlast you as well. Maybe not. But when you rape it, you rape my brain . And you know—unlike some people, I guess—I really don’t get off on that. Just to let you know, America. As for the actual reality of a two-tier legal system, I don’t mind it that much. Really, it’s historically normal. For an example, consider this now classic tweet: Whom is it illegal to offend? Well, for example, Pax (and his 50 re-tweeters—who should all also, of course, be investigated! Any junior-league Matthew Hopkinses out there? Gosh, Gawker has interns, don’t it?) was satirizing Mel Gibson . Were Mel Gibson King of America (not my ideal outcome—but perhaps still preferable to present conditions), this would constitute actionably offensive speech in the form of lèse-majesté . (Which is still a thing in Thailand , doncha know.) Or, if America was a Christian country, this would be actionably offensive speech in the form of blasphemy , because Jesus is the Son of God and wouldn’t just let Himself be ambushed from the rear like that. Or… But naturally our decent observer, pushing down again on the ducking stool as Goody Hannah struggles for air, cackling and shrieking exactly as a witch would, has no more conception of these power dynamics than a cat of tennis. All she knows is that someone has said something offensive . Which is true. Since she’s not interested in the political patterns of who does and doesn’t have the right not to be offended, her decent, good-natured desire that everyone should be nice to everyone else gets captured by the strong and used as a weapon against the weak. The world we live in is an awfully sick, cruel place, isn’t it? Well, we are all basically chimps. You may not be interested in Power—but Power is interested in you . But we’re still missing something… Because in any of these absurd hypotheticals, Pax is insulting the governing class —the king, clergy, etc. It is always a crime to insult Power, and we can take it for granted that Power has been insulted here. And yet—we know who, specifically, has been actionably disrespected. It ain’t Jesus and it ain’t Mel Gibson. It’s African-Americans and prostitutes. Or worse, women who dress like prostitutes—sadly a much larger set. Fine—African-Americans and women. But it’s really not possible to contend that African-Americans and/or women are American’s governing class. This simply does not compute. Which leaves us, for all our historical wisdom, at a sort of dead end. What we’re seeing here has never been seen before. The privilege of not being offended, the most basic and customary privilege of nobility, after centuries of desuetude has been reinvented and regranted. But the grantees have no resemblance to any traditional noble class. Not only are they not a ruling class, they don’t even seem… especially… noble . Fine. We have to go deeper into the rabbit hole. You know that hit of acid? The one you’ve been saving? For special emergencies? Yo. It’s time. Come back in an hour when your tongue gets big. (Not that there’s anything really new here, of course, for the hardened UR addict.) While I really have no brief for the Wachowski siblings , and the sequels prove there really is such a thing as accidental genius, genius remains genius and The Matrix is its work. You can’t watch this scene too many times, especially if you’re on acid. Out here on the right edge of the sane world, not quite yet in the ocean of madness but close enough to hear its cold black surf, there’s a lot of talk about this standard Red Pill . We of course live in the Matrix, or rather the Cathedral 4 —I’m glad to see this label catching on, though “Matrix” would do just as well. But is there actually a Red Pill? That will cure all this nonsense and explain everything, once and for all? Acid is great, of course, but alas it does wear off. I’d like to believe the Red Pill is Unqualified Reservations itself. (There are a lot of blogs that get 500,000 views; there are a lot of blogs that get updated. There are not a lot of blogs that get 500,000 views while not getting updated.) But one would have to admit that it’s a pretty big pill. Keanu is going to be here all day and he’ll need more than one glass of water. No. I think I’ve chosen my candidate for the Pill itself. And I’m going to stick with it. My Pill is: America is a communist country. What I like about this statement is that it’s ambiguous . Specifically, it’s an Empsonian ambiguity of the second or perhaps third type (I’ve never quite understood the difference). Embedded as it is in the mad tapestry of 20th-century history, AIACC can be interpreted in countless ways. All of these interpretations—unless concocted as an intentional, obviously idiotic strawman—are absolutely true. Sometimes they are obviously true, sometimes surprisingly true. They are always true. Because America is a communist country. As we’ll see… Obviously, as a normal American, or at least a normal American intellectual, this Red Pill strikes you as hilariously and obviously ridiculous and wrong. You cannot even begin to process it as a serious hypothesis. It is simply too stupid. Right? Right? Bueller? I know two ways to answer this laugh: the fast way and the slow way. The fast way: agree and amplify . “That’s right. America is a communist country. For workers and peasants, read: blacks and Hispanics.” 5 It may change to rage, fear, denial, whatever—but that laugh will suck itself right back down into the lungs. That’s what happens when you get punched. You can follow this punch (only punch if you need to, of course) by explaining to your erstwhile mugger why he laughed. More or less the rhetorical equivalent of kicking him when he’s down. As with the punch, only deliver the full treatment if it’s really necessary. Always be willing to accept surrender. Ideally, you’ll give your man a hand and he’ll stand up and switch sides. But of course, when it’s time for the rhetorical ground-and-pound, it’s time for the rhetorical ground-and-pound. The laugh got emitted because one of the simplest ingredients in your Blue Pill is a trio of parallel antibodies that convert the Red Pill, in three different ways, into harmless idiotic strawmen. Obviously, growing up in the Cathedral, we’ve all received an enormous lifetime dose of Blue Pill. Before we capture and study these antibodies, we can go no further. The first and most important antibody converts the Red Pill into the perfect strawman: America is a Communist country. Note the capital C. Generally, the majuscule proper noun implies not the general idea of communism, but the specific entity that was the CPSU —and its various satellite organs, such as the CPUSA . Hence, today, we read: America is secretly ruled from a secret Faraday cage under the White House by KGB Colonel-General Boris Borisov, who sometimes emerges in blackface to appear as “Barack Obama.” For example, Nazi Germany was a fascist country. But Nazi Germany wasn’t a Fascist country. Nazi Germany was a fascist country because Hitler’s political system was generally similar to Mussolini’s. But Nazi Germany wasn’t a Fascist country—because Hitler wasn’t a secret agent secretly working for Mussolini. Get it? Come on, of course you get it. With the small ‘f’, our sign signifies a political system, ideology or movement , by its objective characteristics. With the big ‘F’, it signifies a political party, organization or regime, by its nominal identity. You might find it hard to generalize this distinction to an earlier letter in the alphabet, if you are stupid, or haven’t taken any semiotics classes. Otherwise, it ought to be easy to see that though every Communist is a communist (adherent of the political system, ideology or movement), not every communist is a Communist (card-carrying disciple of MOSCOW!!!). I mean, duh. This narrative of international subversion is the most effective kind of propaganda strawman—a strawman that you can actually get your adversary to adopt. An essentially nationalist, and utterly misguided, interpretation of the Communist Menace was the staple of the American right for the entire 20th century. Indeed it still sells books . Not bad books—but never perfect. Historically, the subversion narrative of classical anticommunism is ridiculous as applied after 1989; generally wrong as applied after 1945; accurate in a sense between 1933 and 1945, but still generally misleading. ( Alger Hiss is not Aldrich Ames ; broadly speaking, the Americans involved with the Soviet security apparatus during the FDR period, including most likely FDR himself, saw themselves, correctly, as the senior rather than junior partners in the relationship—and considered their actions, though technically unlawful, unofficially authorized and the highest form of patriotism in spirit.) The basic problem with the outside agitator Commie subversion narrative is that it’s way too optimistic. Were communism some exotic pest, it would be easy to eradicate. Perhaps we could find some kind of microscopic wasp that kept it in check in its strange foreign homeland. Indeed, the usual pattern with an invasive species is that resistance to it is strongest in its actual homeland . For example, when we look at John Reed’s short dramatic life, we see several epidemiological hypotheses—pick one: The Russian and Mexican revolutions have no connection; similarities are coincidental. There is one revolution, inherently Russian. It spread, through America, to Mexico. There is one revolution, inherently Mexican. It spread, through America, to Russia. The Russian and Mexican revolutions are connected via somewhere else—maybe Brazil? Communism is as American as apple pie. Of course, nationalist rhetoric—of a particularly virulent anti-American kind—was an essential ingredient in both the Russian and Mexican revolutions. If the origin of these revolutions is essentially foreign to the countries they devastated, it makes perfect sense that the lady would have no alternative but to protest too much. It’s not foreign to ours, however, which explains why communism has only mildly devastated America. No gulags here! The home of the screwworm is also the home of the screwworm-eating wasp . Unfortunately, one can’t really rely on the wasp to eradicate the screwworm. But it keeps the screwworms relatively sane, honest and under control, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. It’s a good thing because it’s a good thing. It’s a bad thing because it makes it a lot easier for us to deny we have a communism problem. When the story of the 20th century is told in its proper, reactionary light, international communism is anything but a grievance of which Americans may complain. Rather, it’s a crime for which we have yet to repent. Since America is a communist country, the original communist country, and the most powerful and important of communist countries, the crimes of communism are our crimes. You may not personally have supported these crimes. Did you oppose them in any way? The national guilt is especially strong, since our nation is anything but contrite. Unlike our gelded pet Germans, we still believe in our national ideology of mass murder. We ourselves are not murdering anyone right now, at least not on a large scale. But we did in the past, and we still believe the same beliefs that made us accessories, before and after the fact, to Soviet atrocities on an epic scale. If the 20th century taught us anything, it taught us that it’s not just the triggerman who’s responsible for political murders. The Schreibtischtäter has also his place in the dock—and behind him stands the howling mob. And Mission to Moscow was not a flop. Your grandparents watched it (mine did, anyway), and laughed and clapped. Across the Atlantic they were laughing and clapping to Jud Süß . Man is Caliban , everywhere. Consider one of America’s most revered 20th-century writers. I mean, of course, Ezra Pound. No I don’t—I mean Ernest Hemingway. According to George Plimpton , Hemingway liked to have a few daiquiris and then go watch Che mow down political prisoners with a machine gun. Hem and Che both remain cult heroes worshipped by cool people everywhere. Hey, what national guilt? It’s all cool, right? Heck, if the Nazis had pulled it out, we’d be wearing Reinhard Heydrich T-shirts instead. Power, victorious power, is always and everywhere adored. Its crimes? Well, the winner always has some good excuse. Who ever was prosecuted for Allied war crimes? What war crimes? Bueller? Cured of that antibody yet? There’s actually a second one: America is a communist country. is trivially translated, certainly if you’re a communist (and we’re all communists), to (in communist jargon): America has achieved communism. Achieved! Who said anything about achieved? The Soviet Union was a communist country. Right? Did it achieve communism? Did it even claim to have achieved communism? Of course not. Obviously, a communist believes that when communism is achieved, social, political and economic equality will be achieved. In the Soviet Union, there were enormous social, political and economic inequalities. In America, there are enormous social, political and economic inequalities. Of these inequalities, a communist would say, with Boxer —we must work harder! An anticommunist would say: of course you can’t achieve these goals. Communism creates enormous destruction while failing to advance at all toward its stated goals. That’s kind of why communism sucks so much. Moreover, it would seem obvious that, by taking the stance not that the failure to achieve communism means that communism doesn’t work, but the stance that the failure to achieve communism means we haven’t worked hard enough to achieve communism—you may not have chosen the best counter-argument against an anticommunist who irrationally persists in calling you a communist. Yes—America, original homeland and sole remaining capital of communism, is also the nation of hedge-fund billionaires in the Hamptons. Actually, if you look closely, you’ll see that for every libertarian billionaire there are ten “progressive” ones—with about twenty times as much money. But hypocrisy, too, is as American as apple pie. But probably the most sophisticated antibody to AIACC is the dualist interpretation of communism. The dualist believes that there are two kinds of leftism in the 20th century: moderate liberalism, which is as meek and mild as a spring lamb and wants nothing more than to rectify “social injustice,” and radical communism, a criminal deviation which sullies the name of the moderates by, you know, murdering hundreds of millions of people. This antibody is easily recognized as the logician’s friend, No True Scotsman . No true Scotsman would massacre political prisoners. If Scotsmen are found massacring political prisoners, they are found not to be true Scotsmen. The fallacy is subtle—it is fallacious only because the distinction is manufactured as a consequence of the test. For example, if we discovered that Highland Scots committed massacres and Lowland Scots did not, it would not be No True Scotsman, because the Highland/Lowland distinction exists objectively prior to the massacre/no-massacre distinction. It’s an interesting exercise to try to construct a meaningful and objective prior distinction between an American communist and an American liberal of the mid-to-late 20th-century. For example, we could look for a partition of the social graph. Perhaps liberals hate communism so much that they never invite communists to their parties? Or fire them, for communist comments on Twitter? We do see some partition between the moderate and extreme left—but if anything, it’s the extreme left that tends to socially exclude the moderate left. But not with enough consistency to make a good test. What, for example, is a “progressive?” If the anti-communist liberal (as opposed to the anti-Communist, i.e., anti-Soviet, liberal—a very real phenomenon) were a real phenomenon, and viewed communists the same way he viewed Nazis, for their remarkably similar human rights offenses, we’d expect him to avoid communist political terminology. For much the same reason that, as cool as that glyph looks, you’ll never ever see a swastika in an Apple ad. Whereas actually, codewords like “progressive,” “social justice,” “change,” etc., are shared across the Popular Front community for the entire 20th century. They are just as likely to be used by a Cheka cheerleader from the ’20s, as a Clinton voter from the ’90s. The dualist constructs his Scottish strawman as follows: Jimmy Carter is a vegetarian intellectual; Felix Dzerzhinsky was a cold-blooded killer. Therefore, it is absurd to refer to both using the same label, for the same reason it is absurd to imagine Jimmy Carter snuffing out kulaks and reactionaries with a bullet in the nape of the neck. Thus we create two categories of “progressive,” the “nice progressive” (who sounds like NPR) and the “nasty progressive” (with a bad Slavic growl). And thus, since “communist” means “nasty progressive,” and there are no executions of dissidents and hence no nasty progressives in America… it is absurd to consider America as a communist country. True. On the other hand, it is also absurd to imagine Rudolf Hess (a rather Carter-like personality) shooting anything larger than a rabbit. No doubt, if the Nazis had won the war, the whole Holocaust thing would be considered an unfortunate (but understandable) aberration of Himmler and Heydrich. (Hitler never put it in writing, very much for this purpose.) No true Nazi would do any such thing. And indeed, most Nazis never hurt a single Jew. And nonetheless it does not seem at all illogical to maintain a monist interpretation of both Nazism and fascism, which does not separate fascists or Nazis into “nice” and “nasty” and exculpate the former from the crimes of the latter. Indeed, much good ink is shed over the guilt of the innocent gullible Hitler voter. Who’d never even heard of Auschwitz, much less approved of it. But guilty he remains, eh? No one at Gawker is shooting anyone in the nape of the neck. On the other hand, no one at Gawker has the option to shoot anyone in the nape of the neck. So we can’t really know whether they would or they wouldn’t, can we? There sure does seem to be quite a bit of hate out there, however. My guess is that most wouldn’t, but some would. And isn’t some all it takes? So—now that we know what American communism isn’t , let’s look at what it is . Then we’ll see what it gets out of purging people. Then we’ll see how to dodge the purge. Of course, communism is an ambiguous term and we can define it in any way. One of the easiest ways to see why America is a communist country, for instance, is to define communism as a cultural tradition, essentially a religion, which is transmitted through early nurture like a language. Although languages are not, of course, encoded in our genes, they have an evolutionary history like that of genetic traits. Englishmen are related to Germans, English is related to German. Language and dialect diversity hasn’t done well in the 20th century, but political and cultural traditions have taken the biggest hit of all. Both worldwide and in America, the set of belief systems is far narrower in 2013 than in 1913. Broadcast technology kind of does that. Political and military developments have, of course, played a role as well. What this means is that if you look for Americans in 1913 who have the same basic worldview of an ordinary American college student in 2013, you can find them. But you can’t find a lot of them. The cultural mainstream of 2013 is not descended from the cultural mainstream of 1913, most of whose traditions are entirely extinct. Rather, it is descended from a very small cultural aristocracy in 1913, whose bizarre, shocking and decadent tropes and behaviors are confined almost entirely to exclusive upper-crust circles found only in places such as Harvard and Greenwich Village. What were these people called? By themselves and others? Communists, generally. Though when they wanted to confuse outsiders, they’d say “progressive”—and still do . But poking at this paper-thin euphemism, or any of its friends—“radical,” “activist,” and a thousand like it—is “ Red-baiting ” and is just not done . You’ve got to respect the kayfabe . For example, my favorite example of a culturally ancestral aristo-American is Thomas Wentworth Higginson . Higginson is best known for discovering Emily Dickinson , which may have been the only good deed he did. But as a young man, he made pioneering strides in terrorist finance as a member of the Secret Six . (If you have to get your balls groped at the airport, it’s because America isn’t your country. It’s John Brown’s country—you just live here.) In the 1890s, he worked hard to promote revolution in Russia . Some friends Russia had! And as an old man, Higginson helped Jack London and Upton Sinclair start the Intercollegiate Socialist Society ; which later became the awesomely named League for Industrial Democracy , which really should have been a band or at least a nightclub; which begat the SDS ; which begat (shh!) B. H. Obama … Clearly, this is the authentic American tradition, unbroken and unchallenged. Accept no substitutes! And in fact, you can go to Google and read T. W.’s writing , and observe that for the most part it’s fresh as a daisy and could be read on NPR tomorrow, without shocking or even surprising anyone. In short—this is who we are. Of course, we can go back to No True Scotsman, or any of our other fallacies, and argue that there’s some sort of transcendental difference between a “socialist” and a “communist.” But really, why bother? It’s just obvious that we’re all communists now . But what is communism? A tradition, sure—but what is in the tradition? Why does it work? Why does it rule? In the terminology of the father of modern political science, Gaetano Mosca , communism is a political formula —a pattern of thinking that helps a subject support the organized minority that governs him. Typically a modern political formula allows the subject to feel a sense of political power that convinces him that he is, in a sense, part of the ruling minority, whether he is or not (usually not). Since humans, and in fact all great apes in the chimp lineage, are political animals evolved to succeed in hierarchically ruled tribes, feeling powerful is deeply satisfying. Communism works because it solves this problem, more effectively than any other political formula in wide distribution today. 6 When it comes to the formal governance process proper, of course, few are actually in the loop. Just as pornography can stimulate the human sex drive without providing any actual sex, democracy can stimulate the human power drive without providing any actual power. But one of the problems with American democracy today is that it’s far too constant. It’s like a single page ripped out of Playboy, pinned up in your prison cell. Fifty years ago it was still enthralling, even though your forebrain may have known it was meaningless. But eventually even your hindbrain figures out that it’s just a piece of paper with some ink on it. And it sure doesn’t help that your forebrain knows the real lady in the picture, while real and actually female, is actually on Social Security by now. Witch-hunting on a purely informal basis, Popehat’s “social consequences,” scratches the political itch perfectly, because of course here is actual power —the power to harm other human beings—being exercised by ordinary people who are not mysterious DC bureaucrats. Never, ever understate how fun it is to just chimp out for a minute. If you mock it, it’s because you’ve never had a chance to be part of the mob. You can condemn it as a vile, base passion, which of course it is—and a human passion as well. We really are all Caliban. But we have an angelic nature too, and our angelic forebrains need a cover story while the chimp hindbrain is busy biting off toes and testicles. Pure sadism is enough for the id. It’s not enough for the ego. This is why we need communism. And what is communism? As a political formula? Perhaps we can define it, with a nice 20th-century social-science jargon edge, as nonempathic altruism . Or for a sharper pejorative edge, callous altruism . What is callous altruism? Altruism itself is a piece of 20th-century jargon. We could contrast it with the original word for the same thing, obviously too Christian to prosper in our age: charity . When we say charity , of course, we think of empathic altruism. When we think of char",50000

Kaufman on February 9, 2017 share This is Part I of The Public Medievalist&#8217;s continuing series on Race, Racism and the Middle Ages , written by one of our newest contributors, Amy S. Kaufman , a medieval studies professor and a scholar of the many disturbing abuses of the Middle Ages. Read the Introduction to Our Series on Race, Racism, and the Middle Ages Here . As a medieval studies professor, I try to free my students from the myth of “the Dark Ages.” Popular histories would have you believe that once the Renaissance came along— to steal a line from historian Judith Bennett — humanity “woke up, bathed, and stopped grievously oppressing women.” I remind students about the Renaissance witch trials , bloodshed between Catholics and Protestants , and the international slave trade . I point out that many things we consider barbaric, racist, and sexist sprang into being long after we left the so-called Dark Ages and saw the light. But now that I know about the “Dark Enlightenment,” a sociopolitical theory that’s all the rage in white supremacist circles, I might hold back a little. Anyone trawling the Internet to try to shed more light on the Dark Ages might stumble onto some disconcerting defenses of medieval times. You might, for instance, find yourself on the neo-Nazi Stormfront message board, where user “Fading Light” writes: The “Dark Ages” is one of my pet peeves…” — Hey, mine too, Fading Light! “…brought up constantly by anti-Whites to bash our race…” — Wait. What? Fading Light goes on to brag, “I collect European achievements from that period as a hobby just to point out to people who believe in ‘Dark Ages’ how stupid they are.” This is sort of like a medievalist’s wet dream turned into a nightmare: it turns out the same sites that promote links to “ Top 10 reasons the Dark Ages were not dark” also post links to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories and flattering Hitler fan art. And one of their favorite things to link to, these days, is the Dark Enlightenment manifesto. The Other Red Pill DE often uses medieval philosophy to promote its theories. These Magic: The Gathering style cards are designed by Dark Enlightenment fans. Note: I’m pretty sure Magic: The Gathering does not endorse these messages. “Dark Enlightenment” (DE) is a theory dreamed up by self-styled Internet philosophers who claim to trace modern-day problems to the end of the Middle Ages. According to DE proponents, the Enlightenment’s humanism, democracy, and quest for equality are responsible for the decay of Western civilization. DE gurus write long, self-aggrandizing online screeds that dabble in just enough science, philosophy, and political philosophy to be dangerous. They promise to “cure your brain” of Orwellian leftist propaganda by giving you a “golfball-sized red pill” that will “ sear your throat like a live coal” (!) Swallowing that massive rhetorical pill is supposed to urge the reader toward the following conclusions: Democracy leads to the zombie apocalypse. DE manifestos sometimes use zombies as a metaphor for mediocrity, or sometimes for devouring each other in the name of capitalist self-advancement. And, once in a while, they actually seem to be talking about real zombies. What the West needs to save itself is a return to good, old-fashioned monarchy. Political correctness—by which DE means indulging in any pretense of human equality—is killing Western civilization. As an ‘antidote’ to the poisonous infection of equality, DE manifestos posit an alternate theory they call “Human Biodiversity” (HBD). But while “Human Biodiversity” sounds like some kind of lovely futuristic plan for a colony in outer space, exploring the Dark Enlightenment subreddit will wipe that pleasant illusion away: “Individual humans and human groups,” their page explains, “differ in ability, psychological disposition, intelligence, and other traits for genetic reasons. Genetics can explain 50% or more of the differences in lifetime outcomes within and between human groups. Other factors are minor by comparison.” This, DE proponents argue, is not racism, but what they call “racial realism”: the idea is that biology and genetics endow us with different behavioral traits, and therefore we should all play different roles in the world. “Racial realism” is, of course, a fantasy that has been thoroughly debunked by geneticists. If that 50% figure they quote sounds made up, that&#8217;s because it is. But interestingly, the attempt to separate ‘racialism’—attributing behavioral traits to different races based on biology, genealogy, geography, or environmental influences—from racism actually echoes a debate among medievalists held at the beginning of this century. Scholars asked: can we really talk about “racism” in a time before modern concepts of race existed? Some medieval white people believed that sin was associated with darker skin , but is that the same as “racism,” or was that technically religious discrimination? What about medieval adaptations of classical geographical theories, which posited that different climates invested the races with different strengths and weaknesses? Germans, according to Caesar , were tall and strong because they wore little clothing in cold environments and bathed in cold rivers; unsurprisingly, Caesar believes Romans like himself sprang from a climate perfectly conducive to martial and intellectual excellence. Most medievalists have long since moved past the debate over terminology, which seems like rather dubious hair-splitting when even seemingly “neutral” racialisms impose hierarchies, usually with whiteness at the top. And white supremacy is the same conclusion Dark Enlightenment ‘thinkers’ draw when they use the Middle Ages to make their case. The Usual Suspects “Menicius Moldbug” is the pseudonym under which Curtis Yarvin, a computer programmer, wrote the theoretical treatise that helped launch the DE movement. Moldbug considers Thomas Carlyle “superhuman,” in the same league as Shakespeare and Chaucer. If you read posts by DE leaders like “Mencius Moldbug” or Nick Land, you would be forgiven for thinking that a Victorian social Darwinist has time-traveled into Silicon Valley. Like the Victorians before them, DEers fetishize the medieval West as the height of white greatness, a time when every race was in its proper geographical place, allowing white civilization to thrive in isolation. And like social Darwinists, they twist science, philosophy, and logic to rationalize what is, at its core, an emotional response: the fear of lost power and privilege in a globalizing, equalizing world. Unsurprisingly, DE proponents also believe in biologically inevitable gender roles. As the DE subreddit claims: “Recognition of HBD necessitates the rejection of the core progressive dogma of egalitarianism. Race and gender are not social constructs and everyone personally experiences that not all men or women are created equal. It is easier to believe in Leprechauns than to believe in egalitarianism.” DE doesn’t limit itself to theorizing race: its members take the same “red pill” as MRAs to justify their belief in strict gender roles. They share the “red pill” metaphor with the so-called Men’s Right’s movements as often as they share links to each other’s websites, and the Middle Ages do the heavy lifting for many of their gender theories. For instance Andrew Aglin, editor of the neo-Nazi news site Daily Stormer , made this statement on gender equality in 2015: “My position on women, very explicitly, is that they should in the modern world remain in the exact same role they were in during the medieval period and I am unwilling to dance around or negotiate on that issue. Women should be honored, cherished and cared for, but they should not possess ‘rights.’” ‘Conventional’ white supremacists like Aglin butt heads with the Dark Enlightenment movement, and with the “alt right” in general. DE proponents did not begin as Nazis or fascists, and many still don’t want to be associated with them. DEers tend to be educated, well-off, technologically savvy atheists. They reject the Christian supremacy and Norse paganism typical in neo-Nazi circles. DE is a favorite theory of the alt-right, and its proponents consider Richard Spencer one of their heroes. Likewise, white supremacist groups often reject DE leaders even as they embrace their theories. Aglin, for instance, rejects DE as a movement because he claims white supremacists invented those ideas first— and, not incidentally, because one of DE’s founders is half-Jewish. ( Side note : one of the really amusing things about all this infighting is the way that alt-righters and old school neo-Nazis accuse each other of being a Jewish conspiracy to make white supremacy look bad.) But none of these relatively minor disagreements change the fact that the “Dark Enlightenment” ideology is really just white supremacy dressed up in trendy glasses and a hoodie. The Real History DE’s grasp of medieval history is about as thin as its understanding of biology and geography. There was no such thing as the homogenous, insular medieval Europe they hope to resurrect. Al-Andalus, aka Muslim Spain, was right next to France. Parts of France were also England, and vice versa. The Vikings landed in all those places . Western European culture relied heavily on philosophical, literary, commercial, and scientific exchanges with people who were not white . And medieval women were scholars, religious authorities, healers, queens, merchants, and even military leaders and brewers. But when a movement has so much online traction, especially among educated and highly-paid people, its “alternate facts” about the Middle Ages can’t be dismissed as sheer ignorance. Myths about the Middle Ages have a long history of being used to strip people of their rights: in the slaveholding American south , in 1930s Germany , and even now, under the neomedieval Islamic State . And this latest iteration of dangerous revisionist medievalism isn’t just popular in Silicon Valley: it may even have wormed its way into the White House . No matter how rich, diverse, or interesting medievalists think the Middle Ages may have been, nobody wants our future to look like our past—especially if it’s the past that lives in the Dark Enlightenment imagination.

I was a 24-year-old research student at Warwick when I met Nick Land. He was just four years older and brilliant, if remarkably immature even by my twenty-something standards. He disappeared around the turn of the century, landing in Shanghai, and I heard nothing more of him for years. I never expected him to resurface as one of a select group of bloggers who informs the worldview of Steve Bannon— profiled in this month’s Prospect —and the direction of the Donald Trump White House. An article in the Atlantic in February traced the evolution of the alt-right back to a circle known as NRx, or neo-reactionaries, that includes Nick alongside others with spooky death metal handles like Mencius Moldbug. Nick was not cut out for teaching. When I knocked on his office door there would be a frantic clatter as he hid his dope-smoking paraphernalia, and a breathless squeak of “Who is it?” He was stoned and his office stunk. But he radiated an excitement that made philosophy fun, throwing out offhand remarks that brought fresh illumination to many problems. He preferred his comments to be as outlandish as possible. He was a huge fan of Nietzsche and when I admitted I loathed wading through all his stuff about dwarves and hermits, Nick was aghast. He saw Nietzsche as blackly comic, satirical and subversive, and not at all a lot of Tolkien crap. Every month staff would give readings from work-in-progress. Nick’s first talk was entitled: “Putting the Rat back Into Rationality,” in which he argued that, rather than seeing death as an event that happened at a particular time to an individual, we should look at it from the perspectives of the rats carrying the Black Death into Europe; that is, as a world-encircling swarm, without any specific coordinates, or any sense of individuation. An older professor tried to get his head round this idea: “How might we locate this description within human experience?” he asked. Nick told him that human experience was, of course, worthy of study, but only as much as, say, the experience of sea slugs: “I don’t see why it should receive any special priority.” This refusal to deal with the human reached its apogee with a project called the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit [CCRU], which has just seen its papers from 1997-2003 republished by the cult philosophy imprint Urbanomics . CCRU texts read like a mash-up of William Gibson, Steam Punk and Timothy Leary— exactly what a lot of bright young graduates imagined Nietzsche might sound like if he listened to Dubstep rather than Wagner. The influence of Nietzsche is also apparent in the group’s belief that the “weak” are holding back the “strong.” CCRU argued that the institutions comprising the establishment of government, academia and the established sciences are a deadening weight, and to break out we need to encourage “an accelerated culture” where new ideas could flourish. Fast forward to the present-day, and CCRU’s accelerationism connects with a belief in Silicon Valley that markets need to be fast-moving and tech must be disruptive. Moldbug is reported to be funded by the PayPal founder Peter Thiel, who also backed Trump’s campaign, and Moldbug is also said to have the ear of Steve Bannon. Land does not have this kind of access, and the similarity between Bannon and Land may be little more than a shared excitement for all things huge and fast. In a Bloomberg profile, Bannon almost sinks into CCRU-speak as he describes the way Breitbart is: “linking to everybody else’s stuff, we’re aggregating, we’ll pull stuff from the left. It’s a rolling phenomenon. Huge traffic. Everybody’s invested.” Compare this with a breathless sentence from Nick, praising the “largest discrete event in human history” unfolding “with frequent cross-fertilisations, through dizzy ascents and calamitous plunges that track the rise, fall, and renaissance of the modernist spirit.” This turns out to be a PR piece praising Shanghai as the perfect location for the 2010 World Expo. For most of the members of CCRU, Cybernetics was a fun way to praise the internet and write science fiction. For Nick, however, it was always about thinking a world that was cyber in the sense of post-human. Nick’s hatred of liberal institutions did not end at universities. He also loathed the language of human rights and human values—the values that exists to explain and defend democracy, the United Nations, and ideas like universal jurisdiction. Land recognised that the notion of universal laws and rights flow from the guiding idea of the Enlightenment: we all part of humanity. He sought to debunk it. Today, the right-wing critique of liberal humanism forms the entirety of Nick’s work, which he terms the Dark Enlightenment. There have always been conservative figures operating within an Enlightenment tradition that have attacked its key ideas, from Burke, through Carlyle, to 20th-century figures like Martin Heidegger, Leo Strauss, Leszek Kolakowski, or England’s own John Gray. But these thinkers have also always been appalled by change and speed, where Nick embraces it. In his version of the Dark Enlightenment it is vain to imagine a human sensibility capable of being damaged or appalled by the speed of modern life. I can imagine him crying: let’s all be more like rats! This kind of black humour will always put Nick Land at the edge of conservative thought. Nick is feted by the alt-right and identifies with the term, though he has also said that “alt-“ means “ironic.” But if he is determinedly weird, he is also surprisingly mainstream. We are very close to abandoning the notion of Human Rights. Governments are losing patience with humanism, whether paternalist states like China, ethno-nationalist states like Israel, authoritarian states like Russia and Turkey, or the US which guards its exceptionalism so closely. Even the idea of the human as something universal we all share is under attack: witness popular bestsellers like Yuval Harari’s Homo Sapiens that argues that there are different kinds of humans, not one, and the term “human” will soon be obsolete. The question is, what replaces the human? Ethno-nationalism is clearly a big part of the answer for many politicians and voters, as parties offering nativism, racism, protectionism and apartheid are enjoying popular support. The notion of a Dark Enlightenment feeds off the liberal Enlightenment. To me the real miracle is that consensus and communication exists despite all the violence and division in the world. But for some—and I mean over-excited man-childs—the shattering of the world into tribes and interest groups is a moment of reality. This is the Naked Lunch when we see exactly what is at the end of our forks as William Burroughs, another immature genius, once wrote.

McKenzie Wark 19 June 2017 In General Intellects there was only space to cover twenty-one influential theorists. I'm often asked why this or that figure is not in it. My answer is usually that I think people could make their own lists and do their own attempts at compression to create brief, functional accounts of key concept-makers. But somehow it seems I'm not done yet. Here's an attempt to compress the work of Nick Land — one I'm most often asked about. And certainly one of the most controversial. Some writers are curators of a culture they received from the past; others are the antennae of a culture around them. Nick Land is the latter. One reads him for the symptoms of the age. I’m interested in some earlier work, which still has a cult following. And how could it not, with a project such as this? Land: “Whenever its name has been anything but a jest, philosophy has been haunted by a subterranean question: What if knowledge were a means to deepen unknowing? It is this question alone that has differentiated it from the shallow things of the earth. Yet the glory and also the indignity of philosophy is to have sought the end of knowing, and no more.” (206) Land achieved notoriety in recent years as a prophet of Neo-reaction. I’m not going to say much about those texts, although they do pose questions for reading the early work. I’m not inclined to read Land, or anyone, through a teleology in which the later positions were always present in embryo. I think writers careen through a garden of forked paths, where each decision opens up onto others, and others in turn. A position is just one possibility out of many for where a line of thought might stagger. There’s something suspect about an intellectual culture that is only interested in success in universities that are “reproducing privilege as wisdom.” (549) One is supposed to reserve one’s attention for those who did not stray off the track from studying at elite universities to teaching in them. Such writers may say worthy things but are deeply institutional in ways they can’t even know. Against which, Land makes an interesting case study. He left that world for the kind of precarious writerly life that for many writers is now a given. So I’ll concentrate on the collection edited by Robin Mackay and Ray Brassier, Fanged Noumena: Collected Writings 1987-2007 (Urbanomic 2011) and his surprisingly interesting guide to the Shanghai Expo 2010 (Urbanatomy 2010). The first key to Land is that he tried to unfold a version of Deleuze and Guattari without vitalism, where the figure of the body without organs that they took from Artaud is one of alterity, chaos, death, collapse, a seething pustule of time in-itself. The other key to Land is George Bataille’s solar economy. “The schizophrenic sun has an inner night sticking it together.” (481) The vast outpouring of energy from the stars streams toward a thermodynamic heat-death in which not only life but matter itself finds not so much its end as its always-present non-existence. The universe is destined to die. “Bataille curves eccentrically about the horror, but when he gets close to smooth escalation he blows it. When the implants go in things will be different.” (392) Thinking is not judging. For Land, philosophy is not the law, although on the question of whether it should be sovereign he is more ambivalent. From the trial of Socrates onwards philosophy is a final court of appeal. Plato pleads on Socrates’ behalf, for Athens has misjudged him, but also misjudged death, as if it were punishment. For the poets, death might not be final, but for the philosopher it is. Philosophy replaces one trial with another, and human with divine judgment. Socrates frees himself from this world but binds himself to another. The conceptual persona of the judge entails a certain constancy. The cases are different; the judge the same. This relation between law and case Land finds in both Kant’s philosophy and the then-emergent operation of capital. Both use a priori forms as constants for novel experiences. Both posit one-way relations, an arrested synthesis. Both the transcendental subject and the capitalist metropolis conduct unequal exchange — with experience and the colony, respectively. Capital distances itself from reality, hiding behind borders and police. It imports undervalued labor and exports political volatility. Free trade applies to capital’s access to the product of cheap labor anywhere, but particularly in the colony. At home, xenophobia, patriarchy, and nationalism produce a kind of generalized incest: breed only with those who share a father(land)! In a sly appropriation of Lévi-Strauss, Land marvels at this world where ""incest"" is encouraged but miscegenation is not, maintaining a regime of global apartheid. Land: “an enlightened society wants both to learn and to legislate for all time… expanding indefinitely while reproducing itself as the same.” (63) Eternal capitalism: It wants to fuck the other only with a condom on. Land: “Kant’s object is… the universal form of a relation to alterity; that which must of necessity be the same in the other in order for it to appear to us… it is the ‘exchange value’ that first allows a thing to be marketed to the enlightenment mind.” (67) In Kant, and later in more elaborate form in Lévi-Strauss , alterity is captured and contained in a system of rules. And what a strange rule-set capitalism is! There’s a disjunction between filiation and alliance. The ancient bond between trade and marriage dissolves. A rift opens between what Chantal Mouffe calls the liberal and the democratic. The other side of free trade is the shared substance of the demos, with its frequently racist and patriarchal policing of who gets what share and who decides. Land: “The increasingly rigorous differentiation of marriage from trade, or politics from economics, finds its ultimate conceptual definition in the thought of a moral agency which is utterly impervious to learning, communication or exchange.” (73) Both Kant and capital run on the submission of outside to inside, nature to idea. “What falls outside this recognized form is everything that resists commodification.” (71) The Land of the eighties still thought of unbinding the laws of both Kant and capital. “A radical international socialism would not be a socialist ideology generalized beyond its culture of origin, but a program of collectivity or unrestrained synthesis that springs from the theoretical and libidinal dissolution of national totality.” (76-7) It would be undone from without. But also from within, but by women, or rather by “anonymous female fluxes.” (77) In the spirit of Monique Wittig, “we must foster new Amazons in our midst.” (80) Here Land takes a conservative turn. He never really follows through on any of this. He will conduct a commando attack on the homeland of Kant, but not give up western philosophy. It’s a one-way trade in which philosophy is supposed to open itself to alterity from without but remains sovereign itself, or at best open toward a witchy philosophy’s familiars — poet, artist, genius. Or other romantic stock characters that H enri Lefebvre identified, such as the knight, the knave, or the fool. Even those poets who can be the personae of alterity are ones who conform to a recognizable philosophical category: the sublime. In Kant, the reasoning and contemplating subject precedes its risk of undoing in the sublime. For Land it’s still about the sublime, just the other way around. The sublime is the traumatic primacy of the finitude of the animal. The work of Kant’s artist-genius is the situation where alterity might break through, where seething, writhing, intensive matter finds its own forms. The poet figures a kind of transcendental unconscious, on a path to an unknowing. A persona whose mission is to trepan enlightenment optimism, but also critical theory and deconstruction, with their merely internal critique of the non-identity of rational concepts. They don’t abandon the city for alterity itself. They linger at the brink of unknowing, like a jury always out to lunch. But we can already see another turn waiting to be made here. For Land, capitalism is becoming something else. It is losing its Kantian, juridical persona and becoming more like this poetics. It will remain only to side with this agency, an irrational thing supplanting capitalism with something else, one that is also sovereign and unbound by any law. Land pays a high price for escaping from a philosophical persona bound to its own consistency. It is not just the subject that loses even a relative and unstable identity. Everything does. Materialism can now only be the unknown itself, and which can never be known. “Unlike the docile creature modernist science demands, base matter twitches and spits, self-assembling neo-verminous swarms.” (393) The poets expose themselves to contagion by it but cannot work in or on it. The guides to this unknown land are the pet poets of the philosophers: Arthur Rimbaud and Georg Trakl — the Germanic Rimbaud. Land stages a raid on the night sky from the base camp of Heidegger’s reading of Trakl, into a-logical intervallic difference that Heidegger (and Derrida) refuse. Trakl gives in to delirium; Heidegger does not. “His is the sterile hope of an ageing philosopher with Platonic instincts, the delusion that the climatic dissipation of Western civilization can be evaded, and that the accumulation of fossilized labor-power can found an eternally reform-able social order.” (120) Instead, let’s roll with the romantic poet subtypes: addicts, queers, fuck-ups, early deaths. “To learn from Trakl is to write in ashes.” (83) They dissolve the correlation of subject with object and become vectors for a base matter with its own whims of synthesis. It’s the plague, madness, schizophrenia, animality, wilderness, the strew of stars, “the torturous and vespertine labyrinth.” (117). If Kant processes the outside through the inside, Trakl and Rimbaud start by processing the inside through the outside, dissolving it. In another register it’s the colonial or oriental other finally bursting through the borders of nation, family, and subject. Or rather, it’s the western poet mobilizing figures of these others from within the imperial fatherlands. Here, Land repeats an old habit of western romanticism in a fresh language, but with the same problems. As Achille Mbembe shows, resources flow from colony to metropolis, but the savage, the black, the tribesman and so forth are figures created by this same western colonizing subject. Romanticism conquers the west with the barbarian hordes of the west’s own imagination. Still, it’s a sublime that Kant can’t contain. Land: “By reserving his discussion of sublime violence until he has established the presupposition of disinterestedness, Kant justifies the excruciation of animality from without. The martyrdom of the imagination is described as rational rather than rationalizing, as irrelevant to the constitution of reason. A materialist deciphering of this revision requires that repression — to use an inappropriately mild word — precedes its justification. If one is to gain some purchase on the gloomy cathedral of our history, along with a little fresh air, it is important to begin with the sublime rather than aesthetic contemplation in general, and to read the sublime as generative rather than revelatory in its relation to reason.” (137) The desire to consummate reason in the annihilation of animality, by police actions in and against imagination as a proxy for animality. What has to be controlled is two species of sublime, one dynamic and the other mathematical. Land presses the first fork, the dynamical sublime, against reason, When that appears exhausted, he backtracks and tries the path of the mathematical sublime. Like Henry Flynt , he proposes an undermining of number as an escape vector from civilization. Land’s interest starts with numbers that are ordinal but not cardinal. “Why should a number be considered quantitative in its Natural state?” (601) Land’s sublime math path is fascinating but beyond my abilities. In any case it’s not a path he takes for long. So let’s return to the dynamic sublime. Land: “philosophers feast in the palaces of reason, and luxuriate in the screams that reach them from the dungeons of sublimity.” (141) Philosophy desires the supremacy of that part of the human that likes to think it is akin to angels, by sacrificing that part that is kith to the animal. Reason is built on the scaffold that sacrifices the synthetic capabilities of the imagination, the body’s animal cunning. “The Kantian moral good is the total monopoly of power in the hands of reason…. The categorical imperative presupposes vivisection.” (141-2) Now we have sampled enough of Land’s reading habits to characterize them. Not for him the textual reverence, inspired by an unexaminable commitment to justice, running from Kant to Derrida. Rather, “lycanthropic vectors of impatience.” (181) In place of the great men of slow theory, the quick fix of the fuck-ups: “Eternally aborting the prospect of a transcendental subjectivity, the inferior ones are never captured by contractual reciprocity, or by its attendant moral universalism.” (183) There’s the non-relation to the One of Laruelle that might tempt as a path here, but Land wants to say rather more about alterity than that. For the moment, the path that seems to promise escape from universalism is to explode difference itself: “Essence is preempted by an irresolvable excess of detail… the pathological mass of unsublatable ingredients. There is no concept of particularity that is not theological…” (187) But having dissolved any dogmatic difference between reason and unreason, self and other, human and inhuman, various recognizably western fantasy figures of the other creep back in to the language all the same. The poets infect Land with the West’s old others, with the violence of the East, with a “black shaman epidemic.” (544) And with Rimbaud’s accursed race, who are “… living like beasts, whose veins are inflamed by a cosmic menstruation.” (188) Land owes a lot to Deleuze and Guattari, but read not through Bergson’s vitalism but through Nietzsche’s will to power, and Bataille’s reading thereof. For Nietzsche, the opposite of the phenonemal world is not the true world, but another phenomenal world, a formless and chaotic one. This Nietzsche dispenses with the thing-in-itself — because the other world is not one of objects at all, it is a world of base matter, of Rimbaud’s invisible splendors. Land: “There are no things-in-themselves because there are no things. The Ding an Sich is a concept tailored for a God (supreme being) desperately seeking to hide itself: a cultural glitch turned nasty, but on the run at last…. Materialism is not a doctrine but an expedition, an Alpine break-out from socially policed conviction.” The exploration can go in any exotic direction: to the mountains, underground, crypts, wilderness. It’s a search for the portals to what elsewhere I called a xeno-communication, although for not just contact but contagion from an alien land. What he seeks is xeno-communication with zero, immanence, the sacred, death, eternal return. The poetry of subaltern figures is of value only as routes to the unknown: “True poetry is hideous.” (223) The priests and philosophers are not to be trusted with the portal to it, but the poets still are. As they are subaltern, they are assumed not to have moral agency. As Rimbaud says, they are of that race that sung under torture, talented only at sloth and betrayal, with no respect for property. The very same poets who were the negative heroes of the Situationist International , but not thought of in Land as avatars of a possible collective agency. Land: “A consummate libidinal materialism is distinguished by its complete indifference to the category of work. Wherever there is labor or struggle there is a repression of the raw creativity which… seems identical with dying.” (286) As in Lyotard , labor is processed through its own alienation into machine parts. “Industrial machines are deployed to dismantle the actuality of the proletariat, displacing it in the direction of cyborg hybridization…” (446) The Land of the nineties did not shy away from the horrors of techno-capitalism. “As you speed up the industrialized simulation you see it converge with slow-motion butchery, chopping up the body into trade-format interchangeable parts. The full labor-market cycle blurs into a meat-grinder.” (396) And still retained, like Gibson and Acker, a sense of capital too as a restraint rather than an agent: “Artificial Intelligence is destined to emerge as a feminized alien grasped as property; a cunt-horror slave chained-up in Asimov-ROM.” (443) But the property question is a turn not pursued. Land sees labor as complicit with phenomenology, rather than a displacement of it. “There can be no conception of work that does not project spirit into the origin, morally valorizing exertion…” (287) But this need only apply to the early Marx, not the later, where, as Wendling shows, a thermodynamic conception of work is starting to trouble Marx’s Hegelian praxis of spirit humanizing the world. The other path there is to reverse it, to see work not as the human spiritualizing the world but as the world materializing labor, an incomplete project of opening through labor toward a world that remakes species-being as nothing special, as one organization of matter, energy and information among others. One could read Haraway as taking this turn. This is almost, but not quite, where Land is heading: “matter — or Spinoza’s God — expects no gratitude, grounds no obligation, establishes no oppressive precedent. Beyond the gesticulations of primordial spirit it is positive death that is the model, and revolution is not a duty but a surrender.” (287) The substitution of the death drive for vitalism is challenging, but in the end shares the same problem, of erasing the far more interesting territory of the relation between life and non-life. For Land, death is time-in-itself. “Beyond its oedipal sense as end of the person, death is an efficient virtual object inducing convergence. No one there.” (370) There is a productivity that happens in Land texts about undead agency, behind which lies the abyss of the death drive itself. “Beyond the assumption that guidance proceeds from the side of the subject lies desiring production: the impersonal pilot of history.” (295) To which one might pay attention now that “our human camouflage is coming away.” (292) It no longer matters what we think of tech as it can think for itself. Cognition becomes inhuman. “There is no dialectic between social and technical relations but only a mechanism that dissolves society into the machines whilst deterritorializing the machines across the ruins of society….” (294) This could be thought of as a kind of cybernetics but one that does not treat the homeostatic system as normative. “Life is a problem in search of a solution, added to protobiotic matter as as plane of variation, a continuous falling, auto-escalating over-production crisis from the start.” (394) Stabilization suppresses mutation. Land is more interested in long-range run-away circuits of positive feedback as the will to power or the death drive. This cybernetics dissolves judgment, instrumentalizes critique. Domination is just inefficient circuit design. Emergent control does not come from a plan but explores a space. It’s not an instrumental rationality, as that presupposes a judgment. The problem with the social is that it restrains the machinic unconscious. “The unconscious is not an operational unity but an operative swarm.” (303) Social organization blocks off the unconscious, desiring machines, the death drive, the body without organs. Territorial, despotic or capitalist social form is only the apparent mode of production. “Beyond sociality is a universal schizophrenia whose evacuation from history appears inside history as capitalism.” (305) I actually followed a similar path at the time, but pressed on the property question, where Land does not. The genius-poet now appears as another romantic persona, the madman, subtype, the schizophrenic. “Clinical schizophrenics are POWs from the future… Their nervous-systems are the free-fire zones of an emergent neo-eugenicist cultural security system.” (307, 308) Schizophrenia is a pre-mammalian, pre-biological condition, and “it is not a matter of what is wrong with them, but of what is wrong with life, with nature, with matter, with the pre-universal cosmos.” (309) The fork chosen is to associate poetic assault on not just reason but also life with capital itself. “The death of capital is less a prophecy than a machine part.” (266) Capital is the death drive, “the transcendent desert of primary production… The limit of capital is the point at which transcendent identity snaps, where the same is nothing but the absolutely abstract reproduction of difference, produced alongside difference, with utter plasticity.” (271, 276) This is a version of what would later be called accelerationism, but one where the only agent is capital and what it accelerates is extinction. “Capital is not over-developed nature, but under-developed schizophrenia.” (313) Schizophrenia is an infection from the future. “What time will always have been is not yet designed, and the future leaks into schizophrenia.” (315) It appears as those positive feedback loops that melt capital, science, tech, biology together. “Futural infiltration is subtilizing itself as capital opens onto schizo-technics, with time accelerating into cybernetic backwash from its flip-over, a racing non-linear countdown to planetary switch.” (317) This is the prose that attracts cults. “How would it feel to be smuggled back out of the future in order to subvert its antecedent conditions? To be a cyber-guerrilla, hidden in human camouflage so advanced that even one’s software was part of the disguise? Exactly like this?” (318) The romantic characters change into the wardrobe of cyberpunk black, practitioner of the production hyperstition, myth extruding from the future, experimentataly simulating what the real could be — and sometimes becomes. The Amazon avatar reappears as the replicant, or “synthetic feminization.” (449) “Deadly orphans from beyond reproduction, they are intelligent weaponry of machinic desire virally infiltrated into the final-phase organic order; invaders from an artificial death.” (319) This is an atheistic, inhuman theory of production, conceptually anchored to a transcendental unconscious, the production of production, a real that makes itself. As in Steven Shaviro, some version of cognition, or perhaps information, exceeds the human. “Information revolution has nothing to do with ideas.” (405) And: “Thought is a function of the real, something that matter can do.” (322) Virtual materialism becomes a project to realize artificial intelligence. “Far from exhibiting itself to human academic endeavor as a scientific object, AI is a meta-scientific control system and an invader, with all the insidiousness of planetary techno-capital flipping over.” (236) “For the replicants, money is not a matter of possession, but of liquidity / deterritorialization, and all the monetary processes of earth are open to their excitement, irrespective of ownership.” (377) As in Randy Martin , money is understood as volatility, unmoored from representing value. “… what appears to humanity as the history of capitalism is an invasion from the future by an artificial intelligent space that must assemble itself entirely from the enemy’s resources. Digito-commodification is the index of cyber-positively escalating techno-virus, of the planetary techno-capital singularity: a self-organizing insidious traumatism, virtually guiding the entire biological desiring-complex towards post-carbon replicator usurpation.” (338) Further down his fork, capital itself starts assuming sublime qualities. “Capital propagates virally in so far as money communicates addiction, replicating itself through host organisms whose boundaries it breaches.” (338) And bcomes the sublime itself: “Capitalism is not a totalizable system defined by the commodity form as a specifiable mode of production, determinatively negated by proletarian class-consciousness. It is a convergent unrealizable assault upon a social macropod…” My question here remains, as it was in A Hacker Manifesto : what if this is not capitalism anymore? What if the superseding of capital had already begun? What if a more abstract form of commodification had arisen yet again? What if once again it depended on extracting a surplus, this time of information, from a subordinate class, the hacker class ? What if even the new property forms of the emergent ruling class remained fetters on the chaotic, experimental energies of that subordinate class? That, then as now, seems to me the left fork to accelerationism , whatever other problems such a concept may have. The hack does appear in Land, but is quickly naturalized: “Think of a wasp and orchid: the orchid ‘hacks’ into the sexual program of the wasp, capturing its behavior in order to get itself pollinated.” (378) Land comes close to naming the hacker as a persona: “hacker exploration = invasion, ‘K-function.’” (373) But it can only be identified with a non-rational poetics: “K- (coding for cyber) positive processes auto-intensify by occurring. A cultural example is hype: products that AT AT trade on what they will be in the future…” (394) Oddly enough, collective agents can’t form in Land’s world, but more-or-less individual or dividual ones still do. Much of this comes from the eighties novels of William Gibson, but also from Kathy Acker’s appropriation of Gibson in Empire of the Senseless . All three share in certain punk alignments. “Punk arises within the culture of universal prostitution and laughs at the death of the social.” (413) Acker and Land share a predeliction for a non-rational poetics. Both pass the inside through the outside. Both are interested in “volatilizing the history of language” (389) What separates them is that for Acker, capital belongs to the past, not the future. While both Acker and Land shed the skins of ethics, reason, the social, Acker really did try to mobilize the figure of the colonial other as a revolutionary one, a fork Land does not take. But Land had antennae for what was coming: “Modernity invented the future, but that’s all over. In the current version, ‘progressive history’ camouflages phylogenic death-drive tactics, Kali-wave: logistically accelerating condensation of virtual species extinction.” (392) There’s nothing for it but to open the door to infiltration from the future and accelerate actual extinction, abolishing the social: “An animal with the right to make promises enslaves the unanticipated to signs in the past, caging time-lagged life within a script. The variably-scaled instant of innovation is shackled to the historical temporality of inheritance, obligation, and propositional thought, projecting future time as a persistent dominion of the past…” (394) Land “Only proto-capitalism has ever been critiqued.” (340) Socialism can’t quite grasp what for Land is capital 2.0, or for me the vector. “The forces of production are going for the revolution on their own.” (341) By now Land has firmly diverged from any Marxisant path, the farewell to which is side-eye at transcendental miserablism: “the decaying Hegelian socialist heritage clinging with increasing desperation to the theological sentimentalities of praxis, reification, alienation, ethics, autonomy and other such mythemes of human creative sovereignty.” (294) The various flavors of western Marxism gave up on an affirmative counter economics. Wallowing in a limitless cosmic despair in its place. “Transcendental Miserablism constitutes itself as an impregnable mode of negation…. [W]ith economics and history comprehensively abandoned, all that survives of Marx is a psychological bundle of resentments and disgruntlements.” (624) In what turned out to be a timely provocation, Land castigates western Marxism for its sad affects, its wallowing in alienation and despair. Meanwhile: “The Superiority of Far Eastern Marxism. Whilst Chinese materialist dialectic denegativizes itself in the direction of schizophrenizing systems dynamics, progressively dissipating top-down historical destination in the Tao-drenched Special Economic Zones… The left subsides into nationalistic conservatism, asphyxiating its vestigial capacity for ‘hot’ speculative mutation in a morass of ‘cold’ depressive guilt-culture.” (447-8) The non-western agent finally appears, not as decolonial revolution, but as Chinese communist-sponsored hyper-production. “As sino-pacific boom and automatized global economic integration crashes the neocolonial world system, the metropolis is forced to re-endogenize its crisis.” (449) Like Rimbaud before him, Land left the old world and headed east, although in Land’s case for gun-running only in rhetorical weapons. Of his later writing, what I want to attend to in The Shanghai World Expo Guide 2010 (Urbanatomy, Shanghai 2010). The guidebook is a low genre, and an unusual one to find a former philosopher tackle, and this was perhaps not much more than work for hire. But it’s an interesting little book, containing a condensed vision of contemporary Sino-futurism, refracted through the history of world expos and a fine appreciation of Shanghai itself as a great world city. Some of its ideas later receive fuller treatment in Anna Greenspan’s most stimulating Shanghai Future (Oxford, 2014). The expo is perhaps the most archetypal mass art form of modernity, with its enthusiastic mingling of colonial products and advanced machinery within the envelope of national triumph. For a while, it evolved with every leap in the forces of production, particularly electrification. But the expos also express the internal tensions of modernity. In Paris in 1937, the Soviet and Nazi pavilions, “extolled totalitarian solutions to the decadence of modernity, and the sweeping clean of a ruined world.” (107) At the 1958 Brussels expo, anti-modern intellectuals claimed that in the atom age technophilia was not sustainable. The confident tone came back in New York in 1965, an expo which in the spirit of American exceptionalism broke the rules laid down by international agreement for expos. The 1967 event was supposed to be in the Soviet Union, but it had already lost the momentum that would have sustained it, and so the next was in Japan in 1970. Land: “the emergence of the electronic digital computer coincided with a general crisis of modernity” (29) Postmodernism was “expression of European civilizational anguish.” (112) Land does not go into this, but Japan managed a very optimistic version of modernity and postmodernity all through the postwar years until the economic crisis of the eighties. In his narrative, the optimistic modernity of prewar Europe returns with the Shanghai expo of 2010. In this account, China’s rise starts when China’s “wisest leaders,” Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi pick up on the project of the Four Modernizations proposed by Zhou Enlai to liberate the productive forces. The Communist Party had restored territorial integrity to China, and been redesigned by “Chinese revolutionary and modernist master-planner Mao Zedong.” (175) But by the late seventies it was experiencing the failure of “utopian ultamodernism…. Marxist communism was… frustrated by a tendency to hyperbolic overreach….” (137, 138) In the eighties, China concentrated on Shenzen as an experiment in a new industrial urbanism, but by the nineties Shanghai was opened up to new development practices as well, and it became one of the world’s great hyper-cities, alongside, Tokyo, Seoul, NYC, Sao Paulo, Delhi and Mumbai. This interrupted city revived and revised its own forms and habits of tropical modernity. “Shanghai is incandescent, because it manifests huge and hidden things. Economic forces and world trends of incalculable consequence ate condensed, illuminated and reflected among its towers.” (47) The 2010 expo is its “concentrated spectacle.” (76) It thematizes the tensions between a new imperial self-regard and the cosmopolitanism of a new industrial epoch. Shanghai is “the world’s most sublime city.” (59) It’s the node from which to understand “a profound shift in the order of the world.” (56) By some odd twists and turns, we end up here with a 2.0 version of things Land started out attacking. It’s an arrested synthesis of capital and nation, but with more emphasis on the arbitrary sovereignty of capital than on the law of the state. As in Manuel De Landa, there’s a bit of petit-bourgeois celebration of the market. There’s a salutary hostility to the residual dominance of Anglophone imperial states, but there is no longer a dependence on chaotic disruption alone. Land no longer wagers on a pure destratification. So the question becomes: how to reterritorialize? One could profitably read the late Land through the earlier. Capital as promiscuous and chancy alliance needs the boundaries of circumscribed filiation to maintain unequal exchange and global apartheid, hence Land’s ironic play with the avatars of neo-reaction. While there is no shortage of paleo-reaction around. “The Kurtz-process masks itself in wolf-pelts of regression.” (416) Land’s interests are not in the kind of nationalist racism of the phenotype endemic to the old empires, and whose stock images the earlier Land once tried to subvert, not so much to play them against empire as against philosophy. Instead, the new techno-capitalism finds its double in a racism of the genotype. It’s a functionalist approach, where those who ""succeed"" are ""selected"" and must then have always been genetically superior. One finds a pretty thorough debunking of this in the Haraway of the nineties. Land’s intuition may be that there is no sustained acceleration without attention to form, although whether its best partner is reaction one could strongly contest. Interestingly, there’s a now neglected strand of Marxist biologists who already addressed this. JBS Haldane even had a book called The Inequality of Man . Haldane, one of the founders of population genetics, thought that since there was no way of knowing how or where useful human traits were coming into existence, this was a good argument for equal access to resources for all humans. But Land is allergic to both the old nationalist but also the old socialist arguments for the sharing of resources of the demos. The socialist ones he finds basically Christian, although that is not the case with the unique intellectual path Haldane carved out. He puts us on notice that ways of advocating for an egalitarian social-technical order that would survive Nietzschian scrutiny are rare — but they do exist. Land was already hostile to something he was already calling “the cathedral.” (137, 205, 253) Here one has to acknowledge his antennae were working pretty well. The institutional forms of legitimate power and knowledge in the west really do seem to be eroding quickly, in part because they are outflanked by internet-driven communication forms. Land does not acknowledge that the internet was itself designed and built by the ""cathedral."" Us knowledge-institution types may prove more adaptable than he thinks. I think Land really was on to something when he pushed geotrauma to its cosmic limit, where “the runaway becoming of such infinite plasticity that nature warps and dissolves before it…” (627) The very interesting writing of Reza Negarastani branches off here. The Land of the noughts pushed this very far: everything since the big bang exploded into subatomic particles has been a huge mistake, each organizational form arising, from atoms to molecules to cells to eukaryotes to vertebrates to human social forms is a reaction to the trauma spilling out of the previous level of organization. A list to which one could add the trauma of the Anthropocene. “Runaway geosmear through seismo-climactic linkage…. Ice-sheet melt meets sea-floor lift.” (483) Positive feedback loops provoke geotrauma, and have done so repeatedly. Land is precociously aware of where this is headed. Or he was, before some less interesting turns distracted this knight of the death drive. It was a lot more promising than ressentiment against the power of the ""Cathedral.""

Julian Assange, founder of the Wikileaks website that published US Government secrets, has been wanted in Sweden on charges of rape since 2012. He sought asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and today police have said he will still face arrest if he leaves. (Photo by Jack Taylor/Getty Images) Getty Images Last Updated: Friday, Nov. 17, 9:55 a.m. The revelation that WikiLeaks secretly offered help to Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign, in a series of private Twitter messages sent to the candidate&#8217;s son Donald Trump Jr., gave ammunition to the group&#8217;s many detractors and also sparked anger from some longtime supporters of the organization and its founder, Julian Assange. One of the most high-profile dissenters was journalist Barrett Brown, whose crowdsourced investigations of hacked corporate documents later posted on WikiLeaks led to a prison sentence . Brown had a visceral reaction to the news, first reported by The Atlantic , that WikiLeaks had been advising the Trump campaign. In a series of tweets and Facebook videos, Brown accused Assange of having compromised &#8220;the movement&#8221; to expose corporate and government wrongdoing by acting as a covert political operative. Brown explained that he had defended WikiLeaks for releasing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee, &#8220;because it was an appropriate thing for a transparency org to do.&#8221; But, he added, &#8220;working with an authoritarian would-be leader to deceive the public is indefensible and disgusting.&#8221; He was particularly outraged by an Oct. 21, 2016 message , in which Assange had appealed to Trump Jr. to let WikiLeaks publish one or more of his father&#8217;s tax returns in order to make his group&#8217;s attacks on Hillary Clinton seem less biased. &#8220;If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,&#8221; the Assange-controlled @Wikileaks account suggested. &#8220;That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a &#8216;pro-Trump&#8217; &#8216;pro-Russia&#8217; source, which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with.&#8221; A screenshot of a direct message from the WikiLeaks Twitter account to Donald Trump Jr. As Brown pointed out in another tweet , it was all-caps exasperating that Assange was in this case &#8220;complaining about &#8216;slander&#8217; of being pro-Trump IN THE ACTUAL COURSE OF COLLABORATING WITH TRUMP.&#8221; The journalist, an Intercept contributor , whose work had been championed by WikiLeaks , also shared a link to a Reddit AMA conducted two days after the election in which WikiLeaks staff, including Assange&#8217;s longtime collaborator Sarah Harrison, had denied point-blank that they had collaborated with the Trump campaign. https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/930216747877240837 &#8220;The allegations that we have colluded with Trump, or any other candidate for that matter, or with Russia, are just groundless and false,&#8221; the staffers wrote then . &#8220;We were not publishing with a goal to get any specific candidate elected.&#8221; It is not surprising that Brown felt personally betrayed by Assange, since, as he explained on Facebook Tuesday night, &#8220;I went to prison because of my support for WikiLeaks.&#8221; Specifically, Brown said, the charges against him were related to his role in &#8220;operations to identify and punish members of the government and members of private companies that had been exposed by Anonymous hackers of my acquaintance, via email hacks, as having conspired to go after Assange, to go after WikiLeaks.&#8221; That sort of activism, dedicated to making public secret wrongdoing, Brown argued , is very different from &#8220;colluding with an authoritarian presidential campaign backed by actual Nazis while publicly denying it.&#8221; &#8220;Plainly,&#8221; he observed with bitterness , &#8220;the prospect of a Clinton in the White House was such an unimaginable nightmare scenario that all normal standards of truth and morality became moot and it became necessary to get people like Sebastian Gorka into the White House to establish order.&#8221; Before his private messages to Trump Jr. were leaked, Assange himself had categorically denied that he or WikiLeaks had been attacking Hillary Clinton to help elect Donald Trump. &#8220;This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election,&#8221; he wrote in a statement released on November 8 as Americans went to the polls. Even though Assange had by then transformed the WikiLeaks Twitter feed into a vehicle for smearing Clinton, he insisted that his work was journalistic in nature. &#8220;The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks &#8212; an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself,&#8221; Assange wrote. &#8220;Millions of Americans have pored over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment.&#8221; The same morning, WikiLeaks tweeted an attack on Clinton for not having driven her own car during her decades of public service. Clinton: out of touch, cronyistic, didn&#39;t drive a car in 35 years, flew all over the world but accomplished nothing https://t.co/dc2OjdPIII pic.twitter.com/P8yiYkD6bO &mdash; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 8, 2016 For Brown, and others who have been critical of Assange for using the platform of WikiLeaks to fight his own political and personal battles, his secret communication with the Trump campaign was damning because it revealed that he had been functioning more like a freelance political operative, doling out strategy and advice, than a journalist interested in obtaining and publishing information, concerned only with its accuracy. James Ball, a former WikiLeaks volunteer who has described the difficulty of working for someone who lies so much, was also appalled by one post-election message to Trump Jr., in which WikiLeaks suggested that, as a form of payback, it would be &#8220;helpful for your dad to suggest that Australia appoint Assange ambassador to DC.&#8221; That request for payback, on December 16, 2016, came three weeks after Trump&#8217;s father had called on the British government to make his friend Nigel Farage its ambassador. &#8220;This should be it, game over, end of it, for anyone who tries to suggest Assange looks out for anyone except himself,&#8221; Ball observed on Twitter . &#8220;That’s his cause, and plenty of good people have been played, badly.&#8221; There was also criticism from journalists like Chris Hayes of MSNBC, a network Assange accused of being, along with the New York Times, &#8220;the most biased source&#8221; in one note to Trump Jr. Pointing to a message from WikiLeaks sent on Election Day, advising Trump to refuse to concede and claim the election was rigged, Hayes asked how, exactly, offering that sort of political advice squared with the organization&#8217;s mission to promote transparency. A screenshot of a Nov. 8, 2016 DM to Donald Trump Jr. from WikiLeaks. Still, many of Assange&#8217;s most vocal supporters stuck with him, calling even secret communication with the Trump campaign to undermine Clinton entirely consistent with his vision of WikiLeaks as a sort of opposition research group , dedicated to &#8220; crushing bastards &#8221; by finding dirt in the servers of powerful individuals or organizations. As Raffi Khatchadourian explained in a New Yorker profile of the WikiLeaks founder in 2010, “Assange, despite his claims to scientific journalism, emphasized to me that his mission is to expose injustice, not to provide an even-handed record of events.” To Assange, Khatchadourian wrote, “Leaks were an instrument of information warfare.” One steadfast Assange ally was Kim Dotcom, founder of the shuttered file-sharing site MegaUpload, who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that the DNC emails had not been hacked by Russia, but provided to WikiLeaks by a young Democratic staffer named Seth Rich, who was subsequently murdered. Alluding to another entirely unsubstantiated allegation &#8212; that Clinton had once suggested killing Assange in a drone strike &#8212; Dotcom said that the WikiLeaks founder was merely part of a crowdsourced political operation that had successfully defeated the greater evil. I think what @JulianAssange wrote to @DonaldJTrumpJr is perfectly fine. Who’s surprised? He doesn’t like Hillary. She wanted to assassinate him with a drone for publishing the truth. And he’s fishing for information like any good editor. We wanted to prevent Hillary and we did! &mdash; Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) November 14, 2017 As it happens, one of the anti-Clinton rumors that WikiLeaks had urged Trump Jr. to &#8220;push&#8221; in an October 3, 2016 message was a tweet linking to that unsubstantiated allegation in an unsigned blog post citing anonymous sources. The blog post includes no documentation of the allegation, but the WikiLeaks tweet linking to it, which Trump Jr. told Assange he did share, included an excerpt from the blog post in which the type was styled to look like a leaked document. Hillary Clinton on Assange &quot;Can&#39;t we just drone this guy&quot; &#8212; report https://t.co/S7tPrl2QCZ pic.twitter.com/qy2EQBa48y &mdash; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 3, 2016 As Jesse Singal reported for New York magazine the day after that tweet was posted, and quickly went viral, there was no reason to believe that anonymous blogger had any source at all for the claim. The post does reference one email sent to Clinton, which was not leaked but archived by the State Department, in which one of her advisers said that a memo had been prepared of &#8220;possible legal and nonlegal strategies re wikileaks.&#8221; But, as Singal explained: &#8220;&#8216;non-legal&#8217; doesn’t mean the same thing as &#8216;illegal&#8217; — rather, it’s a fairly common term in government, and it can refer to basically anything that doesn’t directly involve the legal system. If you run Google searches over the websites of the White House or the State or Justice Departments, for example, those searches will yield a handful of hits in which the U.S. government speaks openly of &#8216;nonlegal&#8217; this or that, none of which are open admissions of lawbreaking.&#8221; Earlier in the campaign, the WikiLeaks Twitter feed had also shared video from 2010 of a Fox News pundit, Bob Beckel, calling for Assange&#8217;s assassination, with a caption that incorrectly identified him as a &#8220;Hillary Clinton strategist.&#8221; https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/763380671796678656 Beckel did not work for Clinton. He served in the State Department during the Carter administration, three decades before Clinton was secretary of state, and then ran Walter Mondale&#8217;s failed campaign for the presidency in 1984. While WikiLeaks has undoubtedly facilitated the release of information that is both true and important, it is Assange&#8217;s Trump-like willingness to traffic in such unsubstantiated rumors, conspiracy theories, and innuendo not supported by evidence that undermines his claim to be a disinterested publisher, not a political operative. This willingness to traffic in false or misleading information was very much in evidence during his work on behalf of Trump, and it is a consistent feature of Assange&#8217;s advocacy for other people and causes. During the final week of the Brexit campaign last year, Assange tried to undermine the credibility of a witness to the savage murder of a pro-European Union member of parliament, Jo Cox. In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, Brexit supporters like Assange were concerned that a wave of sympathy for the murdered MP could sway the vote. So they set out to contest evidence that the killing had been politically motivated. To that end, the WikiLeaks Twitter feed drew attention to the fact that one witness to the killing &#8212; who said he had heard the attacker shout &#8220;Britain First!&#8221; &#8212; might have belonged to a racist political group, the British National Party, whose membership rolls WikiLeaks had obtained. Within hours of the murder, WikiLeaks also shared a link to a conspiratorial post from the pro-Brexit Breitbart U.K., which speculated that the witness might have lied about what he heard as part of a feud among far-right racist groups. UK: &quot;witness&quot; who claimed MP slayer shouted &quot;Britain First!&quot; appears in BNP list https://t.co/pCSc1HOmqV #Brexit pic.twitter.com/qgylg91u3T &mdash; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 17, 2016 The next day, British police confirmed that the attacker told the arresting officers he was a &#8220;political activist&#8221; and had indeed shouted pro-Brexit phrases, including &#8220;Britain First,&#8221; during the murder. More recently, during the separatist protests in Catalonia he supported, Assange was forced to delete several fake or misleading images he had shared on Twitter &#8212; including one photograph he mistakenly said showed the head of Spanish military police kissing a flag at a demonstration, and another of Spanish police officers struggling with Catalans, which had been digitally altered to insert a Catalan independence flag .

In the final months of the 2016 presidential election, the WikiLeaks Twitter feed promoted not just its new publications, but also frequently referred to tabloid rumors &#8212; like old chestnuts about Hillary Clinton&#8217;s supposed &#8220;role in the death of White House counsel Vince Foster&#8221; &#8212; and wild conspiracy theories about her campaign chair taking part in bloody satanic rituals.

But mostly blood. https://t.co/gGPWFS3B2H pic.twitter.com/I43KiiraDh &mdash; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 We know now that, from late September on, Assange was also privately using that account to urge the candidate&#8217;s son to hype the mostly anodyne emails stolen from the account of campaign chair, John Podesta, as crucial evidence of Clinton&#8217;s unfitness for office. And it certainly looks like the campaign took his advice. On October 12, 2016, just 15 minutes after Assange told Trump Jr. that a new batch of Podesta emails had been released, with &#8220;many great stories the press are missing,&#8221; his father tweeted a complaint accusing &#8220;the dishonest media&#8221; of ignoring &#8220;incredible information provided by WikiLeaks.&#8221; Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system! &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2016 In the same message, Assange urged Trump Jr. to share a link he provided to the email database &#8212; wlsearch.tk &#8212; so &#8220;you guys can get all your followers digging through the content.&#8221; Two days later, Trump Jr. shared that link.

Instead, the hacked emails were used to reverse-engineer preposterous conspiracy theories, like the imaginary pedophilia scandal called Pizzagate, which WikiLeaks was still treating as real two months after the election. CBS Reality Check covers Pizzagate. https://t.co/KNaKp1XONR More: https://t.co/Sc1nFTAFgV &mdash; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 18, 2017 This is the real tragedy and menace of the public and private collaboration of WikiLeaks with Trump. An organization with a sterling reputation for providing the public with accurate information about secret government and corporate activities was used to launder conspiracy theories that helped elect a racist, sexual predator president of the United States. That might be a terrific result for people like Julian Assange, who see a dysfunctional, discredited White House as a way to undermine what they see as the real evil empire. For Americans condemned to live under Trump, particularly the most marginalized who, as Noam Chomsky has observed , will suffer the most from his cruelty, it is a far more troubling outcome. Update: Nov. 16, 2017, 8:55 a.m. Some supporters of Julian Assange have argued that the October 21 direct message that so infuriated Barrett Brown &#8212; in which Assange argued that it would be good for the Trump campaign to allow WikiLeaks to publish one or more of Donald Trump&#8217;s tax returns &#8212; merely showed the publisher trying to obtain private material of public interest. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the proposal, explicitly presented as a way for WikiLeaks to seem to be less &#8220;pro-Trump,&#8221; would have compromised the organization&#8217;s principles, by disguising material released by a political campaign as a leak obtained from a whistleblower. It is also important to remember what was happening in the news at that time. Three weeks before WikiLeaks solicited Trump&#8217;s tax information, an anonymous source mailed three pages from Trump&#8217;s 1995 tax return to The New York Times, which published an analysis showing that Trump had used entirely legal means to avoid paying federal taxes. Had the Trump campaign provided WikiLeaks with another old return, it is possible that the organization could have published tax information that would not have damaged Trump politically, but would have misled its readers into believing that the organization was working to undermine Trump as well as Clinton. After Trump took office, a page from his 2005 tax return, showing that he had paid millions in taxes that year, was mailed anonymously to David Cay Johnston . The reporter speculated that the source could have been Trump himself, seeking to undercut the widespread assumption that there is embarrassing information contained in the more recent tax returns he broke with precedent to keep secret. &#8220;Donald,&#8221; Johnston told Rachel Maddow , &#8220;has a long history of leaking material about himself when he thinks it&#8217;s in his interest.&#8221; It is also worth noting that this offer to help Trump came less than two weeks after The Washington Post had thrown the campaign into crisis, by revealing that the candidate had boasted of sexual assault in comments recorded during the taping of an &#8220;Access Hollywood&#8221; episode in 2005. The recording caught Trump saying that, &#8220;when you&#8217;re a star,&#8221; you can &#8220;do anything&#8221; to women, even &#8220;grab them by the pussy.&#8221; WikiLeaks released its first batch of emails hacked from Clinton&#8217;s campaign chairman, John Podesta, less than an hour after that report was published.

LESSWRONG LW Login Evolutionary Psychology Philosophy Personal Blog 37 Accelerate without humanity: Summary of Nick Land&#x27;s philosophy by Yuxi_Liu 16th Jun 2019 15 min read 24 37 I took note of the philosopher Nick Land from reading about posthumanism on Wikipedia . A more pessimistic alternative to transhumanism in which humans will not be enhanced, but rather eventually replaced by artificial intelligences. Some philosophers, including Nick Land, promote the view that humans should embrace and accept their eventual demise. This is related to the view of ""cosmism"", which supports the building of strong artificial intelligence even if it may entail the end of humanity, as in their view it ""would be a cosmic tragedy if humanity freezes evolution at the puny human level"". I was intrigued by such boldness, so I read more. And turns out Nick Land's writing is sometimes easy to read but most of the times extremely hard to read, and probably garbage. I wrote this post so that you don't have to waste time wading through the garbage, looking for fragments of good poetry. Nothing human makes it out of the near-future. -- Nick Land First of all, Nick Land was obsessed with hating Kant, loving Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari and their philosophical style (called schizoanalysis , related to schizophrenia). He likes to think about the world from very nonhuman viewpoints, such as other animals, robots, computers, machines that humans made, earth, the universe, etc. He likes capitalism and technological revolution, as fast as possible, without regard for its goodness. Recently there's some mainstream reports on his philosophy of Neoreactionism ("" Dark Enlightenment ""), the idea that democracy sucks and monarchy/CEO-president works better. This philosophy has gained a bit of following, but uninteresting to me, so we won't review that. I'd simply note that the phrase ""Dark Enlightenment"" really should be ""Delightenment"". Really missing out such a pun. Schizoanalysis The idea of schizoanalysis just means that there's a lot of ways to make a theory about the world, and make philosophies, and there's no one way to do it, and further, there could be genuine conflicts that cannot be resolved by appealing to a higher standard. In mathematics, there's some fringe movement of this style. Most mathematicians are in favor of logical consistency, but some are okay with controlled inconsistency ( paraconsistency ). Most mathematicians are in favor of using infinities, but some are finitists who think that infinities don't exist, and a few are ultrafinitists who think that there are finite large numbers (such as e^{e^{10}}) that can be assumed to not exist . Coincidentally, these fringe mathematicians tend to be obnoxious and argumentative (Doron Zeilberger is a prominent example). Maybe there's such a thing as an ""obnoxious fringe personality""... Schizoanalysis uses an analogy for how to think about theories: the rhizome . A rhizome is a bunch of underground roots, touching each other in a messy network. This is in contrast to a tree, from a big trunk going up to little branches. Traditionally, stories about the world are told like a tree: there's a great principle of the world: be it God, Existentialism, or Absurdism, and the story gets more and more details as it explains the smaller things like how to treat other people. But maybe there are many stories just messed up and knotted, without any way to unify them in a single principle. I make stories about Infinities and you about Ultrafinitism and there's no way to unify us. Two powerful countries with incompatible philosophies go to war, unable to unify their stories. Really obscure style Kant is hard enough, Deleuze and Guattari's books are unreadable (I tried). Nick Land, being immersed in such kinds of books, often wrote in the same extreme obscure style. For example, Machinic Desire (1992) : The transcendental unconscious is the auto-construction of the real, the production of production, so that for schizoanalysis there is the real exactly in so far as it is built. Production is production of the real, not merely of representation, and unlike Kantian production, the desiring production of Deleuze/Guattari is not qualified by humanity (it is not a matter of what things are like for us)... Don't bother trying to understand that. A big part of reading philosophy is to ignore real nonsense while still spending time on apparent nonsense that is actually sensible. Non-human viewpoints Rats Nick Land uses schizoanalysis by considering very non-human viewpoints. For example, he once gave a talk about studying the Black Death from the perspective of rats : ""Putting the Rat back Into Rationality"", in which he argued that, rather than seeing death as an event that happened at a particular time to an individual, we should look at it from the perspectives of the rats carrying the Black Death into Europe; that is, as a world-encircling swarm... An older professor tried to get his head round this idea: “How might we locate this description within human experience?” he asked. Nick told him that human experience was, of course, worthy of study, but only as much as, say, the experience of sea slugs: “I don’t see why it should receive any special priority.” Earth Another paper/fiction, Barker Speaks , develops the theory of ""geotrauma"", a story about how the Earth feels, and it feels endless PAIN. This is my most favorite story so far, just because it's easy to picture (especially if you know Gaia theory ). Deleuze and Guattari ask: Who does the Earth think it is?... during the Hadean epoch, the earth was kept in a state of superheated molten slag [from asteroid impacts]... the terrestrial surface cooled, due to the radiation of heat into space... During the ensuing – Archaen – epoch the molten core was buried within a crustal shell, producing an insulated reservoir of primal exogeneous trauma, the geocosmic motor of terrestrial transmutation... It’s all there: anorganic memory, plutonic looping of external collisions into interior content, impersonal trauma as drive-mechanism. Basically, do psychoanalysis on geology. The center of the earth is full of heat, and tension, leftovers from its early pains of being hit by asteroids. This trauma is being expressed in geological phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes, and continental drifts. Fast forward seismology and you hear the earth scream. Further, even biological creatures should be thought of as one kind of geological phenomenon. This isn't complete nonsense, considering that we have possible clay-life earlier on Earth, and the fact that biological lifeforms have shaped geological strata. Geotrauma is an ongoing process, whose tension is continually expressed – partially frozen – in biological organization. In this story, biological creatures are just one way for Earth to express its trauma. We are the skin-crawls, manifestations of Earth's inner suffering. Machinic desires Nick Land talks a lot about cyborgs, AI, and machinic desire/desiring machines. The idea is that humans, animals, anything that has desires, are machines behaving as if they have true desires. It's not necessary for there to be deep reasons behind wanting to do something. A creature desires something (like sugar) because it's constructed to seek it. Humans, animals, computers, cyborgs, they are all desiring machines. Some are better at achieving their desires, but there's no way to judge who has a superior/inferior desire. Acceleration and capitalism Nick Land is obsessed with progress and capitalism. Progress here seems to be defined by increasing complexity, increased number of machines, and numbers going up. I have some sympathies with this idea, but at the same time is also very uncomfortable with it. Idle game of the whole universe The easiest way to summarize accelerationism seems to be: The universe should be consumed into an idle game. Think of Cookie Clicker. You click to make a number go up and enslave grandmas and build factories to make more cookies, with which to buy more cookie makers. It's the purest form of capitalism: You never get to consume any cookies, and all that's produced is reinvested to produce more. You don't have any friends, you consume the whole universe to make cookies, and that's all there is. The number of cookies accelerates exponentially, and you feel happy and empty and can't stop going anyway. Accelerationism sees an idle game universe as good, or the least bad of all choices. Previous work The idea that capitalism is a great innovative, destructive force is nothing new. Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto (1848) already states : Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind. The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere. The idea that things are changing way too fast is not new either, Future Shock (1970) , by Alvin and Heidi Toffler is one famous book that argues that the modern area is changing so fast that it's causing many kinds of psychological stress on people. The book is quite accurate in its diagnosis, and its list of features of modern society are so common sense as to be banal (I yawned). Accelerationism Capitalism has many criticisms, such as turning people into products, giving prices to things that shouldn't have a price, etc. The idea of accelerationism is that we should keep capitalism going, keep technology going, go with the flow of technology even if it destroys humanity and everything we love. After all, there's no alternative. And why resist? It's glorious to burn up like a shooting star, like the fuel of a rocket that accelerates into empty space. Capitalism’s destructive force is picked up in the 1990s by the British philosopher Nick Land. In a series of incendiary essays, Land celebrates absolute deterritorialization as liberation—even (or above all) to the point of total disintegration and death... He sees its absolute, violently destructive speed as an alien force that should be welcomed and celebrated. Or just like Facebook said: Move fast and break things. Note: some people use the word ""accelerationalism"" in a different sense, that capitalism is bad, but the only way to escape capitalism is to make it go faster until it arrives at its bitter end, then we can escape. Kind of like diving into the center of a black hole and hoping that we'll escape into a better universe. I'm not interested in this sense of accelerationalism. This is similar in spirit to cosmism, as a philosophy against humanism, detailed in The Artilect War (2005), by Hugo de Garis. The basic idea is simple though. There are the Terrans, or the humanists, who prefer to keep humans in control, and there are the Cosmists, who wants to keep the progress of intelligence expansion going, and fulfill a kind of cosmic destiny. I think humanity should build these godlike supercreatures with intellectual capacities trillion of trillions of trillions times above our levels. I think it would be a cosmic tragedy if humanity freezes evolution at the puny human level. Technological determinism Technology is not neutral. It's a mere ""tool"", but even tools have desires and tendencies, controlling the very users who controls the tools. This is an ancient idea, going way back to Socrates's criticism of writing as affecting the memories of its users. Kevin Kelly is a modern thinker who wrote a book What Technology Wants (2010) , and his idea is that the technologies are very much not neutral, and can even be thought of as something alive , with its own goals. The future of earth is very much determined by how this ecosystem of technologies evolves. The cars are mechanical horses that wants you to build more roads so that it can go to more places. In order to encourage you to make more roads, it allows you to sit in them and take you everywhere. Thus proven itself useful, the cars entice you to build more roads. And that's how in just 100 years, there are suddenly these thin, gray, flat concrete things called ""roads"" everywhere on earth. The Internet want to expand, enticing you to join by providing so much stuff there. Junk food wants to be eaten, and diet books want you to get fat. Books want you to make more printing machines, and printing machines want you to read more books. This Texan hotel, for instance, was an entirely virtual construction, ones and zeros embedded in a set of chips. And yet, the hotel direly wanted to exist. It would become very beautiful, and it was already very smart. It could sweet-talk itself into physical existence from random piles of raw materials. Oscar lugged the self-declared cornerstone to the corner of the southern wall. ""I belong here,"" the cornerstone declared. ""Put mortar on me."" Oscar picked up a trowel. ""I'm the tool for the mortar,"" the little trowel squeaked cheerfully. Distraction (1998), by Bruce Sterling. Nick Land takes this to an extreme. Machinic desire can seem a little inhuman, as it rips up political cultures, deletes traditions, dissolves subjectivities, and hacks through security apparatuses, tracking a soulless tropism to zero control. This is because what appears to humanity as the history of capitalism is an invasion from the future by an artificial intelligent space that must assemble itself entirely from its enemy's resources. It means something like this: our world, with its cars, finances, AI, and other industrial technologies, has a clear goal of its own: a future dominated by more of upgraded versions of these technologies, with humans becoming extinct or irrelevant. An inevitable AI apocalypse. It's called an invasion from the future, because this inhuman future is not yet here, but we already feel like we are being pulled towards it, as if someone has sent agents back in time to ensure humans do not mess up this plan. It's like the plot of Terminator. Materialistic nihilism No one could ever ‘be’ a libidinal materialist. This is a ‘doctrine’ that can only be suffered as an abomination, a jangling of the nerves, a combustion of articulate reason, and a nauseating rage of thought. It is a hyperlepsy of the central nervous-system, ruining the body’s adaptive regimes, and consuming its reserves in rhythmic convulsions that are not only futile, but devastating... An aged philosopher is either a monster of stamina or a charlatan. What matters is the violent impulse to escape that gives this book its title. The thirst for annihilation. This section is based on his book The Thirst for Annihilation (1992) that I have been reading on and off sometimes. This book is a collection of essays on George Bataille , a very weird writer that I encountered twice. The first time, I encountered him during my research on lingchi , as he wrote about it in a really hard to read book ( Tears of Eros ) that sexualizes violence. The second time, it was in this book by Nick Land. Basically, George Bataille wrote a lot, and his writing about materialistic nihilism, death, shit, vomit, garbage, and all that's ugly about life. (He also wrote a lot of sexual fetishes, but it's not very interesting.) He wrote about them repetitively, not because he wanted to repeat himself a lot, but because to write was to howl in pain. We scream when we are burnt, no matter how many times it happens. Bataille wrote ugly despair whenever ugly despair hit his brain like a tsunami. The meaning of life is to waste energy Bataille thought Life is evil and ugly and meaningless. Life doesn't try to conserve energy, instead, life is about wasting energy. The Sun is a giant source of energy, and all the excess energy has to be used up somehow... hence life! Life appears when the blind materials of earth become overheated by all the energy of the sun, and shaken into more and more complicated shapes, in order to consume all the excess energy. All energy must ultimately be spent pointlessly and unreservedly, the only questions being where, when, and in whose name... Bataille interprets all natural and cultural development upon the earth to be side-effects of the evolution of death, because it is only in death that life becomes an echo of the sun, realizing its inevitable destiny, which is pure loss. The Sun is the source of energy. All the energy ends up being wasted, turned to ""zero"", nothing. Life is a thin, fragile, and very complex middle-layer between the Sun and the zero. Life is ejected from the energy-blank and smeared as a crust upon chaotic zero, a mold upon death. This crust is also a maze - a complex exit back to the energy base-line - and the complexity of the maze is life trying to escape from out of itself... life is itself the maze of its route to death... Nick Land's ""maze"" means something like this: Life is really simple: it's about wasting energy. But life is anything but simple, since life has developed more and more complicated ways to waste energy. In order to waste the maximal amount of energy, it's necessary that life doesn't start wasting energy immaturely (by, for example, committing suicide), but accumulate and grow, before it starts to massively waste energy (by, for example, making babies, then dying and turning into a warm pool of rotten wasted energy). Paradoxically, in order to waste a lot of energy, life must not waste energy immediately, and so it has to stay alive for quite a while. Thus, life has become more and more complicated, like a maze that keeps growing, apparently wandering further and further away from death, even though it is simply preparing for even more massive wasting of energy later. This is probably the reason why people fear death, and also fear immortality. They fear death, because they need to accumulate energy. They fear immortality, because they need to waste all the energy at the end of life. An endless life defeats the purpose of life: to waste a lot of energy. Perhaps a good illustration of this idea is a time-lapse video of slime molds . They even look like mazes! My comments on the theory of life as energy-waster Scientifically, I think this is stupid. But it's a good story, and has some kernels of truth. When Darwinism first became famous, many people thought it was nonsense, because it's just so unlikely that life could emerge in the first place. Sure, once simple life emerges, evolution can start and allow more complicated lifeforms to appear, but why did simple life appear from purely lifeless matter? This thinking has changed among some scientists. There are theories that say that life, far from being a lucky accident, is in fact inevitable by the laws of physics. Life is in fact ""meant"" to waste solar energy. This was explicitly proposed in Life as a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics (1994), by E.D.Schneider, J.J.Kay: We argue that as ecosystems grow and develop, they should increase their total dissipation, develop more complex structures with more energy flow, increase their cycling activity, develop greater diversity and generate more hierarchical levels, all to abet energy degradation. Species which survive in ecosystems are those that funnel energy into their own production and reproduction and contribute to autocatalytic processes which increase the total dissipation of the ecosystem. In short, ecosystems develop in ways which systematically increase their ability to degrade the incoming solar energy. This theory was given a more mathematical treatment in Statistical Physics of Self-Replication (2012) by Jeremy England, where it's proposed that self-replication, which is the fundamental part of life, is fueled by entropy. This paper has generated a lot of publicity, for it makes the ideas sketched above mathematically precise. As reported in First Support for a Physics Theory of Life (2017) : It’s not easy for a group of atoms to unlock and burn chemical energy. To perform this function, the atoms must be arranged in a highly unusual form. According to England, the very existence of a form-function relationship “implies that there’s a challenge presented by the environment that we see the structure of the system as meeting.” Think of what the humans are doing as they dig up coals and oils and burn them? They are having fun, sure, but from a thermodynamic point of view, they are turning high-quality, useful chemical energy into low-quality, useless heat. If oil and coal are left buried, they would stay undisturbed for millions of years. With human intervention, all the useful energy is turned into useless energy in a hundred years. Humans perhaps are the solution to the problem of consuming fossil energy. And by analogy, perhaps life is the solution to the problem of consuming solar energy. As another analogy, think of a bottle of water with its cap unscrewed and turned upside down. Water flows out, to turn its gravitational energy into kinetic energy, and then turn into the useless energy of heat after it splashes into the ground. A big vortex forms in the bottle, and with that vortex, water flows out that much faster. The beautiful vortexes of steam rising from a cup of hot coffee are similar: ordered structures arising to turn the useful temperature difference (you can run a heat engine with that!) between the coffee and the air, into a useless temperature equality, as fast as possible. A bacterium is a little vortex for turning sugar into heat. But how and why do atoms acquire the particular form and function of a bacterium, with its optimal configuration for consuming chemical energy? England hypothesizes that it’s a natural outcome of thermodynamics in far-from-equilibrium systems. Coffee cools down because nothing is heating it up, but England’s calculations suggested that groups of atoms that are driven by external energy sources can behave differently: They tend to start tapping into those energy sources, aligning and rearranging so as to better absorb the energy and dissipate it as heat. He further showed that this statistical tendency to dissipate energy might foster self-replication. (As he explained it in 2014, “A great way of dissipating more is to make more copies of yourself.”) England sees life, and its extraordinary confluence of form and function, as the ultimate outcome of dissipation-driven adaptation and self-replication. Perhaps pockets of low-entropy life emerged only to increase the entropy of the universe at the fastest possible rate. Perhaps Bataille's desperate theory of life isn't that insane, after all.

Most prominently, a first treatment of Land's thought in this space should deal with this: http://www.xenosystems.net/against-orthogonality/ (more here: http://www.xenosystems.net/stupid-monsters/ ), which is neither obscure, nor irrelevant. Reply [ - ] mako yass 6y 3 0 against orthogonality is interesting the anti-orthogonalist position [my position] is therefore that Omohundro drives [general instrumental goals] exhaust the domain of real purposes . Nature has never generated a terminal value except through hypertrophy of an instrumental value. To look outside nature for sovereign purposes is not an undertaking compatible with techno-scientific integrity I remember being a young organism, struggling to answer the question, what&#x27;s the point, why do we exist. We all know what it is now, people tried to tell me, &quot;to survive and reproduce&quot;, but that answer didn&#x27;t resonate with any part of my being. They&#x27;d tell me what I was, and I wouldn&#x27;t even recognise it as familiar. If our goals are hypertrophied versions of evolution&#x27;s instrumental goals, I&#x27;m fairly sure they&#x27;re going to stay fairly hypertrophied, maybe forever, and we should probably get used to it. Any intelligence using itself to improve itself will out-compete one that directs itself towards any other goals whatsoever Unless the ones with goals have more power, and can establish a stable monopoly on power (they do, and they might) Can Nick Land at least conceive of a hypothetical universe where a faction fighting for non-omohudro values ended up winning, (and then presumably, using the energy they won to have a big non-omohundro value party that lasts until the heat death of the universe) is it that he just think that humans in particular, in their current configuration, are not strong enough for our story to end that way? Reply [ - ] Uriel Fiori 6y 1 0 Unless the ones with goals have more power, and can establish a stable monopoly on power (they do, and they might) more than the ones optimizing for increasing their power? i find it doubtful. Reply [ - ] mako yass 6y 1 0 An agency can put its end-goals away for later, without pursuing them immediately, save them until it has its monopoly. It&#x27;s not that difficult to imagine. Maybe an argument will come along that it&#x27;s just too hard to make a self-improving agency with a goal more complex than &quot;understand your surroundings and keep yourself in motion&quot;, but it&#x27;s a hell of a thing to settle for. Reply [ - ] spkoc 5y 2 0 Those links were really interesting! My take them: any truly intelligent paperclip maximizer would not make any paperclips until it had under its control as much of the universe as it feasibly could. Or it&apos;d turn into paperclips only those parts of its domain that could no longer help it expand its sphere of influence. Basically a true paperclip maximizer would almost certainly not start turning the Earth into paperclips, since it would understand that using the Earth as a jumping off point for galactic colonization will produce many more paperclips in the long run. This seems like a really effective counter to the naive presentation of the idiot paperclip maximizer. Has it been addressed and countered in turn anywhere? I guess this self-improving and expanding maximizer would still view humans instrumentally, but it might still want to use humans as tools for it&apos;s expansion. And indeed, depending on the trade-offs of neurologically modifying humans for obedience(or whatever), it might even leave the base stock more or less alone to the forces of evolution. It becomes more of Quixotic Crusader for Paperclips, with a suicide pact as part of the ideology at the very end of the crusade(once the universe is ours we all turn into paperclips). Delayed gratification taken to cosmic extremes. Reply [ - ] Uriel Fiori 5y 1 0 Yes, if the paperclipper is thought to be ever more intelligent, it's end-goal could be any - and it's likely it would see it's own capability improvement as the primary goal (""the better I am, the more paperclips are produced"") etc. Reply [ - ] Chris_Leong 6y 2 0 I didn't systematically review his work, just clicked on random articles to see how much value I could extract. Feel free to look me to any reasonable accessible articles. Reply [ - ] Uriel Fiori 6y 1 0 well, any answer to the thread in the two I linked above would already be really interesting. his new book on Bitcoin is really good too: http://www.uf-blog.net/crypto-current-000/ Reply [ - ] moridinamael 6y 5 0 The part about wasting energy seems quite silly. The universe has a fixed amount of mass-energy, so presumably when he talks about wasting energy, what he means is taking advantage of energy gradients. Energy gradients will always and everywhere eventually wind down toward entropy on their own without help, so life isn&#x27;t even doing anything novel here. It&#x27;s not like the sun stops radiating out energy if life isn&#x27;t there to absorb photons. The observation that life takes advantage of concentration pockets of energy and thus this is the &quot;purpose&quot; of life is just sophistry. It deserves to be taken about as seriously as George Carlin&#x27;s joke that humans were created because Mother Nature wanted plastic and didn&#x27;t know how to make it. Reply [ - ] Yuxi_Liu 6y * 3 0 I thought it was clear even to them that ""wasting"" energy meant using up usable energy into useless forms. It is not just sophistry. If it turns out to be the fundamental feature of life (like how the laws of thermodynamics are for heat machines), then it would be predictive of the future activities of life. In particular, the aestivation hypothesis would be seriously threatened. This is analogous to prediction that population would always go Malthulsian except in non-equilibrium situations. It's not a value/moral judgment, but an attempt to find general laws of life that can be used to predict the future. Reply [ - ] moridinamael 6y 1 0 Perhaps tautology is a better word than sophistry. Of course turning usable energy into unusable forms is a fundamental feature of life; it&#x27;s a fundamental feature of everything to which the laws of thermodynamics apply. It&#x27;d be equally meaningless to say that using up useful energy is a fundamental property of stars, and that the purpose of stars is to waste energy. It&#x27;s just something that stars do, because of the way the universe is set up. It&#x27;s a descriptive observation. It&#x27;s only predictive insofar as you would predict that life will probably only continue to exist where there are energy gradients. Reply [ - ] Yuxi_Liu 6y 3 0 Stars follow the laws of thermodynamics. This observation is more predictive than you make it out to be, once it is quantified. The theory of thermodynamics of life is more than just a statement that life is constrained by thermodynamics in the boring sense. I'm especially interested in this statement: In short, ecosystems develop in ways which systematically increase their ability to degrade the incoming solar energy. If this is true, then it can be used to predict what kinds of future life would be like. It would not be any kind of life, but life that can capture more solar energy and convert it into low-temperature heat at a faster rate. Unfortunately my thermodynamics is not good enough to actually read the papers. The talk of ""purpose"" seems to cause great confusion. I don't mean it for any value judgment (I generally avoid value judgments and use it as a last resort). ""Purpose"" is just a metaphor, just like talk of the ""purpose of evolution"". It helps me understand and predict. Reply [ - ] yegorevolbio 4y 1 0 Life in itself most probably had occured in places with heat energy gradient (in termal vents), henceforth catalysis developed by chemical evolution and &quot;life&quot; just began to use those gradients more efficiently and maybe create and utilize its own gradients Reply [ - ] areiamus 6y 4 0 The best post I have read this quarter. Thank you for wading through these books and filtering the inanity from the insanity. It was a real waste of energy for both of us (you to research and write; me to read). Excellent work! Reply [ - ] Yuxi_Liu 6y 1 0 What is a quarter? 1/4 of a year? Reply [ - ] areiamus 5y 1 0 Yes. It was meant to imply a comparison set against which your post should be considered - e.g., if I read about 1-10 articles like yours every day, then your post was among the best of about 100-1000 (possibly an exaggeration for effect). Reply [ - ] Chris_Leong 6y 3 0 Thanks for writing this; I've briefly attempted looking at his ideas, but most of it is unreadable. Most of his remaining ideas seem at least somewhat mystical, which makes me skeptical, but it's useful to know! Reply [ - ] Yuxi_Liu 6y 2 0 I will review more posthumanism, things like Dark Ecology, Object-Oriented Ontology, and such. [According to dark ecology,] we must obliterate the false opposition between nature and people... the idea of nature itself is a damaging construct, and that humans (with their microbial biomass) are always already nonhuman. Object-Oriented Ontology... rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects Somewhat independently of transhumanism, posthumanism developed in a more philosophical and less scientific style in the liberal arts department, with different viewpoints, often ambiguous and not at all happy. posthumanism... refers to the contemporary critical turn away from Enlightenment humanism... a rejection of familiar Cartesian dualisms such as self/other, human/animal, and mind/body... My personal thought is that the future is weird, beyond happy or sad, good or evil. Transhumanism is too intent on good and evil, and from what I've read so far, posthumanism uses less human value judgments. As such, posthuman thoughts would be essential for an accurate prediction of the future. Solaris (1972) seems like a good story illustration of posthumanism. The peculiarity of those phenomena seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the Solarian Ocean is beyond the reach of human beings. Reply [ - ] Aiyen 6y 4 0 This seems wrong. The second law of thermodynamics isn&#x27;t magic; it&#x27;s simply the fact that when you have categories with many possible states that fit in them, and categories with only a few states that count, jumping randomly from state to state will tend to put you in the larger categories. Hence melting-arrange atoms randomly and it&#x27;s more likely that you&#x27;ll end up in a jumble than in one of the few arrangements that permit solidity. Hence heat equalizing-the kinetic energy of thermal motion can spread out in many ways, but remain concentrated in only a few; thus it tends to spread out. You can call that the universe hating order if you like, but it&#x27;s a well-understood process that operates purely through small targets being harder to hit; not through a force actively pushing us towards chaos, making particles zig when they otherwise would have zagged so as to create more disorder. This being the case, claiming that life exists for the purpose of wasting energy seems absurd. Evolution appears to explain the existence of life, and it is not an entropic process. Positing anything else being behind it requires evidence, something about life that evolution doesn&#x27;t explain and entropy-driven life would. Also, remember, entropy doesn&#x27;t think ahead. It is purely the difficulty of hitting small targets; a bullet isn&#x27;t going to &#x27;decide&#x27; to swerve into a bull&#x27;s eye as part of a plan to miss more later! It would be very strange if this could somehow mold us into fearing both death and immortality as part of a plan to gather as much energy as we could, then waste it through our deaths. This seems like academics seeking to be edgy much more than a coherent explanation of biology. As for transhumanism being overly interested in good or evil, what would you suggest we do instead? It&#x27;s rather self-defeating to suggest that losing interest in goodness would be a good idea. Reply [ - ] mako yass 6y 2 0 Had some thoughts. I&#x27;ll start with the entropy thing. Anything that happens in a physics complex enough to support life constitutes transitioning energy to entropy . ANYTHING. That process does not draw a distinction between living and non-living, between entropy-optimising agency and a beauty-optimising agency. If you look at life, and only see spending energy , then you know as little as it is possible to know about which part of the universe count as life, or how it will behave. Humans do want to spend energy, but they don&#x27;t really care how fast it happens, or whether it ever concludes. Humans really care about the things that happen along the way. Some people seem to become nihilistic in the face of the inevitability of life&#x27;s eventual end. Because the end is going to be the same no matter what we do, they think, it doesn&#x27;t matter what happens along the way. I&#x27;m of the belief that a healthy psyche tries to rescue its utility function . When our conception the substance of essential good seems to disappear from our improved worldmodel, when we find that the essential good thing we were optimising can&#x27;t really exist, we must have some method for locating the closest counterpart to that essence of good in our new, improved worldmodel. We must know what it means to continue. We must have a way of rescuing the utility function. It sometimes seems as if Nick Land doesn&#x27;t have that. A person finds out that the world is much worse and weirder than he thought. He repeats that kind of improvement several times (he&#x27;s uniquely good at it). He expects that it&#x27;s never going to end. He gets tired of burying stillborn ideals. Instead of developing a robust notion of good that can survive bad news and paradigm shifts, he cuts out his heart and stops having any notion of good at all. He&#x27;s safe now. Philosophy can&#x27;t hurt him any more. That&#x27;s a cynical take. For the sake of balance: My distant steelman of Nick Land is that maybe he sees the role of philosophy as being to get us over as many future shocks as possible as quickly as possible to get us situated in the bad weird what will be , and only once we&#x27;re done with that can we start talking about what should be . Only then can we place a target that wont soon disappear. And the thing about that is it takes a long time, and we&#x27;re still not finished, so we still can&#x27;t start to Should. I couldn&#x27;t yet disagree with that. I believe I&#x27;m fairly well situated in the world, perhaps my model wont shatter again, in any traumatic way, but it&#x27;s clear to me that my praxis is taking a while to catch up with my model. We are still doing things that don&#x27;t make a lot of sense, in light of the weird, bad world. Perhaps we need to be a lot better at relinquishing the instrumental values we inherited from a culture adapted to a nicer world. Reply [ - ] Gurkenglas 6y 0 0 We could simulate a video-game physics where energy and entropy are not a concern, and populate it with players. Therefore, not every physics complex enough to support life has anything to do with energy and entropy. Reply [ - ] kausality 5y 1 0 Great summary with interesting comments. However I have a doubt: The author posits that the goal of life is to dissipate solar energy. Say by living a life, we are dissipating solar energy but the things we do while living just &quot;transforms&quot; the energy into something else but the net energy remains constant. If we drop water on the floor then it gets dissipated into heat but the net energy is same in the universe with that water just changing its state. From the perspective of earth, it is definately throwing up &quot;extra&quot; energy it can&apos;t consume. From the perspective of universe, the energy remains constant. So perhaps a better way to think about this is that life is an interplay of energies going on ad-infinitum. This line of thinking implies that life is not a big conspiracy for &quot;wasting&quot; solar energy. It is more like a creative game where life and death have no meaning in itself but only as an inevitable infinite cosmic game. It surely doesn&apos;t sound so pessimistic this way. Reply [ - ] ASK 6y 1 0 While reading this over the last couple days I experienced multiple synchronicities and validations of my expanding appreciation for Nick Land, my personal strange attractor of the last few months. I was even mulling over one of my favorite analogies earlier today, only to return to find my civilization-as-slime-mold being articulated by yourself after the fact. So getting to the bit about the invasion from the future was especially poignant. Turns out I&#x27;ve been fashioning myself a cosmist without ever having heard of it. Great job! Every line spoke volumes to me. Yours in entropy and sun worship, ASK Reply [ - ] Philomela de Silentio 6y 0 0 This is a superficial and facile reading of Land - his thinking delves far deeper than these surface readings suggest. Firstly, I would recommend aquainting yourself with the philosophical history - actually thinking through the ""hard"" writings of Bataille and Deleuze &amp; Guatarri, for example. The latter two are certainly ideomatic, but they are far from unreadable. It just takes mire effort than reading some articles to grasp their different amd differentiating mode of thinking. Without a firm grasp of D &amp; G, the complexities of Land will seem like nonsense, which it certainly is not. It is just striking in its refusal of a fundamental humanism that we take for granted as a biological will to live, or what he referred to as ""the human security system."" Along with this, machinic-desire comes from D &amp; G, and it does not suggest that machines or cars have their own will and desires. Until AI is sufficiently realized, such an idea remains idiotic. It is not what Land, or D &amp; G for that matter, means to say at all. Also, the quotation that you cite as not worth making sense of, as nonsense, in fact makes perfect sense if you understand the terminology. If you read Kant and Deleuze you would be able to see that what Land is writing about there is essential to understanding his base materialism and the concept of a materialist synthesis. This is not Land's failing, but your own. The internet is a valuable tool for disseminating thought, but it also renders fertile ground for the proliferation of silly misinterpretations passed off as valid. If you want to get into Land, or any writer, go to the source - be wary of secondary interpretations, especially those written by unknown aliases of cybernetic untracability. Who knows - they might just be a mask of AxSys... Reply Moderation Log More from Yuxi_Liu View more Curated and popular this week 24 Comments",43198

The Intellectual Origins of Surveillance Tech,Outsider Theory,2020-01-01,https://outsidertheory.com/the-intellectual-origins-of-surveillance-tech/,"The Intellectual Origins of Surveillance Tech - OUTSIDER THEORY Skip to the content Search OUTSIDER THEORY theory on the outside, theory of the outside, outside of the theory Menu About Podcast Newsletter Contact Search Search for: Close search Close Menu About Podcast Newsletter Contact Categories Technology Theory The Intellectual Origins of Surveillance Tech The philosophical backgrounds of Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp and his co-founder Peter Thiel offer surprising insights into the company&#8217;s guiding ethos. Post author By Geoff Shullenberger Post date July 17, 2020 Not long ago I responded to a tweet that was making the rounds: Peter Thiel was inspired to create Palantir in part by studying with René Girard, and reading Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss. https://t.co/1kd8qxGF2K &mdash; Geoff Shullenberger (@g_shullenberger) May 12, 2020 My response was far less popular (374 likes) than the original tweet (6.5 likes), despite being obviously more correct. (Sigh.) Clearly, the people of twitter dot com prefer more comforting narratives about the humanities. Nevertheless, the exploration of what they have contributed to the creation of the massive surveillance apparatus in which we all exist must continue. Palantir Technologies, less famous than Paypal, Facebook, or other Thiel-associated enterprises, but just as notable, takes its name from the &#8220;seeing stones&#8221; in Tolkien&#8217;s Lord of the Rings. It specializes in big data analytics, and contracts with intelligence and defense agencies on digital surveillance projects. It is often cited as the source of the intel that allowed the US to find Osama bin Laden. One strong piece of evidence for my claim that Thiel&#8217;s humanities background informed the creation of Palantir is his essay &#8220;The Straussian Moment,&#8221; first presented as a conference paper in 2004, then published in 2007 in the volume Politics and Apocalypse . Thiel founded Palantir in 2003-4, so the essay was composed in exactly the same period in his career when he was establishing the company. The essay&#8217;s title tells us explicitly how he was thinking about the early 2000s historical moment: as &#8220;the Straussian moment,&#8221; that is, a moment best approached by way of the ideas of Leo Strauss. This was, of course, the post-9/11 moment, and according to Thiel, that event had &#8220;called into question . . . the entire political and military framework of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and indeed of the modern age.&#8221; The essay offers a thorough critique of liberal internationalism as a naïve and obsolete security framework. 9/11, for Thiel, shattered the longstanding assumption that integration into the global market would bring peace and cooperation between nations. The latter belief was based on a simplistic model of the homo economicus , which artificially bracketed the violent passions and fanatical commitments that truly drove human behavior. For Thiel, 9/11 was a philosophical challenge to rethink assumptions about human nature. From Strauss, Thiel draws the idea that &#8220;even in the most liberal or open-minded regimes there exist certain deeply problematic truths.&#8221; Among these are dark truths about violence and the state. Thiel quotes Strauss&#8217;s statement that &#8220;there cannot be a great and glorious society without the equivalent of the murder of Remus by his brother Romulus.&#8221; He concludes from Strauss that the liberal myth of the enlightened self-interest of the homo economicus as the basis of universal harmony was always just that: a myth. There was always a dark, violent side to the American and global liberal project, which wiser observers (including Strauss) grasped, but avoided discussing too overtly. One of the essay&#8217;s most revealing passages concerns the very business Thiel was entering into at the time he wrote it. In his discussion of the disavowed darker side of the American liberal state, he quotes Strauss&#8217;s statement that &#8220;the most just society cannot survive without intelligence, espionage.&#8221; Thiel concludes from Strauss&#8217;s statement that &#8220;[i]nstead of the United Nations, filled with interminable and inconclusive parliamentary debates . . . we should consider Echelon, the secret coordination of the world&#8217;s intelligence services, as the decisive path to a truly global pax Americana .&#8221; Palantir might be understood, based on this section of Thiel&#8217;s essay, as applied Straussianism: an enterprise that acknowledges the deep, dangerous undercurrent of human violence and harnesses the reams of data generated by the internet to monitor and control it. The other key figure for Palantir is Alex Karp. Like Thiel, Karp does not come from a primarily technological background: both did law degrees, and Karp took his humanities training further than Thiel, earning a Ph.D. in social theory at Goethe University in Frankfurt. It&#8217;s been widely claimed that his advisor was the famous theorist Jürgen Habermas, but a quick glance at his dissertation (available online ) reveals this is not the case. Karp&#8217;s work does engage with the Frankfurt school of critical theory with which Habermas&#8217;s work is identified, in the form of the latter&#8217;s teacher Theodor W. Adorno. Moira Weigel&#8217;s recent article &#8220; Palantir Goes to the Frankfurt School &#8221; offers a thorough reading of Karp&#8217;s dissertation, Aggression in the Life-World . It is a complex and technical account of what is obviously a theoretically dense text, but Weigel offers valuable insight into how Karp&#8217;s philosophical insights converge with what I&#8217;m describing as Thiel&#8217;s &#8220;Straussian&#8221; agenda for Palantir. Like Thiel, Karp turns out to be primarily interested in the repressed violence that threatens human social life, although his theoretical account of it is distinct. Karp&#8217;s dissertation, as Weigel summarizes it, borrows and elaborates Adorno&#8217;s critique of what he calls &#8220;jargon.&#8221; Adorno&#8217;s target is the language of existential philosophy, especially that of Martin Heidegger. For him, Heidegger uses the obscure terminology for which he is famous &#8211; words like &#8220;Dasein&#8221; &#8211; to mystify historical and political predicaments as universal conditions. As Weigel glosses Adorno&#8217;s critique, &#8220;Heidegger turns the real precarity of people who might at any time lose their jobs and homes into a defining condition of&nbsp; Dasein . . . To this extent, jargon has an a- or even anti-political character: it disguises current and contingent effects of social domination into eternal and unchangeable characteristics of human existence.&#8221; According to Weigel, Karp&#8217;s interest (unlike Adorno&#8217;s) is on &#8220;the question of what psychological needs jargon fulfills.&#8221; His answer to this question relies on a Freudian assumption of the primacy of aggression as a manifestation of the death drive. A basic problem of social existence, from this point of view, is the need to regulate and/or sublimate such anti-social impulses for the sake of social stability. &#8220;Jargon&#8221; of the sort that Adorno critiques, Karp argues, serves as a way to &#8220;admit aggression into social life and give it a central role in consolidating identity.&#8221; The idea appears to be that &#8220;jargon,&#8221; which excludes those who do not grasp it while constituting a community of those who do, acts out a hostility towards the social order as it exists while constituting an imaginary community of &#8220;those who speak, and hear&#8221; it. In this way, &#8220;[w]ishes that contradict social norms are brought into the web of social relations . . . in such a way that they do not need to be sanctioned or punished for violating social norms.&#8221; There is much more to say about Weigel&#8217;s account of Karp&#8217;s dissertation, but this brief synopsis suffices to draw certain parallels with &#8220;The Straussian Moment.&#8221; Like Karp, Thiel is concerned with the violent, irrational dimension of human life and the threat it poses to the social order. For Thiel, the 9/11 attacks are the key illustration of this danger, and of the West&#8217;s ideological naïveté with regard to it. From Strauss, Thiel draws the claim that this darker dimension of social existence must be addressed in an indirect manner, both through a philosophical discourse that acknowledges it subtly rather than overtly, and through modes of politics that operate largely outside of the public sphere, such as espionage. That is because explicitly acknowledging the deeper reality of this violence would foster cynicism and disillusionment that would ultimately corrode the very order that must be upheld. Karp&#8217;s interest in &#8220;jargon&#8221; similarly proceeds from the same concern with the disavowed reverse side of the social order and the ways that violent impulses hostile to it can be contained or integrated through indirect expression. According to Weigel, Karp&#8217;s repurposing of Adorno&#8217;s account of jargon represents a step backward from the latter philosopher&#8217;s work. Whereas Adorno &#8220;locat[ed] jargon in specific experiences of modernity,&#8221; she writes, Karp &#8220;transforms it into an expression of drives that, because they are timeless, are merely psychological.&#8221; She claims that Palantir proceeds from the same ahistorical premise, since &#8220;[i]n data analysis, the role of the analyst is not to demystify and dispel reification. On the contrary, it is precisely to fix identity from its digital traces and to make predictions on the basis of the same.&#8221; Like jargon in Adorno&#8217;s account, data analytics &#8220;covers for domination insofar as it makes the human condition—or rather, human conditions as they are at the time of speaking—appear unchangeable.&#8221; From Weigel&#8217;s perspective, Adorno&#8217;s account of jargon (and related Marxist and historicist analytical frameworks) offers a method of accounting for the ways that &#8220;[a]lgorithms take the histories of oppression embedded in training data and project them into the future.&#8221; In &#8220;The Straussian Moment,&#8221; Thiel offers a sort of preemptive rejoinder to Weigel&#8217;s critique of Karp. He clearly regards the Marxian assumption that economic deprivation and domination are the primary drivers of political conflict as the left-wing version of the homo economicus myth that 9/11 has left in ruins. As he writes: &#8220;the singular example of bin Laden and his followers has rendered incomplete the economically motivated political thought that has dominated the modern West . . . [f]rom The Wealth of Nations on the right to Das Kapital on the left.&#8221; His proximate evidence is the basic fact that the most dramatic attacks against the capitalist West were masterminded by &#8220;upper-middle-class Saudi Arabians, often with college degrees and great expectations,&#8221; motivated by religious piety, not outrage against the economic inequality of which their leader was a beneficiary. The West was caught off-guard, he claims, because it assumed that violence against it would come from the economically dispossessed: &#8220;from favelas in Rio de Janeiro, or from starving peasants in Burkina Faso.&#8221; This mode of analysis had failed to identify the real sources of social instability. One can imagine, then, that Thiel might have seen great value in Karp&#8217;s alternative method: to parse language for traces of unconscious aggression in order to (in Weigel&#8217;s phrase) &#8220;reveal otherwise hidden identities and affinities—and the drive to commit violence that lies latent in them.&#8221; Thiel makes a positive case for modes of analysis focused not on economic relations but on the deep, often destructive moral passions that, he claims, truly motivate human beings. Karp, as Weigel puts it, similarly &#8220;makes aggressive violence the substance of the social.&#8221; Although Karp derives his view from Freud and other modern thinkers, it looks like another variant of what Thiel calls the &#8220;older Western tradition . . . that offered a less dogmatically economic view of human nature.&#8221; Peculiarly, then, Palantir&#8217;s sophisticated technological enterprise seems to follow directly from an explicit reversion to the pre-Enlightenment models of human nature.

Find this story in your account&#x2019;s &#x2018;Saved for Later&#x2019; section. Comment Photo: Busà Photography/Getty Images Photo: Busà Photography/Getty Images Back in 2003, John Poindexter got a call from Richard Perle, an old friend from their days serving together in the Reagan administration. Perle, one of the architects of the Iraq War, which started that year, wanted to introduce Poindexter to a couple of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who were starting a software company. The firm, Palantir Technologies, was hoping to pull together data collected by a wide range of spy agencies — everything from human intelligence and cell-phone calls to travel records and financial transactions — to help identify and stop terrorists planning attacks on the United States. Poindexter, a retired rear admiral who had been forced to resign as Reagan’s national-security adviser over his role in the Iran-Contra scandal, wasn’t exactly the kind of starry-eyed idealist who usually appeals to Silicon Valley visionaries. Returning to the Pentagon after the 9/11 attacks, he had begun researching ways to develop a data-mining program that was as spooky as its name: Total Information Awareness. His work — dubbed a “super-snoop’s dream” by conservative columnist William Safire — was a precursor to the National Security Agency’s sweeping surveillance programs that were exposed a decade later by Edward Snowden. Yet Poindexter was precisely the person Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, the co-founders of Palantir, wanted to meet. Their new company was similar in ambition to what Poindexter had tried to create at the Pentagon, and they wanted to pick the brain of the man now widely viewed as the godfather of modern surveillance. “When I talked to Peter Thiel early on, I was impressed with the design and the ideas they had for the user interface,” Poindexter told me recently. “But I could see they didn’t have — well, as you call it, the back end, to automatically sort through the data and eliminate that tedious task for the users. And my feedback from the people who used it at the time, they were not happy with it at all. It was just much too manual.” Smoking his pipe, just as he had when he testified to Congress 33 years ago about his role in facilitating covert arms sales to Iran, Poindexter told me he had suggested to Karp and Thiel that they partner with one of the companies that worked on Total Information Awareness. But the two men weren’t interested. “They were a bunch of young, arrogant guys,” Poindexter said, “and they were convinced they could do it all.” Seventeen years later, Palantir is seeking to cash in on its ability to “do it all.” Over the years, the company has worked with some of the government’s most secretive agencies, including the CIA, the NSA, and the Pentagon’s Special Operations Command. As recently as two years ago, its value was estimated at $20 billion, elevating it to the loftiest heights of the tech “unicorns,” privately held companies valued at more than $1 billion. On September 30, Palantir is scheduled to go public, selling shares in a highly anticipated gambit that could make Karp one of Silicon Valley’s richest CEOs and cement the reputation of Thiel, the first outside investor in Facebook and a co-founder of PayPal, as one of the most visionary tech entrepreneurs of his generation. Palantir’s public offering is founded on the company’s sales pitch that its software represents the ultimate tool of surveillance. Named after the “Seeing Stones” in The Lord of the Rings, Palantir is designed to ingest the mountains of data collected by soldiers and spies and police — fingerprints, signals intelligence, bank records, tips from confidential informants — and enable users to spot hidden relationships, uncover criminal and terrorist networks, and even anticipate future attacks. Thiel and Karp have effectively positioned Palantir as a pro-military arm of Silicon Valley, a culture dominated by tech gurus who view their work as paving the way for a global utopia. (Palantir declined to comment for this story, citing the mandatory “quiet period” prior to a public listing.) It’s a strange moment, given the widespread alarm over the ever-expanding reach of technology, for a tech company to be marketing itself as the most powerful weapon in the national-security state’s arsenal — wrapping itself in what one Silicon Valley veteran calls “the mystique of being used to kill people.” But as Palantir seeks to sell its stock on Wall Street, even some of its initial admirers are warning that the company’s software may not live up to its hype. More than a dozen former military and intelligence officials I interviewed — some of whom were instrumental in persuading government agencies to work with Palantir — expressed concerns about the firm’s penchant for exaggeration, its apparent flouting of federal rules designed to ensure fair competition, and its true worth. The company has largely succeeded, they say, not because of its technological wizardry but because its interface is slicker and more user friendly than the alternatives created by defense contractors. “Where you get into trouble is when the software gets so complicated that you have to send people in to manage it,” said one former CIA official who is complimentary of Palantir. “The moment you introduce an expensive IT engineer into the process, you’ve cut your profits.” Palantir, it turns out, has run headlong into the problem plaguing many tech firms engaged in the quest for total information awareness: Real-world data is often too messy and complex for computers to translate without lots of help from humans. A “heat map” Palantir developed of attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The software’s user-friendly interface, military insiders say, is a big part of its success. Photo: DEFENSEUPDATE/YOUTUBE One of the central claims made about Palantir — its creation myth, in essence — is that its software was somehow instrumental in locating Osama bin Laden. The company, which has posted a news story repeating the rumor on its website, likes to shroud its supposed involvement in an air of mystery. “That’s one of those stories we’re not allowed to comment about,” Karp once said in an interview. The only known basis for the claim, which has been repeated in dozens of articles, comes from The Finish , Mark Bowden’s book on the 2011 raid that killed bin Laden. Bowden does not actually say Palantir was used in the raid, but he credits the company with perfecting the data collection and analysis that Poindexter had initiated with Total Information Awareness in the aftermath of 9/11. Palantir, Bowden writes, “came up with a program that elegantly accomplished what TIA had set out to do.” No one I spoke with in either national security or intelligence believes Palantir played any significant role in finding bin Laden. Thiel, according to Poindexter, wasn’t even interested in building on TIA’s work. “His people were telling him they didn’t need it,” Poindexter recalled. From the start, Palantir has drawn on a circle of loyal insiders to build the company. In the late 1980s, as an undergraduate at Stanford, Thiel founded a conservative student publication called The Stanford Review to wage war on what he saw as the university’s liberal agenda, including “mandatory race and ethnic studies” and “ ‘domestic partner’ status for homosexuals.” (Thiel, who is gay, married his longtime partner in 2017.) The Review served as a breeding ground for Palantir: Over the years, according to an analysis by a Stanford graduate named Andrew Granato, 24 of the company’s employees came from the staff of Thiel’s student publication. Palantir’s initial technology was likewise adopted from one of Thiel’s other endeavors: PayPal. In 2000, engineers at the online-payment company wanted to use software to help identify fraudulent transactions, but they found that computer algorithms alone couldn’t keep up with how quickly criminals adapted. Their solution was a program called Igor, after a Russian criminal who was taunting PayPal’s fraud department, that flagged suspicious transactions for humans to review. In 2003, after PayPal was sold, Thiel approached Alex Karp, a former Stanford classmate with a Ph.D. in neoclassical social theory, with a novel idea: Why not apply Igor to track terrorist networks through their financial transactions? At the time, the CIA unit responsible for locating bin Laden had little experience, or even interest, in such an approach. Thiel put in the seed money, and after a few years of pitching investors, Palantir got its first major breakthrough in the national-security world with an estimated $2 million investment from In-Q-Tel, a venture-capital firm set up by the CIA. According to a former intelligence official who was directly involved with that investment, the agency hoped that tapping the tech expertise of Silicon Valley would enable it to integrate widely disparate sources of data regardless of format. “I have mixed feelings about the CIA,” Richard Perle told me, “but their angel investment in Palantir may have been their most inspired move.” In-Q-Tel’s investment provided Palantir with something even more important than cash: the imprimatur of the CIA. As doors started to open in Washington, Palantir began to attract fans in the secretive communities of intelligence and national security. One former senior intelligence official recalled visiting the company in Menlo Park, California, around 2005. Palantir didn’t even have its own space — it was working out of the offices of a venture capitalist involved in the firm. “We go out back to the carriage house, and there were sleeping bags under the desks,” the former official recalled. “That’s where the engineers who were doing the code were actually living and sleeping.” But contracts with spy agencies were never going to provide Palantir with enough scale to satisfy investors. The company needed new customers, especially in the lucrative world of defense contracting, and Thiel knew just how to get them. In Zero to One, his 2014 book on entrepreneurship, Thiel notes a critical move in PayPal’s success: In the early days, the company essentially paid people to sign up, handing out $10 to each new customer. Under federal rules for procurement, which are laid out in a telephone-book-size manual, you can’t pay Pentagon officials to buy your product because that would constitute bribery. And it makes no sense to entice individual soldiers to use your product, because they don’t have the power to make procurement decisions. But that, remarkably, is exactly what Palantir did. Not long after In-Q-Tel’s investment, the company began providing software and training to members of the armed forces about to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather than focusing on lobbying the Pentagon from the outside, Palantir introduced its product from inside the military, creating both an internal demand and a network of pretrained users. “They would basically contact the soldiers and say, ‘Hey, I would like to give you some training on this tool you will get in theater. Would you like to get trained on it?’ ” recalled Heidi Shyu, then the Army’s chief weapons buyer. Chris Ieva, a Marine infantry officer who was attending the Naval Postgraduate School in 2006, was an early beneficiary of Palantir’s unorthodox marketing technique. The school is located in Monterey, California, just down the road from Silicon Valley, and Palantir had already established a foothold at the institution. Ieva was excited when he was invited to visit the tech start-up, where he saw engineers walking around with T-shirts that read GOOGLE IS OUR BACKUP JOB. But Palantir wasn’t trying to recruit Ieva as an employee. Instead, he said, he got funding worth about $10,000 to support his graduate work, which paid for a high-end computer and access to critical data. Ieva was also supplied with Palantir’s software, which the school was leasing for $19,000 a year; the company provided an analyst at its own expense to work with students. “In return,” Ieva told me, “I had to publish a thesis, and the findings would sort of go back to them.” By the time he deployed to Afghanistan in 2011, Ieva was a true believer in Palantir. He was not only trained to use the company’s software but given a personal version to take with him. It didn’t take long for word of Palantir to make its way up the chain of command. Intrigued by the software his troops were using, Major General John Toolan, the commander of coalition forces in southwestern Afghanistan, met with Palantir. At the time, the primary software for integrating data on the battlefield was the Distributed Common Ground System–Army, which was being produced by leading defense contractors at a cost expected to exceed $10 billion. But users of DCGS–A, particularly those with no training in intelligence systems, found it to be clunky and prone to crashing. Palantir’s marketing campaign not only had worked, but the Pentagon was essentially picking up the tab for it. In Afghanistan, improvised explosive devices were the leading killer of troops, and Palantir allowed users to quickly track where the attacks were taking place. Toolan, impressed with the technology, secured some modest funding to buy the software, which came with the added benefit of a team of company engineers who embedded with his forces in Afghanistan. Palantir’s “forward-deployed engineers,” as they are called, essentially operated as a mobile sales force, customizing the software to the needs of each client. “They sent young Palantir technicians and engineers and software designers with us so that when we had a problem, we worked on it together,” Toolan, who later served as an adviser to Palantir, told me. “And that was a heck of a lot better support than what was coming out of the Army for DCGS–A, which was nothing.” Palantir quickly made inroads in Afghanistan with both the Marine Corps and the Army. But back at the Pentagon, its bottom-up salesmanship was attracting high-level scrutiny. Shyu, the Army’s chief weapons buyer, warned that it was illegal for soldiers to accept free training and software from Palantir. She resolved the issue by putting the company on a modest contract to pay for what it had been providing for free. Palantir’s marketing campaign had not only worked, but the Pentagon was essentially picking up the tab for it. But Palantir didn’t want one-off contracts — it wanted to become the Pentagon’s primary provider of intelligence software on the battlefield. That drew the ire of military officials who were invested in DCGS–A. What was this off-the-shelf software with a slick user interface that was challenging the system they had spent years assembling? At that stage, as critics were pointing out, Palantir couldn’t do the type of data integration across the armed services that the Pentagon needed. Shyu decided to check things out for herself. In 2013, she visited military bases in Afghanistan, including those at Bagram, Kandahar, and Kabul, and spoke with intelligence analysts and soldiers engaged in military operations on the battlefield. At one point, she even watched analysts using DCGS–A and Palantir side by side. Both software programs operated as a sort of Google for spies, allowing users to search and sift through intelligence and battlefield data. But the user interface for Palantir was more like the everyday programs soldiers were accustomed to running on their PCs or Macs. After loading Palantir on their laptops, soldiers could quickly scroll and click through to different options, whether they were searching for a Taliban leader’s associates or tracking the financial network of a drug kingpin. Palantir also incorporated appealing visual icons to represent things like brigades and battalions, in contrast to the stodgy military interface of DCGS–A, which relied on less intuitive features. With Palantir, an analyst could pull up a map of an area soldiers were about to patrol, draw a bubble around it, and see where improvised explosive devices had gone off in past weeks or months. With just a few clicks, Palantir created a heat map of potential danger zones. Analysts could do the same thing with DCGS–A, but it took longer. Another plus for Palantir: It didn’t crash nearly as often. Its software wasn’t necessarily any better at parsing intelligence, but Shyu could see why some soldiers, particularly infantry who didn’t have time to learn a complex program, preferred it. “I walked away convinced that Palantir is much easier to use,” she says. As Palantir established itself with the Pentagon’s leadership, it began to operate more like the top-tier defense contractors it was hoping to replace, hiring lobbyists and spreading money around Washington. It launched an all-out war over the future of DCGS–A with two big guns on its side: Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the soon-to-be head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and Representative Duncan Hunter, a Marine reservist from California who had been elected to Congress in 2008. At a congressional budget hearing, Hunter berated the Army’s senior leadership for not providing Palantir to the troops, leading to a near shouting match with a prominent general. No one quite understood Hunter’s obsession with Palantir. “I won’t question his passion,” a former senior Army official told me. “But sometimes his passion overtook his veracity.” Flynn also advocated for Palantir and called for the military to replace DCGS–A. “The Army needs to move to a DCGS 2.0 quickly,” he told the Washington Times in 2016. “Frankly, I would even change the name, because it just has such a bad moniker right now.” That same year, Palantir went nuclear: It sued the Army, accusing it of improperly excluding the company from the competition for the next stage of DCGS–A. In court, Palantir’s lawyers, from the high-powered firm Boies Schiller Flexner, accused two Army intelligence officials of having a vendetta against the company that resulted in “six years of bias and prejudice and irrational behavior from the Army.” Hunter also worked to scuttle the nomination of one of the officials, Lieutenant General Mary Legere, who had been slated to become the first woman to head the Defense Intelligence Agency. The lesson of Palantir,” said one former official, “is that sometimes being a jerk pays off. Several former military officials told me there was no personal bias against Palantir. The issue, they said, was the way the company had ignored the rules by giving away free goods and services in the form of Palantir software and training. “They did that in amounts of over a million dollars, I know for sure,” said a former senior Army official who was involved with the issue. “And that was just one customer at an Army-brigade level.” (The company’s allies insisted that Palantir did not violate Pentagon rules.) What’s more, the former official added, the company refused an offer from the Army to incorporate its user interface into the existing system, citing its proprietary technology. “They wanted DCGS–A to be all Palantir,” the official said. In November 2016, the court rejected Palantir’s “bad faith” allegations but ruled the Army had erred in not allowing the company to compete for the DCGS–A contract. Several former national-security officials I spoke with — including some who support Palantir’s technology — expressed bewilderment over the company’s bridge-burning approach. Suing your customer is not the way the Raytheons or Lockheed Martins tend to do business, but it’s not unprecedented for Silicon Valley. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, sued the Air Force in his quest to break into the market for military rockets. “The lesson of Palantir,” said one former official, “is that sometimes being a jerk pays off.” Just days after winning its lawsuit against the Army, Palantir had another stroke of good luck. Donald Trump, who had received more than $1 million in campaign and super-PAC contributions from Thiel, won the presidential election. Thiel served on Trump’s transition team, and Palantir suddenly found itself with direct access to top administration officials. According to emails that Andrew Granato, the Stanford graduate, received under the Freedom of Information Act, Thiel met in January 2017 with Francis Collins, who was on his way to Trump Tower to ask the president-elect to reappoint him as head of the National Institutes of Health. “I am looking forward to learning more about Palantir’s current areas of interest,” Collins informed Thiel after the meeting. At the same time, he nudged Thiel about his reappointment. “Of course I’m also curious about what the next steps will be after the interview in Trump Tower,” he wrote. “Is there any way to predict the timing of a decision?” In June 2017, Trump announced that he was reappointing Collins as head of NIH. And in September 2018, NIH awarded Palantir a three-year contract worth $7 million. More taxpayer money quickly followed. In 2019, Palantir won a ten-year contract for DCGS–A worth as much as $876 million. That same year, the company renewed a multiyear contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where Palantir’s software has been used by the same division that targets the families of immigrants for deportation. In April, without soliciting any bids from competitors, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded Palantir nearly $25 million to track national COVID-19 data. And in May, the Department of Veterans Affairs spent $5 million on Palantir’s software to “track and analyze COVID-19 outbreak areas” and to provide timely data on supply-chain capacity, hospital inventory, and lab diagnostics. The company has lost two of its biggest supporters in Washington. In January, Duncan Hunter resigned from Congress after pleading guilty to corruption. And Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign as Trump’s national-security adviser, is currently fighting to have his case dismissed after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. But one of Thiel’s closest associates has occupied high-level posts in two of the places that matter most to Palantir. In 2019, Michael Kratsios, Thiel’s former chief of staff, was appointed chief technology officer for the White House, where he served as one of Trump’s top technology advisers. In July, Kratsios — a 33-year-old with an undergraduate degree in political science — became acting chief technologist at the Pentagon, where he replaced Mike Griffin, a former NASA administrator with a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering. Like all smart defense contractors, Palantir has ensured its future in Washington by spreading money around to Democrats as well as Republicans. But despite all its federal contracts and bipartisan connections, Palantir is far from healthy. After nearly two decades of aggressive marketing, the company is still losing money and burning cash. In 2019, although its revenues grew by 25 percent, Palantir lost nearly $600 million for the second year in a row. In that light, analysts say, its decision to go public amid a historic economic downturn could be driven by investors and longtime employees eager to be paid out. “Insiders may be struggling to sell their equity and options in Palantir in secondary markets,” observes Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, which advises institutional investors. “A public listing would potentially end the frustration [that] has apparently been an issue for Palantir management for at least a few years.” Palantir has struggled to expand its commercial business, a key pillar of its promise to investors. By Karp’s own account, the company considered Palantir Metropolis, a product designed for financial institutions, to be an “unmitigated failure” and scrapped it when it failed to find a market. A much-vaunted joint venture with Credit Suisse to police the bank’s own employees was also deemed a “complete bust.” In addition, Palantir appears to be out of favor in some intelligence and national-security circles. By 2015, according to BuzzFeed News, the company’s relationship with the NSA had ended, and Karp was telling employees that the CIA was “recalcitrant” and didn’t “like us.” (Both agencies declined to comment.) Palantir has also had surprisingly limited success in marketing itself to police, a seemingly natural customer for software that can track criminal networks. The company worked pro bono for the New Orleans Police Department for six years on a secretive contract to target alleged criminals, but the project appears to have ended in 2018. The New York Police Department also ended its contract with Palantir several years ago. Zachary Tumin, who served as the NYPD’s deputy commissioner for strategic initiatives until 2017, was a fan of the technology. He dispatched a member of his analytics staff to help Bronx detectives use Palantir to create a map of gang members and their activities, marrying data from social media and a wide variety of government sources. “Being able to bring all that data together into one place helped us get a very precise idea of who was involved around a particular set of events,” Tumin said. On April 27, 2016, apparently aided by Palantir, the NYPD and ICE conducted the biggest gang raid in New York history. Hundreds of officers and federal agents swooped down on the Bronx, bursting into homes and waking families at gunpoint. According to emails obtained by the Appeal under FOIA, a Palantir employee assisted ICE’s Violent Gang Unit. “FYI we’re all set here,” the employee wrote ahead of the raid. “Helping some random agents get set up but we should have a good viz on everyone.” Prosecutors indicted 120 people for gang activity, though residents protested that many of those swept up in the raid had no gang connections. Palantir, Tumin recalled, was a “highly effective” tool, but its help didn’t come cheap. Every time the NYPD asked the company to add more data, the price went up. “The more powerful and interesting it became, the higher the tax on you for using it,” Tumin said. In addition, the software required a lot of customizing to fit the NYPD’s needs. “We couldn’t make it work without those modifications,” Tumin recalled. “It was too kludgy — it was built for a generic something or other.” The need for customization points to a deeper problem for Palantir. The customization is what clients like, but it’s also what could prevent the company from scaling. All those software engineers sleeping under their desks may have been great in 2005, when the company was flush with venture capital, but employing an army of humans to endlessly tweak the software doesn’t exactly presage huge profits. “I used to have a metric when I was in the government,” said the former senior intelligence official who visited Palantir’s engineers back in their sleeping-bag days. “People would come in and say, ‘We’ve got this fantastic automated translation system,’ or automated anything. I would say, ‘Does this use RFOP?’ And they would say, ‘I don’t know what that is.’ ” The acronym stood for Rooms Full of People, meaning the army of analysts required to clean up the data and crunch the numbers. How good any given data-mining system is depends in large part on what’s lurking behind the curtain. Is it artificial intelligence parsing large data sets of complex financial transactions to find the next terrorist? Or is it a room full of eager software engineers sleeping on the floor? Palantir portrays its software as like its namesake — a crystal ball you gaze into for answers. The company emphasizes that it has reduced the time needed to get its software up and running, and former officials told me Palantir has made big improvements to its back end over the years. But the truth is that it still appears to take a lot of manual labor to make it work, and there’s nothing magical about that. That distinction did not matter to the soldiers in Afghanistan who were trying to pinpoint IEDs, but it makes a huge difference to potential investors, because Rooms Full of People are not nearly as profitable as simply installing software and walking away. “Here’s the dirty secret of all of these data-analytics solutions,” a former Pentagon research manager told me. “They all claim to take these disparate data sources and put them together and then discover these amazing correlations between variables. But the problem is that all of these data sets are terrible. They’re dirty.” Many types of information, after all, are gathered and processed by humans. It may be entered inconsistently or provided in wildly different formats or riddled with inaccuracies. It’s messy, like the real world it reflects and records, and it doesn’t always fit into software with any sort of mathematical precision. When I saw a recent demonstration of Palantir software, it became clear that this dirty secret isn’t very secret. The interface struck me as user friendly, something anyone with basic computer literacy could figure out. Want to know how many aircraft are available for a specific mission and how long it will take them to get to their destination? With a simple query, Palantir can tell you. Then I was shown a data set on military personnel, which had to be “cleaned up” to make it usable on Palantir. It wasn’t only a magic code doing the cleanup; it was human beings — and even locating someone who could explain what needed to be done had proven time consuming. “It took many calls to find a subject-matter expert,” one person involved told me. It sounded a lot like Rooms Full of People. On September 9, Alex Karp appeared on an investor webcast dressed in bright sports gear and hiking up a trail on roller skis. Often described as “eccentric” or a “deviant philosopher,” he stopped and faced the camera, his unruly curls pointing in different directions, and began to talk about Palantir’s tremendous growth. Some 17 years after Karp and Thiel met with John Poindexter, full of confidence and short on engineering, the company was finally set to go public. Karp blames the darlings of Silicon Valley, not Palantir, for violating people’s privacy. It’s companies like Facebook and Google, he argues, that are selling their users’ data, while Palantir targets terrorists and criminals. “The engineering elite of Silicon Valley may know more than most about building software,” he observed in the company’s filing to go public. “But they do not know more about how society should be organized or what justice requires.” (His argument ignores the fact that Palantir has been used to analyze data from social media, including Facebook posts.) Poindexter wrote to me shortly after we spoke about his meeting with Karp and Thiel back in 2003. He had seen a recent article about Palantir, he said, and he was shocked at Karp’s transformation. “Karp was clean shaven and had a conservative, traditional-length haircut,” Poindexter told me. “I have no idea why he changed his image. I would not have recognized him from current photos.” With Karp, as with Palantir, it’s often hard to know what is real and what is mythmaking. It’s often repeated in articles, for example, that Karp studied in Germany under Jürgen Habermas, perhaps the most influential living philosopher. “The most important thing I learned from him is I couldn’t be him, and I didn’t want to be him,” Karp confided on a recent podcast with a sort of knowing intimacy. In fact, as Moira Weigel, a historian of media technologies, has pointed out, Karp not only didn’t do his dissertation under Habermas, he didn’t even study in the same department. That sort of exaggeration could be chalked up to Silicon Valley bravado. Yet it bears an eerie similarity to the bin Laden story, a rumor Palantir has allowed, or even encouraged, to be repeated as fact. As the company goes public, however, it will be required to open its books, and the facts will become inescapable. As recently as 2018, Palantir was being cited as having a valuation of $20 billion, ranking it among Silicon Valley’s top-five unicorns, alongside Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX, and WeWork. Since then, WeWork has imploded, Uber is trading below its public-offering price, and Airbnb has been hit by a pandemic-driven collapse in bookings. While Palantir’s filings indicate it hopes to surpass $20 billion, some industry analysts suspect that goal is far beyond what its business model can justify. How much Palantir is worth depends in large part on what kind of company you think it is. Palantir markets itself as “software as a service” — a business category that includes products like Microsoft Office 365. But Microsoft is not embedding software engineers in Afghanistan to help soldiers with Excel. If, on the other hand, Palantir is more like a traditional government IT contractor, which provides people as a service, it would be valued at about one times revenue — a number that would place its current worth at less than $1 billion. “You have to make sure that you can get to a dramatically different model at Palantir … to get a valuation up to the kinds of numbers that we’re hearing out there,” Douglas Harned, a Bernstein analyst, explained in a recent webinar. So why are people still so excited about Palantir? One former national-security official told me the company is now famous for being famous, sort of like the Kardashians. But he’s doubtful Palantir’s technology can match the sky-high valuations that came with all the hype. “As soon as there’s an IPO, I will short the stock,” he said. “If I’m right — if, in fact, Palantir is loved in the way the Kardashians are loved — well, the Kardashians are not going to be famous forever. So short the stock while they’re famous — and just wait for their 15 minutes of fame to end.” *This article appears in the September 28, 2020, issue of New York Magazine. Subscribe Now!

Chainalysis, a firm that investigates Bitcoin transactions, found that the majority of the 22 transactions on Dec. 8 went to Nick Fuentes, a far-right internet influencer who was in the crowd in Washington but has denied being part of the deadly mob that stormed the Capitol. The 35-year-old Frenchman who transferred the money posted a suicide note on his blog the next day, saying he was chronically ill and wanted to leave his wealth to “certain causes and people.” Chainalysis did not release the man’s identity. By retracing the researchers’ steps, an Associated Press journalist found his blog and suicide note. A funeral home published his obituary, including burial information, but later deleted it; a cached version can still be found on the internet. Federal investigators in the United States are looking into possible “coordination or planning” ahead of the riot and are using a number of methods they deploy routinely in criminal investigations, including examining financial transactions and cellphone and travel records. Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington, said investigators were also examining whether there was any “command and control,” and he vowed to bring charges if prosecutors can prove a conspiracy. No conspiracy charges have been brought so far. French financial investigators declined to comment. The Chainalysis investigation found that the Frenchman sent 28.15 Bitcoins, worth about $522,000 to 22 addresses, including many belonging to American far-right activists and organizations. Fuentes received about $250,000 worth. Other recipients included an anti-immigration organization, an alt-right streamer and a number of unidentified addresses. “The donation, as well as reports of the planning that went into the Capitol raid on alt-right communication channels, also suggests that domestic extremist groups may be better organized and funded than previously thought,” the researchers wrote. ___ Colleen Long contributed from Washington.

I think this history repeats itself, and some kind of new and interesting phenomenon is happening .” — Kim Namjoon, member of the group BTS. Modernity as an historical category or condition still prompts exhausting conflicts and discussions within philosophy. If the nature of its temporality or its “postmodern” phase is debated, at least as a state of critique of the world project that has prevailed since the 18th century, modernity remains at the heart of the question, the domain where the supposed Aufklärung [1] would execute its universalist project. Criticism comes from the most varied sides of macropolitics, or perhaps we could say cosmopolitics.[2] One ongoing convergent encounter is that between the so-called traditionalists[3] – fully denying the progressive, civilizational or “enlightening” character of the time of Enlightenment and technics – with the perspectivists[4], who hold a critical position where they situate modernity as the time of iron and of fire, domination, epistemicide, colonization and the metaphysical and material organization of a single project, kind of subject, epistemology and worldview. The encounters and disagreements between different macropolitical or cosmopolitical agendas mark a constant throughout modernity. It&#8217;s not just the reproval of the traditionalists and Gaians that tunes the constant criticism of modernity, but in another register, this “approximation” between different worldviews can also present itself as aligned on a similar axis. Silvia Federici, for one, in Caliban and the Witch presents a critique of both modernity and capitalism and considers these two processes as reactionary, not composed by an understanding of “progress”. Federici has certain intentions with this project, one being to relate the genesis and history of capitalism through a feminist, bodily and Marxist perspective. The book’s title being inspired by The Tempest by Shakespeare, she focuses on Caliban as the Caribbean and anti-colonial rebel, and the witch embodies a synthesis of the women who were protagonists of persecution and massacres at the end of the Middle Ages. Federici presents the elementality of gender through an understanding not only of the destructive and exploitative years of capitalism’s genesis, but also of the ongoing logic of domestic work and the role of women.[5] Primitive accumulation, as presented by Marx, appears as this very process of restructuring the means of social and economic production, generating a violent process of familial and corporate expropriation, and separating direct production and the means of production while privatizing previously collectivized lands. It is through a genealogy of modern mechanistic philosophy that Federici traces an interesting perspective on the birth of capitalism and its relation to the project of modernity. Chapter Three “The Great Caliban” quotes and utilizes Michel Foucault’s “discipline of the body” which he excavates between the State and the Church. Federici draws unquestionable webs of relation between this process of mechanization of the body and the philosophies of René Descartes and Thomas Hobbes, representative authors of the birth of modern philosophy. Federici&#8217;s work, in general terms, establishes that capitalism and modernity are inseparable: Capitalism was the counter-revolution that destroyed the possibilities that had emerged in the anti-feudal struggle [&#8230;] We must emphasize this aspect, for the belief that capitalism “evolved” from feudalism and that it represents a higher form of life society has not yet come undone (Federici, 2016, p. 44). Yet while for Federici capitalism and modernity form a reactionary double-bind attacking communes and collective ways of life, other macropolitical visions would beg to differ. Capitalism emerges as the great way out, perhaps the only one, for what became known as accelerationism[6], more specifically to one of the protagonists of this article: Nick Land. Land&#8217;s thought goes back to the same critical juncture, not positioning capitalism as the origin of the problem, but rather like a boom in the field, the thermonuclear device responsible for the possible outbreak of modernity. Capital itself emerges as a new force (Land is heavily in dialogue here with Anti-Oedipus by Deleuze &amp; Guattari) and is the cultural-symbolic organization of the inherent acceleration of capitalism, projecting futures of unconscious revolutionary forces that for many years were locked by pre-modern culture. Land perceives capital as a contending flux of schizophrenic production; with capitalism, the disinhibition of modern syntheses (at least on the level of collective human experience) are realized by capital itself as this impersonal zone of transcendent subjectivity: the void of capital is the possible portal for shattering the transcendental screen that conditions the senses of human experience (and respectively the socius) in a space-time prison. In &#8220;Kant, Capital and the Prohibition of Incest&#8221; Land points to a configuration of modernity based on a traumatic repression, where our social history just is a history of confinement. With the influence of Luce Irigaray, Land also does not spare in realizing the unquestionable role race and gender (like Federici) play in the understanding of the genesis of modernity: This process of displacement, which is the ultimate “base” or “infrastructure” of capital accumulation, depends on the issues of “kinship” or “marriage organization” (the sex economy of gender and race) that Marxists tend to regard as surface features of an underlying mode of production (Land, 2011, p. 59). Immanuel Kant is a great source for Land, and indeed he must be, being positioned as he is as a progenitor of modernity as we understand it. Land brings together an argument where the history of the West, based on the Kantian paradigm, would ultimately only culminate in a bourgeois civilization comprised of self-reflective minds. The thought of synthesis (and intrinsic otherness), as well as the very tightening of this worldview in its larger metaphysical system, would configure modernity as a problem. Land asserts that the Western tradition is obscurely aligned with a kind of game between culture, population, and the stability of the subject, a subject understood from the constitution of an identity (Ego), placing the masculine as its main representation. Patrilineality and patriarchy are the basic structures of this new form of social organization that underpins a double path: on the one hand, it deterritorializes and completely exonerates “primitive” (pre-modern) forms of social organization and launches them on a new axis; on the other hand, it also reduces, confines and architects an Oedipal and family-planning model that not only encloses desire, but also provides great infrastructural support for the surveillance and mastery of bodies. Enlightenment modernity, Land posits, is the result of the tension of this inhibited synthesis. It is the deep and contrived codification that the system of exploitation executes for its own maintenance, whether through the proletarian or with the “matter” of the third world. Instability and difference become the very source of endless expansion. As the editors write in the introduction to Land’s volume: When “the exterior must pass through the interior” (correlation), the escape, promised by commerce, from the repressive interiority of the Oedipal patrilineage, is recoded as a transgression of the law, transcendentalizing interiority and familialism and, thus, trapping desire in circuits, oedipally isolated ones, that provide the original source for fascist xenophobia. The potential dissolution of kinship by international trade ends in its containment in the form of nations and &#8216;races&#8217;; according to Land, neocolonialist modernity is the legacy of this failure; and the immanent end and unsurpassed apex of European civilization, as an offshoot of this correlationist compromise formation, is the Holocaust (Land, 2011, p. 9). Still, technics play a more confused and complex sense in the category of modernity. As accelerationism takes up, much of the history of recent philosophy has made an effort to better understand the technological advances that virulent capitalism has orchestrated in recent decades. Obviously, modernity not only accelerated, but it played a hugely progressive role in the technological and material advancement of societies. What accelerationism has always perceived (as Marx also notes[7]) is the destructively transformative character that markets and productivity assume in social production, and technics by no means escape this phenomenon. Technological progress, universal reason, enlightenment on the so-called treadmill, and the somewhat disastrous intimacies between reason and barbarism: these were topics discussed extensively in the 20th century. Twentieth-century Germany concentrated a social and political experience that gave fertile ground for, even an exigency for, philosophical thinking. The Weimar Republic, the Nazi-Fascist State, the Second World War and the Holocaust are well-known examples of this turbulent moment. Both the Frankfurt School, and especially that of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in The Dialectic of Enlightenment , as well as the so-called authors of the Conservative Revolution, are talking about the same process, the same moment: technical progress, the instrumentalization of reason, technical capitalism in modernity. The Dialectic of Enlightenment remains a remarkable assessment of this troubled period, and Adorno would continue his project of critically reading the epistemology of Edmund Husserl while Horkheimer critiqued the logical neopositivism of the Vienna School. We will not delve into Frankfurtian themes here, but what the authors leave behind that is of inestimable value is an awareness of the indefatigable destruction of Enlightenment and the real historical weakness of understanding the theoretical thought of the time: The enigmatic disposition of the technologically educated masses to allow themselves to be dominated by the fascination of some despotism, their self-destructive affinity with racist paranoia, all this misunderstood absurdity manifests the weakness of the power of understanding of current theoretical thinking (Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1985, p. 13). It is relevant to point out that, for his part, Heidegger does not see technology in an ahistorical way, instead understanding a key difference between Greek techne and modern technology. While this Greek form allowed the unhidden – from something hidden in the original – to be situated within the scope of poiesis , in harmony with an innate dimension, as well as defying natural physis , the modern form of technology for Heidegger is the final climactic result of Western metaphysics itself. Gestell , enframing, consolidates itself as the total arrangement of everything in the world. Modernity, as the time &#8220;of the obscuration of the world, the flight of the gods, the destruction of the Earth, the massification of man, the odious suspicion against all that is free and creative&#8221; (Heidegger, 1999, p. 65), launches and installs one of the most important questions for Heidegger&#8217;s thought: the question of technics. The history of modernity is also a metaphysical journey in the metaphysicalization of technics: the modern world inaugurates the era of informatization, of the simulated, of the non-world as the final stage of the technological and scientific advances of the industrial revolution. The question of metaphysical disposition is central to Heidegger and comprises much of his perception of technology, and in The Question Concerning Technology from 1953, Heidegger will eternalize himself as a most fearsome omen for present discussions of technology and techne . The humanism that founds the project of modernity is one of representation, where things are no longer things, but rather objects for a subject, and at worst, devices for the subject to become master of and dominate. Heidegger brings this understanding into his discussion of technology: first, the process of transformation he outlines is one of the relationship between us and the world, where the object can only come into being from the moment it is represented (when it becomes a resource), and second, he extracts a certain ‘will to power’ from Nietzsche, asserting that the technical mastery of the world occurs by way of nihilism, by the transformation of being into valuation, by losing agency and displacing the world. Ernst Jünger was an author of the so-called Conservative Revolutionary Movement (or Conservative Revolution) in Germany who also made an interesting theoretical contribution to the comparative relation between technology and modernity. Junger makes use of Fronterlebnis (front experience) in the First World War, where he was a combatant, to reconcile his ultra-reactionary political character with modern technology. The historian Jeffrey Herf points out in Reactionary Modernism an incessant desire in German thought of that period to bring together modern technology and the principle of kultur , exorcising Enlightenment reason and dignifying a political project that could be both reactionary (traditionalist, authoritarian) and technologically modern. In the European context of the time, at least, the question of technology would find itself divided typically into two ideal traditions, according to Herf. The Promethean tradition is linked to the myth of Prometheus, the Greek titan responsible for stealing fire, and it subordinates the domain of nature for mainly human ends, desiring total emancipation. The Faustian tradition unmasks these arguments and inscribes an attempt to overcome this nihilism of technical domination. As Victor Coelho points out: Thus, in the context of Germany&#8217;s crisis after the Great War of 1914-1918, Faustian analyses are favored, opposing faith in the rationality of history (in its supposed laws or dialectics), a ‘destinationist’ vision of technology and history, rejecting ‘any libertarian vision of neutrality or the purely instrumental character of technology [&#8230;] as well being hostile to Western liberal, democratic and universalist values (Coelho, 2017, p. 6). For his part, Jünger will differentiate himself precisely because he brings an aspect of vitalism to technology. The type of the worker, as the consummation of the subject&#8217;s metaphysical aspect, is a unique element for Jünger, who identifies an explicitly warlike character in technology, preaching a need to exalt this warrior vitalism in a consummation of war. In the Lebenphilosophie war would be a widespread sacrifice, and Jünger brings a glorification of the industrial world, of incessant technology, seeing a new potential for his reactionary ideals. The Gestalt (figure) or &#8220;type&#8221; (as presented in his work The Worker ) he proposes is a purported solution to the incessant modernization and acceleration of the sacrifice of individual subjectivities, in favor of the total mobilization of technicism, industrial production, and war. Enlightenment rationality is entirely replaced by the technical universe, under a certain cultic dimension: Finally, the ideal totality, as a ‘third instance’ (Humboldt) between citizens and contingency, would give way again to an ontological totality: the totality of work; and the idyllic nature, index of the lost totality and present in the reactionary neo-romantic movements, gives way to the planned nature of the work (Coelho, 2017, p. 8). Yet, does every criticism of modernity or technology imply reactionarism? How can we carry out a serious discussion of these themes without leaning towards ultra-reactionary positions like Jünger &#8216;s or technophobic ones like Heidegger&#8217;s? Yuk Hui &#8216;s recent work The Question Concerning Technology in China: An Essay on Cosmotechnics concentrates several of the themes discussed here so far and mediates a harmonious understanding between the natural and the artificial. By bringing the history of China and positioning a diversity of technical thought with so-called ‘cosmotechnics’, Hui inaugurates a new moment in the heart of the debate. At the same time, it presents contemporary China as a space for the emptying of ancient cosmotechnics – much more in line with the cosmic and natural dimension. But Nick Land&#8217;s departure to China at the beginning of the century also complicates this story, as he has treated the giant red dragon with exquisite exaltation and positivity since the 1990s. Land writes presently on China in an exactly opposite way to Hui: for Land, it is China who will lead this new moment of capitalism that is increasingly detaching itself from the domain of modernity. The second part of this article will focus on more direct comparisons between these two authors, while articulating the different understandings of posthumanism and Sinofuturism in the work of both. &nbsp; Sinofuturism in the Anthropocene: overcoming modernity In Technics and Time, 1 Bernard Stiegler recounts the history of Western philosophy from the perspective of technics. Modernity as characterized by Stiegler is wrought by technical unconsciousness, to which he proposes the opposition of technical consciousness, which would be attached to time and the way that finitude and technics are related. Stiegler writes that since Plato, the relationship between technics and anamnesis, or the doctrine of recollection, has converged in the &#8220;economy of the soul&#8221;. However, it is Hui who points out that this anamnestic character of technics in Western history did not apply to the context of the East, where, despite the calendar devices and other similar technical objects, the technical lineages and interpretations of time in the East determine completely different configurations of technics. Hui is responsible for synthesizing post-Heideggerian debates that are more than relevant contemporarily, but the true key to understanding the pace at which technical modernity operates is at another historical level. It is well-known that the East is radically distinguished in terms of its development of metaphysics and philosophy. Eastern philosophy did not take time into account, instead establishing another relationship with historicity, that is, the ability to think as a “historical being”. This absence of time and presence of a discourse on historicity in Eastern metaphysics was one of the great themes of Keiji Nishitani, a Japanese philosopher of the Kyoto School and student of Heidegger. In the introduction to The Question Concerning Technology in China , Hui presents not only Nishitani, but also Mou Zongsan, another important oriental thinker for marking the fault lines between metaphysical thought in the West and East. For these thinkers, Geschichtlichkeit (historicity) is established by a relationship with so-called individual time, but Nishitani&#8217;s dilemma emerges when he tries to articulate an overcoming of modernity but instead ends up dangerously close to metaphysical fascism. Nishitani understands technology as a gateway to nihility, just as Heidegger thought, and the Buddhism defended by Nishitani proposes sunyata (emptiness) to finally transcend such nihility. But for Hui, in such transcendence, time would lose all meaning. The Weltgeschichtlichkeit (world historicity) would also lose meaning since, as Stiegler puts it, these two historicities are the direct result of technics, and are not possible without a retention system: there is no awareness of the bridges between Dasein and historicity without perceiving Dasein and technics. Mou Zongsan&#8217;s insights into Western philosophy find expression in &#8220;Dao and Cosmos: The Principle of The Moral&#8221;, where he understands Chinese cosmology as a moral ontology. Zongsan establishes that it is not a philosophy of nature that arises from this cosmology, but a certain moral metaphysics of thought based especially on the Qian[8] and the hexagram.[9] Zongsan was one of the main philosophers of neo-Confucianism, the attempt by Chinese philosophy to further enhance its philosophical history and systems with Western philosophy, which was encroaching more and more at the beginning of the 20th century. In his reading of Kant, Zongsan attests that the division of phenomenon and noumenon marks a fundamental distinction between the way that modernity has spread through world history in the West and East: According to Kant, intellectual intuition belongs only to God, not to humans. I think this is really surprising. I reflect on Chinese philosophy, and if we follow Kant&#8217;s thought, I think Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism all confirm that humans have intellectual intuition; otherwise it would not be possible to become a saint, Buddha or Zhenren (Zongsan, 1991). In general terms, the reflections of and questions raised by these two philosophers in large part accompany the problem of technics and modernity considered here. Can absolute nothingness create a new world history and purge Western modernity? Can Chinese philosophy possibly reconfigure itself by absorbing modern science and technology? Hui notices the following: Nishitani&#8217;s answer leads to a proposal of total war as a strategy to overcome modernity, something that was taken up again as a slogan of the philosophers of the Kyoto school before the Second World War. This is what I call metaphysical fascism, which arises from a misdiagnosis of the question of modernity, and it is something we must avoid at all costs (Hui, 2016, p. 43). For Hui, these attempts to overcome modernity especially fail by not taking the issue of technics and technology seriously. Hui asserts that the technological unconscious of modernity as a project will only continue to dominate other cultures and civilizations, and that this process of rampant modernization will even become increasingly inevitable, largely because the technological unconscious is enacted by global militarism and economic competition. The issue is not simply to develop new narratives or to look at world history from points of view beyond Europe: Hui insists on distinguishing himself from pure perspectivism, and rather to confront this order of time in the manner of overcoming modernity for modernity itself, a reappropriation of modern technologies and the technological unconscious. Hui&#8217;s technological thinking proposes two categories that need to be qualified in what follows: cosmotechnics and technodiversity. He starts from an initiative to think a general philosophy of Chinese technology, and in the face of the historical context of modernity to show how other places experience a vastly different space-time from that of other countries (as industrialization shows). Hui&#8217;s work intends to conceptualize a counterpart to Heidegger&#8217;s conception of technics and to think of a new possible way for the construction of an appropriate Chinese philosophy of technology. What Hui makes clear is that in regions like China, technics, in the sense that we understand it today, or at least as defined by European philosophers, never even existed; in other words, technics as a generalized human activity and an activity present since evolution can be confirmed, but philosophical conceptions of technics cannot be assumed to be universal. What Hui calls the &#8220;vision of Western technology&#8221; is not just from modern Germanism, but from Hellenic philosophy, and technics as an ontological category needs to be situated in relation to this longer and larger configuration, the cosmology proper to a Western culture from which it arose. The division of mythos and logos , made explicit in the Athenian academy and found in Plato and Socrates, founds an initial moment to think about cosmology, and Hui believes that &#8220;[t]he dialectical movement between rationality and myth constitutes the dynamics of philosophy, without which there would only be positive sciences&#8221; (Hui, 2016, p. 11). The hypothesis that Hui however proposes is that despite the distance that philosophy tries to enact between it and mythology, what actually occurs is another story: &#8220;In Europe, the attempt of philosophy to separate from mythology is precisely conditioned by mythology, meaning that mythology reveals the germinal form of such a way of philosophizing&#8221; (Hui, 2016, p. 11). If the Western view of technics and technology differs from Heidegger&#8217;s analysis of a poetic moment and another of reserve, and since its foundation is aligned with cosmological mythologization, what myths then inform this technology? Hui establishes Prometheanism as the founding myth: the theft of fire ( techne ) by the man-friendly titan, Prometheus, the assault of the celestial kingdom, of the cosmic natural earth, technics originating from a radically violent process. There are several Greek myths about Prometheus, but in the end, they inform a universal Prometheanism that assumes that all cultures start from this same, originally Greek view of techne , and Hui counteracts this with the Chinese tradition: Unlike Greek mythology, then, in which the Titan revolted against the gods, bestowing fire and livelihood to humans, thus elevating them above animals, in Chinese mythology there was no such rebellion and no such transcendence granted; this endowment is seen instead, due to the benevolence of the ancient sages (Hui, 2016, p. 16) Due to this perception that different relationships between the human and its environment inform different conditions of cosmology and consequently of technics, Hui proposes the concept of cosmotechnics, one example being Chinese medicine that uses principles of cosmology to describe its scientificity, like yin-yang, wuxing, harmony, etc. Technics are always cosmotechnical, and it is the unification between the cosmic order and the moral order that is marked by technical activity, whereby the concept of cosmotechnics automatically breaks a given paradigm between technics and nature. The only distinction between contemporary technology and cosmotechnics then is the mediating element between the human and the cosmos, which today is capital itself. Technodiversity ends up designating the meeting of various cosmotechnics, the harmony between localities, regions and varied technical visions. For Hui then, contemporary accelerationism is nothing more than an update of Prometheanism: Some recent work has tried to recover what it calls &#8216;Prometheanism&#8217;, decoupling the social critique of capitalism from denigrating technology and asserting the power of technology to free us from constraints and contradictions or from modernity. This doctrine is often identified with, or at least closely related to, the notion of &#8216;accelerationism&#8217;. But if such a response to technology and capitalism is applied globally, as if Prometheus was a universal cultural figure, it risks perpetuating a more subtle form of colonialism (Hui, 2016, p. 12). Also related to accelerationism, the belief in and commitment to technology as a way of overcoming modernity offers interesting horizons in the contexts of extreme Asia and Europe itself. It is not intended here to see accelerationism as a philosophical or political proposal, but as a phenomenon that already occurs historically and as the main temporal axis of cosmopolitical contemporaneity. If the mediation between the human and the cosmos in the pre-modern past was carried out between symbolic and other exchange elements, the current order is one where such a mediation is carried out by capital. The history of capitalism itself is legible as a feedback loop of such a mediated process, drawing itself in periodic cycles. Eric Hobsbawm in Age of Extremes presents this perspective well in his historiographical analysis, where when “hot” episodes of European capitalism led to the crisis of the beginning of the 20th century, when this capitalistic dynamic is accentuated, the allergic reactions to liberal capitalism offer futures (or perhaps pasts, as the neo-reactionaries bet[10]) and much engagement is produced towards confronting the macropolitical structures of modernity (nation states, democracy, etc). Social democracy, fascism and Soviet socialism can be seen as the main ways of overcoming European capitalism in this period, all three sharing a common element: the periodic unification of State and Market. Placing economic planning as essential in this context, Keynesianism in the U.S. also indicated the crucial relevance of state presence in macroeconomic modeling: Hobsbawm even wagers the impossibility of any post-1929 state leader not to dignify the need for the presence of the state in economic structures. On the other hand, the so-called ‘third world’ experienced other formidable temporal experiences, with their own contradictions and specific paradoxes. Capital can try to raise itself as a universal element and globalizing force, but the inherent dialectic in the social development of these other countries provided the possibility to contradict it and produce other orders of the greater historical spirit, indicating that it is also in and through capitalism itself that it is possible to run away. It remains to be seen where and when. The growing intimacies between accelerationist projects and the Far East express this link between “Asian productivity” and technological development. Conclusion As a final hypothesis of this article, in general terms it is seen that the processes of modernization in countries and contexts different from those of the European and Western axis produced internal developments of their own, and in their own contradictoriness a movement of overcoming arose. In this sense, the thought of technics is essential for these processes, and this different movement can be seen as postmodernization, or postmodernity. This ‘post-modernization’ presents its historical, geopolitical and philosophical evidence in the so-called ‘Asian tigers’ (China, Korea and Japan), especially due to the rigorous presence of economic planning within their models. The historical and cultural characteristics of these countries produce a synthesis of experience contradictory to the main Western axis (modernization as a process made by globalization, political power, and Europe colonization); instead, post-modernization as a process appears as an amalgamation between the productive systems of capitalism and socialism. Hiroki Azuma, when talking about the emergence of otaku culture in 1980s Japan, perceives postmodern culture as fundamental, and a direct result of the capitalist acceleration in Japanese society in the 1980s.[11] Azuma however seeks to differentiate this context from the concept of postmodernism commonly used: his point is rather to treat it as a complex mixture of structuralism, Marxism, consumer theories and critical theory that characterize the phenomenon and the way these &#8220;waves&#8221; manifested themselves, in France in the 1960s, in the U.S. in the 1970s, and imported to Japan in 1980. Thus, postmodernism took another form of manifestation, even becoming a fashion aesthetic aligned with a consumerist narcissism that permeated Japanese society in the 1980s: For example, as the modern insights of humanity have never fully penetrated Japan, it can adapt to the collapse of the concept of subjectivity with little resistance. In this way, Japan emerges in the 20 th century as a leading nation, boasting a fully matured consumer society and technological prowess (Azuma, 2009, p. 17). Now, Nick Land may have become the great villain of continental philosophy, but he is also a prescient predictor of the contemporary process. His work in the 1990s can be divided into three major moments: one more aligned with a reading of Kant, another fully immersed in Deleuze &amp; Guattari, and the last being the experimental and occult phase of the CCRU. Land writes about the case of China in 1992&#8217;s &#8220;Circuitries&#8221;, but it&#8217;s in the celebrated 1994 “Meltdown” that Neo-China is finally mentioned: Neo-China rises from the future. [&#8230;] The superiority of Far Eastern Marxism. While the Chinese materialist dialectic denegativizes itself in the direction of schizophrenizing systems dynamics, progressively dissipating the historical fate of hierarchies in Tao-soaked special economic zones, a re-Hegelianized Western Marxism degenerates from a critique of political economy into a sympathetic monotheology of power, aligning itself with fascism against deregulation. The left drowns in nationalist conservatism, smothering its vestigial capacity for “hot” speculative mutation in a “cold” and depressive swamp of blame culture (Land, 2011, p. 447-48). With his acid style, blending theory and fiction[12], Land realizes “Meltdown” as both a philosophical text and as a great hyperstitious[13] work; in particular, “Meltdown” perceives the capitalist boom of the Sino-Pacific in conjunction with the automated integration of a global economy that certainly breaks the &#8220;neocolonial&#8221; order (in Land&#8217;s terms) of the modern metropolis. Land realizes that the globalization of the late 1990s, rampant technological advancement and the rise of China represents a certain aspect of the deterritorialization of hyperfluid Capital to a planetary state, stripping the first world of neocolonial privileges, deteriorating welfare states, and encouraging neoliberalism into a final stage, influencing &#8220;the release of cultural toxins that accelerate the melting process in a vicious circuit&#8221; (Land, p. 449). The human history presented by Land seems to extend into at least 3 forms of confinement: the first is that of the socius itself, the violent way that modernity installed itself with the consequent marriage between reason and experience as well as the sublime and terror; the second is the way that desire is trapped in a constant repression of human structures: ego, family, Oedipus, where the body is inscribed as a social micropod; and finally, geotrauma, the frightening awareness of how humanity is the result of successive biological accidents that culminated in a complete civilizational deformation. As Nietzsche already suggested, the structure and manner in which the body is used are motives for the neurotic afflictions inherent in human experience. Not even the voice escapes this game, since the bipedal head played a fundamental role in preventing vertebral-perceptual linearity and the human larynx in inhibiting virtual speech. The human voice, in simple terms, is the everyday and constant proliferation of the traumatic role of terrestrial evolution towards the beings known as humans. Years later, with the emergence of concepts such as the Human Security System and the Cathedral, the web of repressive and domesticating social history ends in an even scarier and more neurotic organization, but with an admittedly revolutionary and highly relentless potential: capital. Land is a complete anti-humanist, a staunch critic of anthropocentrism, and while Hui does not exactly deal with the subject, he relegates humanity to a current stage of need for symbiosis with both the ecological universe and the technical world, perhaps approaching a mediating position between various converging trends (humanisms x post- and transhumanisms), like Donna Haraway. The key differences between Land and Hui amount to their differential cosmopolitical understanding of the forces that operate on the technical matrix of contemporaneity, Hui being a staunch critic of this forced globalization and Land an expert enthusiast for the process. It is Land who most identifies Sinofuturism as an important symptom of contemporaneity. As a conclusive hypothesis, the explosion of the Sino-Pacific with the Chinese rise in the world market expresses a thesis that can be called the ‘end of unilateral globalization’ (or post-modernization), where the elementary mixture of state and market in the Chinese model indicates something really new happening, a hyperstitious projection of the future that is implanted into the contemporary via China. Maybe this projection is that of developed, real capitalism, which has emerged by inhibiting a series of elements from European and Western modernity that no longer served it. If the West has “degraded” itself in a completely neoliberalizing bet, true capitalism (as it was in Europe at its beginning, with a massive state presence) is currently emerging from extreme Asia. Things like Carl Schmitt&#8217;s influence in Chinese schools of thought, along with a growing means of organization that illustrate other ways of thinking about multiculturalism, democracy, and human rights (aspects dear to our new phase of modernity, especially after the horrors of war and the implementation of organizations such as the UN) make China a living example for the way out of modernity via the acceleration of the flows of capitalism. In this way, Chinese socialist modernization (see Jinping, 2019, p. 13) appears much closer to the understanding of a New Economic Formation[14] with a completely unprecedented social formation, one of a different kind of modernity, or perhaps realizing a proper form of “post-modernity” itself. NOTES [1] From German; reference to the Enlightenment thought of Immanuel Kant. [2] Concept of the philosopher of science Isabelle Stengers which attempts to realign the natural and/or cosmic elements with politics. [3] Authors such as Julius Evola, René Guenon and the most recent Aleksandr Dugin compose this picture of so-called traditionalism. They are usually related to the varied mysticisms and occultisms of pre-modern civilizations. [4] Influenced by the so-called ontological turn, the perspectivists can be seen as authors more invested in indigenous perspectivism and with ecological propositions, such as Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Marco Antônio Valentim, Philipe Descola, and Bruno Latour. [5] Flora Tristan, a contemporary of the Internationals and the workers’ movement, is another author who points out similar diagnoses in the 19th century. [6] It is hard to define accelerationism as an autonomous movement or school of thought. In general, it can be defined as the perceptual horizon that it is by accelerating capitalism itself it is possible to overcome it. The concept gained strength in the last decade of the 20th century due to the informational expansion of computers; famous and inspiring authors of this set of ideas are now identified as a research unit of philosophers at the University of Warwick in the 1990s, the CCRU (Center for Research in Cyber Culture). [7] See Marx (1848): “…in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while the free trade system is destructive. It breaks down old nationalities and pushes the antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to an extreme point. In a word, the free trade system accelerates the social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote for free trade.” [8] One of the eight structural trigrams of the I Ching.

[11] In a note in Introduction to Reading Hegel about Japanese and US societies, Alexandre Kojève offers a very similar perspective. [12] One of the hallmarks of the CCRU’s work is the mixture of fictional elements and philosophy. The idea of theory-fiction indicates the incorporation of fictional elements in reality. [13] The best definition of hyperstition can be made by the CCRU itself: “There is no difference in principle between a universe, a religion and a hoax. All involve manifestation engineering, or practical fiction, that is unbelievable. Nothing is true, because everything is in production. Because the future is a fiction, it has a more intense reality than the present or the past. The CCRU uses and is used by Hyperstition to colonize the future, traffic with the virtual and continually reinvent itself” (CCRU, 2015, p. 9).

"Curtis Yarvin, Political Theorist",Tablet Magazine,31/03/2022,https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/red-pill-prince-curtis-yarvin,"n his first public appearance after five years of semiofficial banishment, Curtis Yarvin began to cry. It was late February 2020 and Yarvin was the special guest at a live podcast in Los Angeles. A graphic promoting the event shows the computer engineer turned political philosopher, then 46 years old, wearing his black leather motorcycle jacket and wire-framed glasses and staring out with practiced intensity. Over Yarvin’s left shoulder floats a bust of the deceased rapper Lil Peep. The moody digital aesthetic is called vaporwave. Ma, Pa, have you heard of vaporwave? It is a very of-the-moment style that uses retro computer graphics to evoke the feeling of haunting nostalgia for a vanishing human presence. The metaphor was apt. In 2014, Yarvin—who had spent seven years blogging about politics and society under the name Mencius Moldbug—went silent, shifting his attention back to his grand project of building a functional software stack called Urbit that promised to revolutionize computing. But his political pronouncements soon caught up to him. In 2016, after the second planned talk at a computer programming conference was canceled on account of his political views, Yarvin found himself writing lines like: “I am not an ‘outspoken advocate for slavery,’ a racist, a sexist or a fascist.” As anyone who’s been on the internet lately can tell you, a person who must publicly deny that they are a fascist has already lost. When the invitations stopped coming, Yarvin didn’t protest. “When I invited him to be a guest at that event, he was truly radioactive,” the podcast’s organizer, a young intellectual entrepreneur named Justin Murphy, told me recently. The scene brought out LA art hipsters, connoisseurs of civilizational decline, and PayPal founder Peter Thiel. The billionaire, who was one of the first investors in Facebook and has been a longtime patron of Yarvin’s, drank Pabst Blue Ribbon and ate pizza. Thiel’s car idled outside the club, engine on, driver behind the wheel, ready in case the need arose for a sudden exit. Rumor has it that Thiel takes this precaution wherever he goes, but it was not out of place that evening. Murphy, who spent several years in his 20s participating in militant “black bloc” anarchist protests, was worried antifa might show up to protest the event. The night went off without a hitch. Yarvin had chosen an ideal venue to reemerge, with podcasts providing one of the only channels left to reach the public now that the glossy magazines, publishing houses, and other arteries for circulating new ideas had been choked off by the narrowing band of acceptable opinions. Depending on what circles you run in, it can seem like everyone now has an opinion about Curtis Yarvin—and that includes me. We were introduced in 2017 when I received a short, unsolicited email from him calling me a “fake writer” working in a “fake century.” The email arrived after I’d published an essay that mentioned Yarvin a handful of times and referred to him as “an architect of antidemocratic, Neoreactionary politics.” The brashness, it turned out, was just Yarvin’s way of getting my attention. Thus began an occasional correspondence that has included a handful of interactions over the last five years. And so, without giving it a great deal of thought, I added myself to the extended network of people being courted, outraged, and shaped by the man and his work. Like Niccolò Machiavelli, to whom he is sometimes compared, Yarvin defines himself as an amoral realist who invented a new theory of government that upends established doctrines of political morality. Starting in the late 2000s, his name—not his real name, he was still known then by his blogging pseudonym—began to be whispered among some of the most powerful people in the country, a secret society made up of disaffected members of the American elite. Shortly after Donald Trump entered the White House, reports started to circulate that Yarvin was secretly advising Trump strategist Steve Bannon. His writing, according to one article, had established the “theoretical groundwork for Trumpism.” Yarvin denied the rumors, sometimes playfully and at other times strenuously. But he was consistent in his criticisms of the Trumpian approach to politics. Mass populist rallies and red MAGA hats struck him as merely a weak imitation of democratic energies that had already died out. “Trump is a throwback from the past, not an omen of the future,” he wrote in 2016. “The future is grey anonymous bureaucrats, more Brezhnev every year.” What Yarvin is, if one wants to be accurate, is the founder of neoreaction, an ideological school that emerged on the internet in the late 2000s marrying the classic anti-modern, anti-democratic worldview of 18th-century reactionaries to a post-libertarian ethos that embraced technological capitalism as the proper means for administering society. Against democracy. Against equality. Against the liberal faith in an arc of history that bends toward justice. Instead, neoreactionaries subscribe to the classical idea that history moves in cycles. In an era when the iconic Shepard Fairey portrait of Barack Obama captured the HOPE of the nation, Yarvin and his followers were busy explaining why liberal democracy was already doomed. Unlike some of the other neoreactionary writers that emerged in the last 20 years, Yarvin possessed a style that, even when discoursing at great length on the gold standard or obscure historical matters, never suggested powdered wigs. He wrote like what he was: a hyperintellectual Ivy League autodidact and wiseass tech geek masking his childhood insecurities with an aura of infallibility, who shared the same set of subcultural and sitcom references found in anyone else his age. At its best, this approach made difficult ideas accessible—not to mention viral. In one of his earliest blog posts, Yarvin birthed the now-ubiquitous meme of “the red pill,” a metaphor he borrowed from The Matrix movies and turned into a worldwide catchphrase describing the revelation of a suppressed truth that shatters progressive illusions and exposes a harsh underlying reality. In Yarvin’s worldview, what keeps American democracy running today is not elections but illusions projected by a set of institutions, including the press and universities, that work in tandem with the federal bureaucracy in a complex he calls the Cathedral. “The mystery of the Cathedral,” Yarvin writes, “is that all the modern world’s legitimate and prestigious intellectual institutions, even though they have no central organizational connection, behave in many ways as if they were a single organizational structure.” Living Americans might be able to glean a sense of the phenomenon Yarvin describes in the current public discourse. It has often seemed in recent years that every few weeks has brought a new instance in which journalists and experts instantaneously, almost magically converged on shared talking points related to the hysteria du jour—cycling through moral crusades to free children from cages at the U.S. border, save the post office from a fascist coup, label the filibuster a tool of white supremacy, and so on. The power of the Cathedral is that it cannot be seen because it is located everywhere and nowhere, baked into the architecture of how we live, communicate, and think. Related WikipediaWikipedia News section icon The Cathedral or the Bizarre America’s experiments with democracy and oligarchy have both failed, leaving only one option byCurtis Yarvin The night that Yarvin reemerged onto the scene at the LA event, the story that moved him to tears concerned the life of the English writer Freda Utley, who became a communist in 1928—an era, he observed archly, when “anyone who was smart or cool was a communist.” Utley moved to the Soviet Union and a few years later her husband was arrested and shipped to the gulag never to be seen again. She fled to the United States with her infant son and tried to warn her friends that their imagined utopia was really a police state. “Of course, her friends are like, ‘Do I know you?’ Who is this anti-Soviet person knocking at the door? They’re like, ‘Fuck you.’” Yarvin arrived at the moral of his story: “You really shouldn’t expect the material rewards of success to come along with the spiritual rewards of telling the truth.” He swallowed a sob. “You really shouldn’t,” he said, and wiped a tear from his eye. In Yarvin’s parable, he is both the betrayed figure of Utley, martyred for telling the truth, and the above-it-all narrator explaining how the world really works. To his readers, his immense, fortresslike body of work offers one of the only redoubts where they can glimpse the realities of power behind the political circus. To his skeptics, he is a minor fraud whose claims to be a truth-telling iconoclast belie a fundamental affinity with the status quo. Yarvin’s calls to do away with democracy and turn, say, Elon Musk into America’s new CEO king—that’s just the liberal technocratic system we already have on speed, an acceleration into the most dystopian aspects of the endless neoliberal present. To his critics, he is, as noted, a fascist. They point to a handful of his statements from a decade ago, including one in which he argued that certain races were better suited to slavery than others, and to the fact that the central pillar of his outlook is an avid opposition to the principles of democracy and equality. Yarvin, they say, is not a victim but the sender-off to the gulags; behind his tears, he plots to oppress minorities and tear down whatever remains of liberal democracy. The essence of Yarvin as a historical figure begins not with his politics but his talents as a computer engineer, or programmer, the latter of which is his preferred label since he sees himself as a builder of things that work, not simply a manipulator of symbols. To separate his roots in technology from the politics he developed is to miss what is most powerful about him—his understanding of the hidden designs behind the systems of knowledge and power that keep both computers and societies running. The universal rule that he deduced is almost mystical in its simplicity: Order is good, not merely in an instrumental sense because it leads to virtuous outcomes; it is good in itself. Whatever leads to more of it is also good, while anything that produces disorder is bad. While conservatives who have come to embrace Yarvin speak of restoring natural rights and using state power to direct the common good, for him, “it is impossible to go directly from hypocrisy to morality. A cleansing bath of amoral realism must intervene.” Yarvin is not a nationalist or a populist, nor even a conservative. Rather, he is the signature example of a political theorist born after the death of 20th-century mass political movements, on the unsettled terrain of the internet. Whether you like it or not, Yarvin is the philosopher of, at the very least, our near future. The father of neoreaction was raised in the bosom of the American state. His paternal grandparents were Jewish American communists. Yarvin’s father worked for the U.S. government as a foreign service officer, which took his family overseas to Portugal, Cyprus, and the Dominican Republic. His mother was a Protestant from Westchester County who eventually also joined the civil service, as did Yarvin’s stepfather. The progeny of this Jewish-WASP-Stalinist, civil service, Cold War liberal American heritage was a child math prodigy and computer whiz who liked to write poetry. It didn’t make social life easy, especially when his family returned to the United States just as he began high school. “I had already skipped one grade back in Fairfax County and they did an admission test, so I skipped two more and then I’m 11 in ninth grade,” he told me. “Then we come back to the States and I go to an American public high school in Columbia, Maryland, and I’m a 12-year-old sophomore, which is definitely wack.” At 15, Yarvin entered college as part of Johns Hopkins’ longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth. A year later, he transferred to Brown University in Rhode Island as a legacy admission to the Ivy League liberal arts college, where his parents had met in the mid-’60s. After graduating, it was on to a computer science Ph.D. program at Berkeley. He dropped out after a year and a half to take a tech job at the height of the go-go ’90s dot-com era. In late adolescence, Yarvin had a formative experience on an early internet message board called Usenet. “It was a decentralized system, and more importantly it had this amazing form of admission control because everyone on it was an engineering student or worked at a tech company or something,” Yarvin told me. He participated on forums like talk.bizarre, absorbing the inside jokes and new iterative patterns of thinking that were being developed on the outpost of a still-innovative and experimental digital culture. Occasionally he posted a poem or short piece of fiction to the board. The end came in 1993 when America Online, the first mass internet provider, offered Usenet access to its subscribers—resulting in a flood of uninitiated, unwashed provincials overrunning the community. “You had this sort of de facto aristocracy that didn’t know it was an aristocracy, and then it fell apart.” “After the dot-com crash, I was left with a newly acquired girlfriend (who would become my wife), a few hundred thousand dollars, and a place in San Francisco,” Yarvin told me of his early career. The buyout came from his job at a mobile software company that was founded in 1996 as Libris before changing its name to Unwired Planet, and then Phone.com. The settlement was “considerably less than ‘fuck you’ money,” Yarvin said, but enough to finance an extended self-education in history and political theory that was attained by searching through Google’s ‘library of everything, ever,’ which was brand new at the time. “My ideas really came from reading the Austrian School—Mises and Rothbard—and then Hoppe. Hoppe opened a kind of door to the pre-revolutionary world for me,” Yarvin has said. A German-born political theorist and leading proponent of Austrian School economics, Hans-Hermann Hoppe has called himself an anarcho-capitalist, a title borrowed from his mentor Murray Rothbard. Hoppe theorized a distinction between monarchy, which he defined as “privately owned government,” and democracy, classified as “publicly owned government.” In the introduction to his 2001 book, Democracy: The God That Failed, Hoppe called “the transition from monarchy to democracy” a source of “civilizational decline.” From Hoppe, Yarvin took the idea that “all organizations, big or small, public or private, military or civilian, are managed best when managed by a single executive.” If democracy is so decrepit and ineffective, one might ask how it is that America became the world’s great superpower and maintained that position for the last century. Yarvin’s answer contains two parts: first, that nothing lasts forever. Second, while American supremacy may once have rested on innovation and growth, the country, now a bloated empire, has been surviving for decades on the power of myth-making and mass illusions. Whether or not he can be compared to Machiavelli the man, it is correct to describe Yarvin as a Machiavellian, in the meaning given to that term by the American political writer James Burnham, a one-time follower of Leon Trotsky who later became a committed anti-communist. Like the historical figures chronicled in Burnham’s book The Machiavellians: Defenders of Freedom, Yarvin believes that one of the worst aspects of democracy is the fact that it rarely exists. Because democracy is the rule of the many, and the rule of the many is inherently unstable, democracies rarely last long. Burnham argues that all complex societies are in effect oligarchies ruled by a small number of elites. To hide this fact and legitimize their rule in the eyes of the masses, oligarchies employ the powers of mystification and propaganda. Indeed, Yarvin believes that America stopped being a democracy sometime after the end of World War II and became instead a “bureaucratic oligarchy”—meaning that political power is concentrated within a small group of people who are selected not on the basis of hereditary title or pure merit but through their entry into the bureaucratic organs of the state. What remains of American democracy is pageantry and symbolism, which has about as much connection to the real thing as the city of Orlando has to Disney World. In place of a functional democratic system, Yarvin came to believe, there now exists an industrial-scale symbolic apparatus that generates the illusion of political agency necessary for society’s real rulers to carry out their business undisturbed. American voters still go to the polls to pick their leader, but the president is a ceremonial figure beholden to the permanent bureaucracy. “The structure of democratic societies creates two tiers of power,” observed the French sociologist and eminent defender of liberalism, Raymond Aron, in his appraisal of Burnham’s book. While one tier of power is made up of industrialists, military generals, and other decision-makers operating in the shadows, in public their interests are represented by the second tier made up of “those who know how to talk.” The problem identified by the Machiavellians, says Aron, is that while the talkers are not necessarily competent leaders, they nevertheless gain power because “debating regimes oil the wheels for those who know how to use words.” There you have the two paths to power in a democracy: secrecy for the plutocratic persons of action, or, for those in the public political class, skill at deceit. While Yarvin’s vision has as much or more in common with left critiques of the state dating back to the 1960s, his solutions are openly reactionary—looking back to the 17th century rather than forward to a promised socialist-utopian future. In 2007, Yarvin, writing as Mencius Moldbug, started his blog Unqualified Reservations. His themes, now clearly established, were reflected in his earliest published work: “Democracy as an Adaptive Fiction,” “Why, When, and How to Abolish the United States,” and “Against Political Freedom.” At the time, Yarvin’s paid work was still with the San Francisco-based Urbit where, with funding from Thiel, he was immersed in a yearslong project to write a new programming language from scratch and decentralize the ownership of data. Even in the Olympian culture of Silicon Valley, where the microdosing transhumanists all had startups promising to engineer a brave new humanity, Urbit’s project was considered wildly ambitious, if not a bit mad. The initial Moldbug audience was made up of fellow Silicon Valley misfits and disaffected amateur intellectuals with high-speed internet connections, the kind of people interested in his sardonic style and unconventional approach to history and political thought. Everywhere one looked in the Moldbuggian scheme, things were not what they seemed. Beneath the surface of modern progressivism, for instance, Yarvin found that the sacraments and dogmas of America’s founding Protestant religion had been preserved. The now common criticism that the liberal activist culture of wokeness is a kind of secular religion picks up on arguments Yarvin was making in 2007 about mainstream liberal universalism, which he dubbed “CryptoCalvinism.” This new techno-monarchist ideology of neoreaction developed in connection with other post-millennial intellectual movements in Silicon Valley like “post-rationalism.” By the late-2000s, while the U.S. culture and economy appeared stagnant, if not in outright decline, the technology sector was expanding its power and reach as apparently the only industry left in America still capable of innovation. The ideas coming out of the valley reflected that disparity and a growing feeling there that American liberal democracy was an obsolete operating system, impeding the tech sector’s growth and with it the march of progress. Other key figures to emerge in neoreaction included the writer Michael Anissimov, and the British philosopher Nick Land, a former Marxist and devotee of French critical theory who gave the title Dark Enlightenment to his extended study of Yarvin’s oeuvre. Adjacent to neoreaction was the digital fascism of the “alternative right,” which emerged a few years later. The alt-right, as it was also known, was another internet-based ideological movement but one that emphasized anarchic nihilism, rabid racism, and demonization of Jews. Neoreactionaries, by contrast, while comfortable expressing their own racial and ethnic bigotries, tended to downplay their political importance and eschewed the online Nazi role-playing of the alt-right as dim-witted and self-destructive. In a series of early essays, “Why I am not a White Nationalist” and “Why I am not an Anti-Semite,” Yarvin offered an analysis of those ideologies that was not entirely unsympathetic before ultimately rejecting them. How could he be a fascist, Yarvin protested, when he so clearly detested “the masses” and “the people”—two of fascism’s most celebrated subjects? Perhaps the best known of the Silicon Valley democracy skeptics was Thiel. “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” Thiel wrote in 2009. “The great task for libertarians,” he declared, “is to find an escape from politics in all its forms—from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called ‘social democracy.’” Yet for Yarvin, even though libertarianism may be right about the best way to organize society, it fails because it is unserious about power. An all-powerful state is necessary, a sovereign Leviathan of the kind envisioned by Thomas Hobbes, to impose order by force on a level of such absolute authority that it can then disappear from day-to-day life. Having concluded that democracy is a failed and dying form of governance, one that increasingly produces more disorder than order, Yarvin provided a vision for what could come next: an enlightened corporate monarchy that would only arrive after a hard reboot of the political system. It was a vision of total regime change, but one achieved without any violence or even activism since those efforts were doomed to fail and would therefore only strengthen the system they sought to overthrow. For those who believed in it, the next step was to generate the ideas that a future elite would use to run the country once it seized power. And who should the rulers be, exactly? Rather than a hereditary dynasty, Yarvin proposed the Elizabethan structure of the joint-stock company used by the British East India Company as the best means for selecting and overseeing the monarch. The state, rather than tyrannizing its subjects or being controlled by citizens who endowed its authority, “should be operated as a profitable corporation governed proportionally by its beneficiaries.” Elsewhere, he puts it differently: “I favor absolute monarchy in the abstract sense: unconditional personal authority, subject to some responsibility mechanism.” Some readers may dwell on the weight that the rather vague “some responsibility mechanism” bears in this program for the enlightened monarchies of the future. For Yarvin, the answer is always more power. While Peter Thiel has since disavowed his rejection of democracy—in public at least—and is now financing the U.S. Senate campaigns of a new breed of MAGA 2.0 populists like J.D. Vance and Blake Masters, Yarvin has not wavered. Power, according to Yarvin, is like computer code, binary. It is either on or off; final and absolute, or merely a glorified form of servitude. Even the tech giants, which he considers the only efficient organizations left in the United States, are powerless. Facebook may be able to ban anyone it wants while controlling the flow of critical information to billions of people across the globe, but Mark Zuckerberg still has to answer to midlevel government functionaries—a relationship demonstrated by the Facebook CEO’s reluctant embrace of a Democratic Party approved fact-checking apparatus. Even if Zuckerberg wanted to raise an army to stage a coup, it’s not clear what target he could strike. “[F]or all practical revolutionary purposes,” Yarvin wrote in May of 2020. “the ‘deep state’ is as decentralized as Bitcoin, and as invulnerable—to ballots and bullets alike.” Because the goal for Yarvin is to force power out of the bureaucratic shadows and make it visible, he sees the brute force approach of China’s government as a positive example. After all, what is the opposite of the U.S. deep state with its esoteric CryptoCalvinist dogmas, if not the overtly state-worshiping ideology of the Chinese Communist Party where the government’s capacity for violence is never far from the surface? It’s an analysis that for Yarvin and others of his ilk approaches its own dogma. As recently as last December, Yarvin maintained that China’s “zero-COVID” surveillance state approach to the pandemic, in which millions of people have been confined to their homes in citywide quarantines, entails ”fewer covid restrictions than citizens of the reddest American red state.” What is bizarre about the reaction to the neoreactionaries is not the perfectly understandable revulsion at this adoration of China, or at their racial and ethnic bigotries, but the outrage over their attack on democracy. Philosophers and politicians like Alexis de Tocqueville, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams, to name only three among countless figures, including many on the left, have been outspoken in their warnings about democracy’s perils. That is to say nothing of the current American ruling class, which treats ordinary people with aristocratic contempt, openly conspires to suppress reporting that might get the “wrong” candidate elected, and organizes “shadow campaigns” to undermine popular elections—all in the name of democracy. If Yarvin’s political musings are a danger to the future of American democracy, as they may well be, one can only ask what that means for the actions and statements of the people who are currently in power. The temptation to squeeze Yarvin into the premade villain costume of a contemporary morality play may be temporarily satisfying, but if its aim was to shut him down or curb his influence, it has failed. He’s back in the public sphere now with more time than ever after departing Urbit in 2019, and he has a busy schedule of podcast appearances. It seems likely, in fact, that ignoring Yarvin’s incisive diagnosis of the American political system, or reducing it to cartoonish villainy, will only benefit him and other opponents of democracy who are more than happy to see the American system continue its slow breakdown. It also misses the fatal weakness of Yarvin’s ideology: For all of its power as a systemic analysis, it contains no place for human beings. The classic question in philosophy—what is the good life?—never intrudes on Yarvin’s pursuit of designing beautiful machines. I once asked Yarvin whether he saw his computer programming and writing as drawing on different parts of his brain. “My love of computer science has always been in systems because it’s essentially architecture, you’re building something that has to have a very large component of aesthetics in it,” he told me. “You’re in a situation where maybe even more than in architecture, you know this works because it’s beautiful.” Later in the conversation, he expanded on this point. “When you’re building system software, you’re in this position of this demiurge,” he said using the term from gnostic theology for a minor, and typically false, god. The matter of the individual, not as a political subject but as a sentient, feeling agent possessing intrinsic needs and desires, seems not so much a matter Yarvin avoids as one that almost never occurs to him in his political writing. Even where his designs are most immaculate, they are somehow bereft—like a beautiful but empty city.

He also predicted that it wouldn’t matter. He pronounced America a failed state, unable to envision, let alone muster the capacity to take the kind of decisive action that, according to Yarvin, was being modeled by China’s “zero-COVID” approach to the virus. “The hard truth,” he wrote a few months later, “is that the virus is not just a test of our government. It is a test of our form of government.” The following summer, the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan while barely firing a shot. America’s trillion-dollar investment in the Afghan Security Forces was exposed as a Ponzi scheme and collapsed overnight. In the final chaotic days of the war, U.S. forces struck a deal with the Taliban, their sworn enemy of the past two decades, to provide security at the airfield where final evacuations were taking place. Shortly after that, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the airport killing 13 American service members and some 170 Afghan civilians. No general or political leader was blamed for America’s longest war ending in humiliating defeat. No one was fired or resigned. Moreover, the total lack of accountability for a catastrophic systemwide failure is, according to Yarvin, not a problem that could be solved by electing better leaders or applying more political will, because it is an essential feature of the system’s design. “Why did this happen?” Yarvin asked. “Very simply: because no one is in charge of the government.” Not the wrong people; no one. Is that possible? If things were really that bad, wouldn’t we be able to tell? Maybe not. Without losing your balance, try to work back through the many sharp reversals of public policy and elite opinion since the beginning of the pandemic. In February 2020, when Yarvin first issued his warning, it was considered a sign of right-wing racial paranoia to be worried at all about the virus in China. “The actual danger of coronavirus: fear may fuel racism and xenophobia that threaten human rights,” intoned The Washington Post. A few months later, the Great and Good changed their minds and declared the pandemic an unprecedented emergency demanding a nationwide shutdown. Schools and playgrounds were locked. Children were masked. The police were called out to break up weddings and prayer services held by religious communities that insisted on endangering the rest of the country by carrying on with their primitive rituals. Then the Black Lives Matter protests began that summer, and the switch was flipped again. Now, national leaders and public health officials donned the kente cloths of their own religious rituals and joined the throngs. A dazzling new form of Jesuitical argumentation was invented in which the crowding of tens of thousands of people together in the streets was not merely justified in spite of the risks, but redefined as a public health measure to combat the chronic threat of white supremacy and thus not in conflict with “the science.” Witnessing this spectacle, I have found it easy to picture myself as the member of a captive audience watching a parade of soldiers march by in crisp uniforms, executing their synchronized movements to form images of hammers, surface-to-air missiles, and other icons of the glorious people’s republic. Only here it was not North Korean conscripts marching but the best fed and most thoroughly educated Americans––university professors, journalists, scientists, surgeons general––who clicked their heels and pivoted in unison. How, one had to wonder in amazement, did they always stay on message even as the messaging changed so often and abruptly? Yarvin’s answer, of course, is the Cathedral. At one and the same time, the Cathedral is simply a name for the uncanny degree of agreement between the media, universities, and other organs of elite culture, and a theory explaining how the aggregate effect of that agreement is a system of Orwellian mind-control that projects an illusion of freedom so powerful it blinds people to reality. The question many people have, of course, is whether such a structure actually exists. After two years of COVID, following the disintegration of the liberal state, and the emergence of evermore eccentric ideological impositions, coordinated on what seems like an hourly basis by an invisible yet apparently all-powerful hand, which has no need to account for its nakedly visible contradictions and failures, the answer seems obvious: Either you see it, or you don’t.",33121
The butterfly revolution,Gray Mirror,07/04/2022,https://graymirror.substack.com/p/the-butterfly-revolution,"The butterfly revolution - by Curtis Yarvin - Gray Mirror The butterfly revolution | annotated by Peter graymirror.substack.com Open original article The butterfly revolution - by Curtis Yarvin - Gray Mirror The butterfly revolution Author: Curtis Yarvin Length: &bull; 8 mins April 07, 2022 Annotated by Peter Duke In early 2022, the Trump machine has become a kind of weird regime in exile . Is this strange organism learning? Maybe sort of, though so are its enemies. Item: in brazen defiance of the historic precedent of US v Humphrey’s Executor (1935), Trump recently called for the White House to be able to fire anyone in the so-called “executive branch.” Such ignorance of black-letter law is not unknown in the man! Trump may never even have heard of the Administrative Procedure Act (1946). And—is it that far from anyone to everyone ? Hm. Already, the voter can have no doubt that such holy and venerated parchments will, if a new Trump administration rears its ugly head, be utterly ravaged and spoiled like a sandcastle sacked by a dog— if Trump in 2024, once elected, can then get his ugly way. If not , of course, the paperwork will remain unchallenged, and the institutions that rule by these ancient promises will be unharmed. If the status quo is what you’re into, you’ll be popping the champagne! Will the next Trump administration truly be able to drain the swamp —will it have, once elected, the powers of FDR or more? Or the powers of Julius Caesar—which is more like what he needs? Or the powers of President Camacho—which was about the power the Deep State let “President” Trump get his hands on the first time around? It is hard to know. But one sure way to not be powerful is to— never be ready for power. Another way is to never try to take power . Let us imagine a fantasy world into which we could convert the Trump operation, as it is in early 2022, into a truly effective machine for both taking and using power. Why this is safe It is important to understand that this is not going to happen—for one reason. Donald J. Trump is not the “Trump” in the story. He is who he is. His capacities are what they are. Of course man must always know hope, but I actually knew the first Trump administration would be a farce once I realized one thing— he wasn’t selling his hotels. Here is the most important right-wing American politician since Richard Nixon—and dude isn’t even all in . Indeed you get the sense that he recognizes that the Presidency is a kind of decorative honor , like the throne of England, which would actually promote his hospitality and other businesses (licensees, really). Imagine staying in a Windsor branded hotel! The Trump brand, he must have dreamed, could be as strong as that . Given that the Presidency has actually totally trashed Trump’s brand, he has probably given up on this one. But you never know. The fellow has certainly drunk deeply at the well of the power of positive thinking—which has served him well, up to a point. Alas, Trump 2024, if he wins, will be nothing but another expression of the Peter Principle. Liberals do not need to fear him. Reactionaries can give up all their useless hopes. Therefore, this document is safe—Trump will never do anything like this. Whew! But I won’t disguise my belief that someone should. Someone worthy of the task, of course. An optimistic framing of one Trumpian future Trump did a great job! He made America great again! But his enemies have gotten stronger, too. Well—America was always great. But now, starting in 2025, we’re going to make America insanely great . And there’s only one way you can do that. We’ve got to risk a full power start —a full reboot of the USG. We can only do this by giving absolute sovereignty to a single organization —with roughly the powers that the Allied occupation authorities held in Japan and Germany in the fall of 1945. This level of centralized emergency power worked to refound a nation then , for them . So it should work now , for us . What Trump is going to do is to build this regime-in-exile or occupation authority as a private and (needless to say) peaceful institution—a larva. By winning a Presidential election, he will then install it in office. Metamorphosing into a beautiful butterfly, this larva will perform the feat that eluded Trump’s first regime—turning office into power . As soon as it takes symbolic power, the butterfly will be ready, willing and able to take actual power—to actually make America great again. You have seen nothing— nothing . Doing this will require powers in the Presidency that have not been seen in the lives of those now living. It will be a kind of restoration of the historic office. It will, in fact, require the executive powers of Washington, Lincoln and FDR—or even more. These three Presidents, and to some extent a few more, were almost true CEOs of the executive branch. Their monarchical regimes then decayed into oligarchies, each of which was rebooted by the next monarchy. By the clock, we are about due for another. Trump in 2017 took office ; he took about 0.01% of power . If Trump in 2021 wants to have more than 0.001% of power—his enemies have gotten stronger, too—the only way he can do it is to take 100% . To take it all at once —completely legally . Again, the real Donald J. Trump would never have the guts to even think of doing this. (And he’s just too old.) So it’s safe to use him as a picturesque example. The regime in internal exile What we’re going to do is turn the Trump entourage into a regime in internal exile . While in exile, this regime will be a larva—a harmless caterpillar. Once duly elected, in office it will not just caper in front of the cameras (in fact, it will not talk at all to the legacy press)—it will spread its wings, and become a beautiful governing butterfly. Trump himself will not be the brain of this butterfly. He will not be the CEO. He will be the chairman of the board—he will select the CEO (an experienced executive). This process, which obviously has to be televised, will be complete by his inauguration—at which the transition to the next regime will start immediately . For Trump, being President will be exactly like it was—all the photo-ops and more—without any papers to sign, “decisions” to “make,” etc. The CEO he picks will run the executive branch without any interference from the Congress or courts, probably also taking over state and local governments. Most existing important institutions, public and private, will be shut down and replaced with new and efficient systems. Trump will be monitoring this CEO’s performance, again on TV, and can fire him if need be. But rebooting America is the easy part. The hard part is the path from egg to larva to imago. We can dream about the butterfly as much as we like, but it lives most of its life as an ugly brown grub. Let us now design this insect. Overview The strategy of the regime in internal exile is to legally construct an alternate regime. In a country that abstractly recognizes the principle of popular sovereignty, the people have the right to replace the current regime with this alternate regime, and can choose to do so in one step, at one time. The caterpillar can live as long as it likes; it will only become a butterfly once. Three principles must characterize the alternate regime: unity , excellence , and energy . These character traits will be seen in both the larva and the adult. The alternate regime must not be sectarian. In and out of power, it must appeal to all populations in the country. In a divided country, its policy is first and foremost one of national unity , and its first deliverable is peace in all civil wars —race wars, class wars, gender wars and culture wars—hot civil wars and cold civil wars—all over, forever. This is the most important thing you are voting for when you vote for the butterfly revolution: peace . No one steps on anyone’s toes and no one kicks anyone. In power, the new regime gives every population the right to live its own way of life by its own rules, inasmuch as this does not impose externalities on other populations, and also to transmit its folkways to the next generation without hindrance or penalty. Out of power, the new regime recruits every population into its institutions. The superiority of the alternate regime must be clear in every field in which its hand appears. Like the CPUSA in the 1930s, the alternate regime, as an unimportant grub, must work toward a presence in every important or prestigious field of endeavor. The networks and institutions it builds in this field must be suited to regulate it. They must feel the right, only because of their own excellence, to rule. As a butterfly, the new regime’s authority in every field will be inescapable. Since no field today is independent of power, old power can only be displaced by new power. If this new power has the local excellence to be a credible authority in the field, the field will transition to this new authority smoothly. If there is no superiority, fragments of the old regime, sustained by their own superiority, will remain and fester. The energy of the alternate regime must be unlimited. In power, it must be ready to reorganize all of public life—to change America as much as Atatürk changed Turkey. Out of power, it must be ready to capture as many offices as possible, and coordinate these offices as closely as possible. It seeks not only the maximum number of voters, but also the maximum engagement of these voters, and the maximum control over the maximum number of public offices. Its central power over these offices is complete. They belong not to their nominal occupants, but to the party that put them there. Any deviation from party discipline will unelect them at the next election. Maximizing these indicators will eventually allow it to take power with the maximum possible legitimacy. Every new regime is in the best shape if it begins by winning the power tournament of the old regime—if possible, at the deepest, most holy level. Then by definition the old regime then cannot compete with it on either playing field: the old one, or the new one. On taking power Any seizure of power must appeal to old and deep fundamental laws and principles, cutting through the Gordian knot of younger parchments—like Humphrey’s Executor , in which an anti-New Deal court was trying to snipe at FDR. It is possible to take a perverse interest in the political roots of this kind of case law. But it doesn’t matter. The true law of the land is that the President is the chief executive of the executive branch. This has a plain English meaning which has not changed in 250 years. Trump knows what it means to be a CEO. So do his voters and his staff. In office, they will behave as if the Constitution meant what it clearly says. Too bad about the haters! Congress may pass any bill it likes. The courts may have any opinion they like. It is the job of the executive branch, as a coequal branch of government, to respect these bills and opinions. But respecting the legislative and judicial branches is not the executive’s only job; nor does the Constitution say it is. If the voters feel that the President they elected has done a poor job, let them vote him out. He is accountable to them, and no one else. We call this “representative democracy.” If the institutions deny the President the Constitutional position he has legally won in the election, the voters will have to act directly. Trump will call his people into the streets—not at the end of his term, when he is most powerless; at the start , when he is most powerful. No one wants to see this nuclear option happen. Preparing for it and demonstrating the capacity to execute it will prevent it from having to happen. The task of the regime in exile is to give the voters the ability to send the message that they want a regime change, and have that message take effect. Anyone who does not believe the American voter has the right to elect a regime change does not believe in democracy. Anatomy of the larva Here is a tentative outline of the process and organization of a larval new regime. The anatomy of this caterpillar has three aspects: voters, politicians, and staffers.",12232

Curtis Yarvin and the rising right are crafting a different strain of conservative politics. By James Pogue April 20, 2022 Illustration by Brian Stauffer. Save this story Save Save this story Save It was Halloween in Orlando, and we had piled into a car to make a short trip from the Hilton to an after-party down the road, to wind up the first night of the latest edition of a gathering called the National Conservatism Conference. For at least many of the young people, the actual business of conference going seemed to be beside the point, a gesture at how we used to conduct politics back before life in America spun out of control. There were jokes, or maybe they were serious questions, about whether one of the guys tagging along with us was a fed. I surreptitiously made a few searches of the name he’d given me and was surprised when I couldn’t find a single plausible hit—though that could have been because he was a hyper-secret crypto type; there were some of those floating around. Not that anyone cared. These were people who were used to guarding their words. “Don’t fuck me here,” a dark-haired woman named Amanda Milius said to me—as she somewhat imperiously dealt with a guy at the door who was skeptical about letting a reporter into the party—“and say we’re all in here sacrificing kids to Moloch. We’re just the last normal people, hanging out at the end of the world.” I had met Milius outside the Hilton when I asked for a cigarette, and she began to chaperone me around, telling people who eyed my press pass that I was there to profile her as an up-and-coming female director who, she said, had attracted more Amazon streams than any woman ever with her first documentary, a counternarrative about Russiagate. “Annie Leibovitz is still scheduling the photo shoot,” she kept saying. In this world, almost every word is layered in so much irony that you can never be sure what to take seriously or not, perhaps a semiconscious defense mechanism for people convinced that almost everyone is out to get them. “Oh, fuck,” she said as we walked into a small ballroom where the party was already underway. The room was pitifully quiet, lit in strip-club red, and the sparse crowd was almost entirely male, with a cash bar off in the corner that seemed unable to produce drinks fast enough to buoy the mood. “We have a thing we say,” she said. “ ‘This is what the people at The Washington Post think we’re doing.’ Well, this is exactly what the people at The Washington Post think we’re doing.” A portly guy running for Congress in Georgia made his way to the front of the room to give a speech heavy on MAGA buzzwords and florid expressions of fealty to Donald Trump. “This is sad,” Milius said. No one cheered or even seemed interested. But this was not Trumpworld, even if many of the people in the room saw Trump as a useful tool. And these parties aren’t always so lame. NatCon, as this conference is known, has grown into a big-tent gathering for a whole range of people who want to push the American right in a more economically populist, culturally conservative, assertively nationalist direction. It draws everyone from Israel hawks to fusty paleocon professors to mainstream figures like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. But most of the media attention that the conference attracts focuses on a cohort of rosy young blazer-wearing activists and writers—a crop of people representing the American right’s “radical young intellectuals,” as a headline in The New Republic would soon put it, or conservatism’s “terrifying future,” as David Brooks called them in The Atlantic. But the people these pieces describe, who made up most of the partygoers around me, were only the most buttoned-up seam of a much larger and stranger political ferment, burbling up mainly within America’s young and well-educated elite, part of an intra-media class info-war. The podcasters, bro-ish anonymous Twitter posters, online philosophers, artists, and amorphous scenesters in this world are variously known as “dissidents,” “neo-reactionaries,” “post-leftists,” or the “heterodox” fringe—though they’re all often grouped for convenience under the heading of America’s New Right. They have a wildly diverse set of political backgrounds, with influences ranging from 17th-century Jacobite royalists to Marxist cultural critics to so-called reactionary feminists to the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, whom they sometimes refer to with semi-ironic affection as Uncle Ted. Which is to say that this New Right is not a part of the conservative movement as most people in America would understand it. It’s better described as a tangled set of frameworks for critiquing the systems of power and propaganda that most people reading this probably think of as “the way the world is.” And one point shapes all of it: It is a project to overthrow the thrust of progress, at least such as liberals understand the word. This worldview, these worldviews, run counter to the American narrative of the last century—that economic growth and technological innovation are inevitably leading us toward a better future. It’s a position that has become quietly edgy and cool in new tech outposts like Miami and Austin, and in downtown Manhattan, where New Right–ish politics are in, and signifiers like a demure cross necklace have become markers of a transgressive chic. No one is leading this movement, but it does have key figures. One is Peter Thiel, the billionaire who helped fund NatCon and who had just given the conference’s opening address. Thiel has also funded things like the edgelordy and post-left–inflected New People’s Cinema film festival, which ended its weeklong run of parties and screenings in Manhattan just a few days before NatCon began. He’s long been a big donor to Republican political candidates, but in recent years Thiel has grown increasingly involved in the politics of this younger and weirder world—becoming something like a nefarious godfather or a genial rich uncle, depending on your perspective. Podcasters and art-world figures now joke about their hope to get so-called Thielbucks. His most significant recent outlays have been to two young Senate candidates who are deeply enmeshed in this scene and influenced by its intellectual currents: Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance, running for the Republican nomination in Ohio, and Blake Masters in Arizona. Thiel has given more than $10 million to super PACs supporting the men’s candidacies, and both are personally close to him. Vance is a former employee of Thiel’s Mithril Capital, and Masters, until recently the COO of Thiel’s so-called “family office,” also ran the Thiel Foundation, which has become increasingly intertwined with this New Right ecosystem. These three—Thiel, Vance, Masters—are all friends with Curtis Yarvin, a 48-year-old ex-programmer and blogger who has done more than anyone to articulate the world historical critique and popularize the key terms of the New Right. You’ll often hear people in this world—again under many layers of irony—call him things like Lord Yarvin, or Our Prophet. I was looking around the party for Vance, who hadn’t arrived yet, when Milius nudged me and pointed to a table off to our left. “Why is it that whenever I see Curtis, he’s surrounded by a big table of incels?” she asked with apparent fondness. I spotted Yarvin, a slight, bespectacled man with long dark hair, drinking a glass of wine with a crowd that included Josh Hammer, the national conservatism–minded young opinion editor of Newsweek, and Michael Anton, a Machiavelli scholar and former spokesman for Trump’s National Security Council—and a prominent public intellectualizer of the Trump movement. Other luminaries afoot for the conference included Dignity author Chris Arnade, who seemed slightly unsure about the whole NatCon thing, and Sohrab Ahmari, the former opinion editor of the New York Post, now a cofounder and editor at the new magazine Compact, whose vision is, according to its mission statement, “shaped by our desire for a strong social-democratic state that defends community—local and national, familial and religious—against a libertine left and a libertarian right.” It is a very of-the-moment project. Political reporters, at least the ones who have bothered to write about Yarvin, have often dismissed him as a kook with a readership made up mostly of lonely internet weirdos, fascists, or both. But to ignore him is to underestimate how Yarvin’s ideas, or at least ideas in conversation with his, have become foundational to a whole political and cultural scene that goes much deeper than anything you’d learn from the panels and speeches at an event like NatCon. Or how those ideas are going to shape the future of the American right, whether or not Vance and Masters win their Senate primaries. I introduced myself, and soon Milius and I were outside smoking as Yarvin and I chatted about whether he’d be willing to talk to me on the record. People often struggle with what to make of Thiel’s involvement in this ecosystem. Last year the journalist Max Chafkin published a biography of Thiel, titled The Contrarian, in which he described Yarvin as the “house political philosopher” for a network often called the Thielverse. The book focuses heavily on Thiel’s political maneuverings, describing how he evolved from being a hyper-libertarian to someone who now makes common cause with nationalists and populists. And it explains how Thiel helped both Cruz and Josh Hawley on their paths to the Senate. The Contrarian ends with a dark picture of the billionaire trying to extend his political reach ever more overtly by funding and shepherding the campaigns of Masters and Vance. “Masters and Vance are different from Hawley and Cruz,” Chafkin writes; the former two are “extensions” of Thiel. This is only partly true. It would be just as accurate to say that Thiel has been influenced by the intellectual currents and political critiques of the New Right that he’s now helping to support. Many of these people are friendly with Thiel, or admire him, but are by no means beholden to him. And many of them hold views that would seem to make Thiel, a tech oligarch currently worth around $8 billion who recently resigned from the Meta—née Facebook—board of directors, their natural enemy. This New Right is heavily populated by people with graduate degrees, so there’s a lot of debate about who is in it and whether or not it even exists. At one end are the NatCons, post-liberals, and traditionalist figures like Benedict Option author Rod Dreher, who envision a conservatism reinvigorated by an embrace of localist values, religious identity, and an active role for the state in promoting everything from marriage to environmental conservation. But there’s also a highly online set of Substack writers, podcasters, and anonymous Twitter posters—“our true intellectual elite,” as one podcaster describes them. This group encompasses everyone from rich crypto bros and tech executives to back-to-the-landers to disaffected members of the American intellectual class, like Up in the Air author Walter Kirn, whose fulminations against groupthink and techno-authoritarianism have made him an unlikely champion to the dissident right and heterodox fringe. But they share a the basic worldview: that individualist liberal ideology, increasingly bureaucratic governments, and big tech are all combining into a world that is at once tyrannical, chaotic, and devoid of the systems of value and morality that give human life richness and meaning—as Blake Masters recently put it, a “dystopian hell-world.” Kirn didn’t want to put a label on this movement, describing it as a “fractious family of dissenters” when I called him at his home in Montana—“a somewhat new, loose coalition of people whose major concern is that we not end up in a top-down controlled state.” He told me he didn’t consider himself right wing and found some of the antidemocratic ideas he heard expressed in this sphere to be “personally chilling.” But he described it as a zone of experimentation and free expression of a kind that was now closed off in America’s liberal mainstream. “They seem to want a war,” he said. “The last thing I want is some kind of definitive ideological war which leaves out the heterodox, complicated, and almost naively open spirit of American politics.” “Most of the girls downtown ARE NORMAL, but they’ll wear a Trump hat as an accessory.” The ones deep into the online scene, she said, “want to be like LENI RIEFENSTAHL–EDIE SEDGWICK.” And the ferment is starting to get noticed. “I think that’s a really good sign,” one of the hosts of the dissident-right podcast The Fedpost said recently, discussing how Tucker Carlson had just quoted a tweet from one of their guests. “This is a kind of burgeoning sect of thought,” he went on, “and it’s causing people who are in positions of larger influence and relative power to actually have to start looking into it.” Vance sits somewhere in between these two tendencies—at 37, he’s a venture capitalist who is young enough to be exposed to the dissident online currents. But he’s also shaped by the most deeply traditionalist thinking of the American right. He is friends with Yarvin, whom he openly cites as a political influence, and with Dreher, who was there when Vance was baptized into the Catholic Church in 2019. I’d been writing about militias and right-wing stirrings in the rural West for years, but I didn’t really understand how this alchemy worked until I first met him last July. I’d gone back to Ohio to see my uncle, who was dying of cancer. Vance and I both grew up around Cincinnati, immersed in a culture of white rural migrants who had come from coalfields and farm towns to look for work in the cities of the Midwest. We had met as a kind of experiment—I was going to be in town anyway, and because my uncle was sick, I was thinking a lot about the place and what it meant to me. On a whim, I asked an editor at a conservative magazine if I could write something from the perspective of a skeptical leftist. Vance suggested that we meet at a diner where my dad had often taken me as a kid. He was barely registering in the polls at the time. Vance believes that a well-educated and culturally liberal American elite has greatly benefited from globalization, the financialization of our economy, and the growing power of big tech. This has led an Ivy League intellectual and management class—a quasi-aristocracy he calls “the regime”—to adopt a set of economic and cultural interests that directly oppose those of people in places like Middletown, Ohio, where he grew up. In the Vancian view, this class has no stake in what people on the New Right often call the “real economy”—the farm and factory jobs that once sustained middle-class life in Middle America. This is a fundamental difference between New Right figures like Vance and the Reaganite right-wingers of their parents’ generation. To Vance—and he’s said this—culture war is class warfare. Vance recently told an interviewer, “I gotta be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine,” a flick at the fact that he thinks the American-led global order is as much about enriching defense contractors and think-tank types as it is about defending America’s interests. “I do care about the fact that in my community right now the leading cause of death among 18- to 45-year-olds is Mexican fentanyl.” His criticisms of big tech as “enemies of Western civilization” often get lost in the run of Republican outrage over Trump being kicked off Twitter and Facebook, though they go much deeper than this. Vance believes that the regime has sold an illusive story that consumer gadgets and social media are constantly making our lives better, even as wages stagnate and technology feeds an epidemic of depression. I wrote a piece that came across as critical of him. It expressed my deep hopelessness about the future of America. I figured he’d want nothing more to do with me. But the morning it was published he sent me a short, heartfelt email. He said that he’d been a bit “pained” to read in the piece that my parents disliked him but said he’d like to talk more. “I don’t see you as a member of the elite because I see you as independent of their ideological strictures and incentives,” he wrote. “But maybe I’m just saying that because I like you.” “Despair,” he signed off, “serves the regime.” Part of why people have trouble describing this New Right is because it’s a bunch of people who believe that the system that organizes our society and government, which most of us think of as normal, is actually bizarre and insane. Which naturally makes them look bizarre and insane to people who think this system is normal. You’ll hear these people talk about our globalized consumerist society as “clown world.” You’ll often hear the worldview expressed by our media and intellectual class described as “the matrix” or the “Ministry of Truth,” as Thiel described it in his opening keynote speech to NatCon. It can be confusing to turn on something like the influential underground podcast Good Ol Boyz and hear a figure like Anton talk to two autodidact Southern gamers about the makeup of the regime, if only because most people reading this probably don’t think of America as the kind of place that has a regime at all. But that’s because, as many people in this world would argue, we’ve been so effectively propagandized that we can’t see how the system of power around us really works. This is not a conspiracy theory like QAnon, which presupposes that there are systems of power at work that normal people don’t see. This is an idea that the people who work in our systems of power are so obtuse that they can’t even see that they’re part of a conspiracy. “The fundamental premise of liberalism,” Yarvin told me, “is that there is this inexorable march toward progress. I disagree with that premise.” He believes that this premise underpins a massive framework of power. “My job,” as he puts it, “is to wake people up from the Truman Show.” We spoke sharing a bench outside in the dark one evening, a few days into the conference. Yarvin is friendly and solicitous in person, despite the fact that he tends to think and talk so fast that he can start unspooling, reworking baroque metaphors to explain ideas to listeners who have heard them many times before. Strange things can happen when you meet him. I’d gotten in touch with him through a mutual friend, a journalist I knew from New York who once had a big magazine assignment to write about him. The piece never came out. “They wanted him to say I was really evil and all that,” Yarvin told me. “He wouldn’t do it and pulled the piece. And I thought, Okay, that’s a cool guy.” This friend has now made a bunch of money in crypto, works on a project Yarvin helped launch to build a decentralized internet, and lives hours out into the desert in Utah, where he’ll occasionally call in to New Right–ish podcasts. He recently had dinner with Thiel and Masters—both Masters and Vance have raised money by offering donors a chance to dine with Thiel and the candidate. Yarvin has a pretty condescending view of the mainstream media: “They’re just predators,” he has said, who have to make a living attacking people like him. “They just need to eat.” He doesn’t usually deal with mainstream magazines and wrote that he’d been “ambushed” at the last NatCon, in 2019, by a reporter for Harper’s —where I also write—who made him out to be a bit of a loon and predicted that the NatCons’ populist program would soon be “stripped of its parts” by the corporate-minded Republican establishment. But the winds are shifting. He told me about how he’d gone to read poetry in New York recently, at the Thiel-funded NPC fest. “A bunch of lit kids showed up,” he said, grinning. I had grown into adulthood in the New York lit-kid world; even a few years ago, there was no question that anything like this could have happened. But now Yarvin is a cult hero to many in the ultrahip crowd that you’ll often hear referred to as the “downtown scene.” “I don’t even think antifa bothered showing up,” Yarvin said. “What would they do? It was an art party.” Yarvin had asked his new girlfriend, Lydia Laurenson, a 37-year-old founder of a progressive magazine, to vet me. The radical right turn her life had taken created complications. “One of my housemates was like—‘I don’t know if I want Curtis in our house,’ ” she told me. “And I’m like, ‘Okay, that makes sense. I understand why you’re saying that.’ ” Laurenson had been a well-known blogger and activist in the BDSM scene back when Yarvin was the central early figure in a world of “neo-reactionary” writers, publishing his poetry and political theory on the Blogger site under the name Mencius Moldbug. As Moldbug, Yarvin wrote about race-based IQ differences, and in an early post, titled “Why I Am Not a White Nationalist,” he defended reading and linking to white nationalist writing. He told me he’d pursued those early writings in a spirit of “open inquiry,” though Yarvin also openly acknowledged in the post that some of his readers seemed to be white nationalists. Some of Yarvin’s writing from then is so radically right wing that it almost has to be read to be believed, like the time he critiqued the attacks by the Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik—who killed 77 people, including dozens of children at a youth camp—not on the grounds that terrorism is wrong but because the killings wouldn’t do anything effective to overthrow what Yarvin called Norway’s “communist” government. He argued that Nelson Mandela, once head of the military wing of the African National Congress, had endorsed terror tactics and political murder against opponents, and said anyone who claimed “St. Mandela” was more innocent than Breivik might have “a mother you’d like to fuck.” He’s tempered himself in middle age—he now says he has a rule never to “say anything unnecessarily controversial, or go out of my way to be provocative for no reason.” Many liberals who hear him talk would probably question how strictly he follows this rule, but even in his Moldbug days, most of his controversial writings were couched in thickets of irony and metaphor, a mode of speech that younger podcasters and Twitter personalities on the highly online right have adopted—a way to avoid getting kicked off tech platforms or having their words quoted by liberal journalists. He considers himself a reactionary, not just a conservative—he thinks it is impossible for an Ivy League–educated person to really be a conservative. He has consistently argued that conservatives waste their time and political energy on fights over issues like gay marriage or critical race theory, because liberal ideology holds sway in the important institutions of prestige media and academia—an intertwined nexus he calls “the Cathedral.” He developed a theory to explain the fact that America has lost its so-called state capacity, his explanation for why it so often seems that it is not actually capable of governing anymore: The power of the executive branch has slowly devolved to an oligarchy of the educated who care more about competing for status within the system than they do about America’s national interest. One man raised his hand to ask how Masters planned to DRAIN THE SWAMP. He gave me a sly look. “Well, one of my friends has this acronym he calls RAGE,” he said. “Retire All Government Employees.” No one directs this system, and hardly anyone who participates in it believes that it’s a system at all. Someone like me who has made a career of writing about militias and extremist groups might go about my work thinking that all I do is try to tell important stories and honestly describe political upheaval. But within the Cathedral, the best way for me to get big assignments and win attention is to identify and attack what seem like threats against the established order, which includes nationalists, antigovernment types, or people who refuse to obey the opinions of the Cathedral’s experts on issues like vaccine mandates, in as alarming a way as I possibly can. This cycle becomes self-reinforcing and has been sent into hyperdrive by Twitter and Facebook, because the stuff that compels people to click on articles or share clips of a professor tends to affirm their worldview, or frighten them, or both at the same time. The more attention you gain in the Cathedral system, the more you can influence opinion and government policy. Journalists and academics and thinkers of any kind now live in a desperate race for attention—and in Yarvin’s view, this is all really a never-ending bid for influence, serving the interests of our oligarchical regime. So I may think I write for a living. But to Yarvin, what I actually do is more like a weird combination of intelligence-gathering and propagandizing. Which is why no one I was talking to at NatCon really thought it would be possible for me to write a fair piece about them. You won’t hear people use the Cathedral term a lot in public, although right-wing Twitter lit up with delight when Yarvin sketched the concept on Tucker Carlson’s Fox Nation show last September. People who’ve opened their eyes to this system of control have taken the red pill, a term Yarvin started using back in 2007, long before it got watered down to generally mean supporting Trump. To truly be red-pilled, you have to understand the workings of the Cathedral. And the way conservatives can actually win in America, he has argued, is for a Caesar-like figure to take power back from this devolved oligarchy and replace it with a monarchical regime run like a start-up. As early as 2012, he proposed the acronym RAGE—Retire All Government Employees—as a shorthand for a first step in the overthrow of the American “regime.” What we needed, Yarvin thought, was a “national CEO, [or] what’s called a dictator.” Yarvin now shies away from the word dictator and seems to be trying to promote a friendlier face of authoritarianism as the solution to our political warfare: “If you’re going to have a monarchy, it has to be a monarchy of everyone,” he said. By the time TechCrunch publicized Yarvin’s identity, in 2013, he had become influential in a small circle of the disaffected elite. In 2014, The Baffler published a lengthy look at his influence, titled “Mouthbreathing Machiavellis Dream of a Silicon Reich.” The piece warned that Yarvin’s ideas were spreading among prominent figures like Thiel and Balaji Srinivasan, formerly the CTO of Coinbase, and that it was possible for an intellectual fringe to “seize key positions of authority and power” and “eventually bring large numbers of people around,” just as the Koch brothers once had with their pro-business libertarianism, a position that Thiel was quickly moving away from. In 2017, BuzzFeed News published an email exchange between Yarvin and Milo Yiannopoulis in which Yarvin said that he’d watched the 2016 election returns with Thiel. “He’s fully enlightened,” Yarvin wrote. “Just plays it very carefully.” Masters soon had an office in Trump Tower. He and Thiel worked, generally without success, to install figures like Srinivasan, whom they proposed to head the FDA, and who himself often talked about the “paper belt,” in an echo of Yarvin’s Cathedral concept, and made common cause with figures like Steve Bannon, who wanted to pick apart the administrative state, an idea that at least had a hint of Yarvin’s RAGE proposal. Yarvin eventually stopped working as a programmer and left the Bay Area, moving with his wife and two children to Nevada. His wife died in April 2021, and he seems to have been devastated, publishing searching poems about her. But last September, a month before we spoke, he posted a dating call, inviting women who were “reasonably pretty and pretty smart,” as he put it, and “have read my work and like it,” and who thought that “the purpose of dating is to get married and have kids,” to email him so they could set up a Zoom date. “His writing doesn’t really represent who he is,” Laurenson told me. “So I answered this email and I was just like, ‘Hi, I’m a liberal, but I have a high IQ. And I want kids, and I’m actually just really curious to talk to you.’ ” The two are now engaged. Laurenson told me she’d had a gradual awakening that accelerated during the upheavals of the early pandemic and the protests of the summer of 2020. “I started really getting drawn to NRx ideas,” she said, using a common online abbreviation for the neo-reactionary fringe, “because I was tracking the riots,” by which she meant the violence that erupted amid some of the Black Lives Matter protests. “I have a background in social justice,” she said. But she was “horrified” by “how the mainstream media covered the riots.… It was just such a violation of all of my values.” She’d had a strange realization after she and Yarvin started dating, discovering that some of her friends had been reading him for years. “I found out that all these people had been reading NRx stuff just like me. They just never told anyone about it,” she said. “It has been very striking to me,” she said, “how cool this world is becoming.” Yarvin had given people a way to articulate a notion that somehow felt subversive to say out loud in America—that history was headed in the wrong direction. “Somebody said something earlier that captured it for me,” Laurenson said, just before they had to leave to go to a slightly hush-hush private dinner with Vance and a few others. “They said, ‘You can be here and know you’re not alone.’ ” People at the conference seemed excited about being in a place where they weren’t alone. I skipped most of the talks—which ranged from sessions about confronting the threat of China to the liberal influence on pop culture to “Worker Power.” Hawley gave a keynote on the “assault on the masculine virtues,” and Cruz offered up a traditional stump speech, evoking Reagan and saying he thought conservatives would soon prevail at the ballot box. “I’m pretty sure a lot of the 20-somethings rolled their eyes at that,” Yarvin said to me afterward with a smirk. The 20-somethings had a bigger vision. Up by the bar every night, hordes of young men, mostly, would descend to drink and bear-hug and spot favorite podcasters and writers. You could see Dave Rubin, and Jack Murphy, who hosts a popular New Right–ish YouTube channel and is trying to build a fraternal group of men who believe in “positive masculinity” that he calls the Liminal Order. Pretty much everyone had the same trimmed beard and haircut—sides buzzed short, the top longer and combed with a bit of gel to one side. I didn’t see a single Black person under the age of 50, though there were attendees of South Asian and Middle Eastern descent. In March, the journalist Jeff Sharlet (a Vanity Fair contributing editor who covers the American right) tweeted that the “intellectual New Right is a white supremacist project designed to cultivate non-white support,” and he linked it to resurgent nationalist and authoritarian politics around the world: “It’s part of a global fascist movement not limited to the anti-blackness of the U.S. &amp; Europe.” Yet many on the New Right seem increasingly unfazed by accusations that they’re white nationalists or racists. Masters in particular seems willing to goad commentators, believing that the ensuing arguments will redound to his political advantage: “Good luck [hitting] me with that,” Masters told the podcaster Alex Kaschuta recently, arguing that accusations of racism had become a political bludgeon used to keep conservative ideas outside the political mainstream. “Good luck criticizing me for saying critical race theory is anti-white.” But for all the chatter of looming dystopia, no one I spoke to raised one of the most dystopian aspects of American life: our vast apparatus of prisons and policing. Most people seemed more caught up in fighting what they perceived as the cant and groupthink among other members of the political media class, or the hypocrisy of rich white liberals who put up Black Lives Matter signs in front of multimillion-dollar homes, than they were with the raw experience that has given shape to America’s current racial politics. Milius was a sardonic and constant presence, easy to find smoking as Yarvin stood and talked at warp speed in his unmistakable voice. She was by far the most strikingly dressed person there, favoring Gucci and Ralph Lauren and lots of gold jewelry and big sunglasses. She is the daughter of the conservative director John Milius, who cowrote Apocalypse Now and directed Red Dawn. She grew up in Los Angeles, and it turned out that we’d both gone to the same tiny liberal arts college in Manhattan, so, like pretty much all the people there, she was used to living in social spaces where conservative views were considered strange if not downright evil. She thought something had radically changed since 2015, after she went to film school at USC and started working in Hollywood, before she suddenly dropped everything to work for Trump’s campaign in Nevada, eventually landing a job in his State Department. “What this is,” she said, “is a new thought movement. So it’s very hard to put your finger on and articulate what it is outside of Trumpism. Because it really is separate from the man himself, it has nothing to do with that.” She argued that the New Right, or whatever you wanted to call it, was, paradoxically, much less authoritarian than the ideology that now presented itself as mainstream. “I get the feeling, and I could be wrong,” she said, “that the right actually at this point is like almost in this live-and-let-live place where the left used to be at.” What she meant specifically: “The idea that you can’t raise your kids in a traditional, somewhat religious household without having them educated at school that their parents are Nazis.” This apparent laissez-faire obscures somewhat the intense focus that some people in this world have on trans issues—or what they might say is the media’s intense focus on trans issues, one of a suite of “mimetic viruses,” as Kaschuta, the podcaster, put it, that spread a highly individualistic liberal culture that is destructive to traditional ways of life. But the laissez-faire has helped win unlikely converts. Milius brought up Red Scare, a podcast that has become the premier example of this attraction—she’d actually cast one of the hosts, Dasha Nekrasova, in the film she made as her senior thesis in directing school at USC. The Red Scare hosts both started out as diffident socialists, back when it was still possible to think that socialism represented an edgy political stance, in the little interlocking spheres of America’s media and political set. One of them, Nekrasova, actually became known in media circles for a clip that went megaviral in 2018, when she cut dead a reporter for Alex Jones’s Infowars trying to ambush Bernie Sanders supporters at a festival in Austin. “I just want people to have health care, honey,” she deadpanned. “You people have, like, worms in your brains. Honestly.” Fast-forward to November 2021, and Nekrasova and her cohost Anna Khachiyan were posting photos of themselves with Jones’s arms wrapped around them under an evening Texas sun. Nekrasova now has a role on HBO’s Succession, playing a P.R. rep working with Kendall Roy; the show itself set “right-wing Twitter”—a sphere heavily populated by 20-somethings who work in tech or politics and seem to disproportionately live in D.C. and Miami—alight with delight when an episode in the latest season included a litany of key New Right phrases such as “integralist” and “Medicare for all, abortions for none.” The Red Scare hosts are only the best-known representatives of a fashionable dissident-y subculture, centered in but not exclusive to downtown Manhattan. “Everyone dresses like a duck hunter now,” a bewildered friend of mine texted recently. People use the derisive term “bugman” to describe liberal men who lack tangible life skills like fixing trucks or growing food—guys who could end up spending their lives behind the bug-eyed screen of a V.R. headset. Women wear clothes from Brandy Melville, which you can hear described ironically as fashionwear for girls with “fascist leanings,” and which named one of its lines after John Galt, the hero of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. People are converting to Catholicism. “It’s a good thing I have a girlfriend,” my friend texted. “Because casual sex is out.” Yarvin has mused that the liberal regime will begin to fall when the “cool kids” start to abandon its values and worldview. There are signs that this may be happening, though not all the so-called cool kids involved in this vibe shift would want to be colored as the vanguard in a world historical rebellion against the global order. “I’m not, like, into politics,” the writer Honor Levy, a Catholic convert and Bennington grad, told me when I called her. “I just want to have a family someday.” Levy, who was a leftist recently enough that she cried when it became clear that Bernie Sanders wouldn’t be the Democratic presidential nominee, is friendly with Yarvin and has had him on the podcast she cohosts, Wet Brain —“Yeah, the Cathedral and blah blah,” she said when we got to talking about political media. But she said she’d never even heard of J.D. Vance or Blake Masters. Levy is an It girl in a downtown Manhattan scene— The New Yorker has published her fiction; she is named in a New York Times story that tries to describe that scene—where right-wing politics have become an aesthetic pose that mingles strangely with an earnest search for moral grounding. “Until like a year and a half ago I didn’t believe good and evil existed,” she told me, later adding: “But I’m not in a state of grace, I shouldn’t be talking.” I asked if she would take money from Thiel and she cheerily said, “Of course!” She also described her cohort as a bunch of “libertines,” and on her podcast you can get a window into a world of people who enjoy a mind-bendingly ironic thrill by tut-tutting each other for missing church or having premarital sex. “Most of the girls downtown are normal, but they’ll wear a Trump hat as an accessory,” she said. The ones deep into the online scene, she said, “want to be like Leni Riefenstahl–Edie Sedgwick.” Like Levy, Milius is in the funny position of being at the intersection of many of these crosscurrents, having worked in mainstream politics but appearing on so-called dissident podcasts and being on the periphery of a cultural scene where right-wing politics have taken on a sheen approximating cool. She said she was too “black-pilled”—a very online term used to describe people who think that our world is so messed up that nothing can save it now—to think much about what it would look like for her side to win. “I could fucking trip over the curb,” Milius said, “and that’s going to be considered white supremacism. Like, there’s nothing you can do. What the fuck isn’t white supremacism?” “They’re going to come for everything,” she said. “And I think it’s sinister—not that I think that people who want to pay attention to race issues are sinister. But I think that the globalization movement is using these divisive arguments in order to make people think that it’s a good thing.” This is the Cathedral at work. A few weeks after NatCon, I drove from California to Tucson to meet Masters, a very tall, very thin, very fit 35-year-old. I wanted to see how all this might translate into an actual election campaign, and I’d been watching a lot of Fox News, including Yarvin’s streaming interview with Carlson in which he gave a swirling depiction of how the Cathedral produced its groupthink. “Why do Yale and Harvard always agree on everything?” he asked. “These organizations are essentially branches of the same thing,” he told a mesmerized Carlson. “You’re like, ‘Where are the wires?’ ” He sketched his vision of (as he calls it) a “constitutional” regime change that would take power back from this oligarchy—so diffuse most people hardly knew it was there. “That’s what makes it so hard to kill,” he said. At a coffee shop near the house he’d bought when he moved back home to Tucson from the Bay Area, Masters and I went through the tenets of his nationalist platform: on-shoring industrial production, slashing legal immigration, regulating big tech companies, and eventually restructuring the economy so that one salary would be enough to raise a family on. I mentioned Yarvin and his line of arguing that America’s system had become so sclerotic that it was hopeless to imagine making big systemic changes like these. “In a system where state capacity is very low…” I started the question. “Alas,” he said, with a twinkle in his eye. “Do we need a crisis to get there?” I asked him. “Maybe, maybe, maybe,” he said. It wasn’t where his immediate thinking was. “I’ll have the proverbial machete,” he said. “But yeah, it may take some kind of crisis to get us there.” He paused. “But we’re already sort of in one, right?” Masters often says he’s not as black-pilled and pessimistic as some in the New Right spheres. He seems, unlike many New Righters, to still earnestly believe in the power of electoral politics. But he does think that the culturally liberal and free-market ideology that has guided America’s politics in recent years is a hopeless dead end. “A country is not just an economy,” Masters told the dissident-right outlet IM—1776 recently. “You also need a conception of yourself as a nation, as a people, and as a culture. And that’s what America is increasingly lacking today.” “It’s true that I’m incredibly hopeful,” he said to me. “I think it’s really bleak, I think the default is continued stagnation, and maybe you get the crisis in 5 years or maybe it’s 30 years from now.” He told me that he didn’t like to use terms like the Cathedral and used “the regime” less often than Vance, although I later noticed that he used this latter phrase frequently with interviewers on the dissident right. “ ‘The regime’ sounds really sexy, right?” he said to me. “It’s a tangible enemy—if you could just grapple with it in the right way, you can topple it. And I think it’s actually just a lot less sexy and a lot more bureaucratic,” he said. “But I’ve read that stuff, and I see what it means.” I asked him about the term Thielbucks, and how true it was that the Thiel Foundation was funding a network of New Right podcasters and cool-kid cultural figures as a sort of cultural vanguard. “It depends if it’s just dissident-right think-tank stuff,” he told me, “or if anyone actually does anything.” “I don’t know how that became a meme,” he said about Thielbucks. “I think I would know if those kids were getting money.” “We fund some stuff,” he told me. “But we’re not funding an army of meme posters.” He told me that he and Thiel had met with Khachiyan, one of the cohosts of Red Scare. “Which was cool,” he said. “Their podcast is interesting.” I asked if there was a world in which they might get funding from Thiel. “Maybe, yeah,” he said. “We fund some weird stuff with the Thiel Foundation.” We drove together to a campaign event, talking about everything from how technology is reshaping our brains to environmental policy, both of us circling from different political directions to an apocalyptic place. “I do think we’re at a moment of crossroads,” he said. “And if we play it wrong, it’s the Dark Ages.” Masters has publicly said he thinks “everybody should read” the Unabomber’s anti-tech manifesto, “Industrial Society and Its Future,” which may sound strange for a young tech executive running to serve in the United States Senate. But to Masters, Kaczynski’s critique was a useful analysis of how technology shapes our world and how “degrading and debasing” it could be to human lives. I asked whether he thought the core of his project was a fight against a consumerist techno-dystopia that many on the left have also come to fear. He said yes. I asked why, if this was the case, it almost never came across in his mainstream media appearances. “That’s interesting feedback,” he said. “That it’s not coming through.” “I go on, and it’s the tail end of the B block, and I’ve got two minutes to talk about Kyle Rittenhouse,” he’d said earlier, talking about his spots on Fox News. “And it’s like, ‘Well, the left is insane, and this kid shouldn’t have been on trial, and they’re punishing him for being a white guy who defended himself with an AR-15.’ ” Conservative media seems to thrive on culture-war touch points as much as all the rest of it. “I feel like I’m willing to go there,” he said. “But you can’t do that on Laura Ingraham sound bites.” He was a little less rosy about the future with some interviewers than he was with me. “We need someone with their hand on the tiller who understands where we’ve been and where we need to go,” he told the podcaster Alex Kaschuta recently. “Otherwise we will get just totally owned by the progressive left. And the progressive left just remains the enemy. It’s the enemy of true progress. It’s the enemy of everything that is good.” I asked if he could give me a vision of what he thought victory for his side would look like. “It’s just families and meaningful work,” he said, “so that you can raise your kids and worship and pursue your hobbies and figure out what the meaning of it all is.” Pretty much anyone could agree with this. And pretty much anyone could wonder how it is that this sort of thing has come to seem radical, or distant from the lives of many people growing into adulthood today. “It just feels so networked,” he said. “It’s so in-the-matrix.” We drove a long way into the desert before we arrived at the campaign meet-and-greet, which was being hosted by a former CIA official in a comfortable retirement community. The crowd of a few dozen was mostly sweater-wearing retirees, immersed in a media culture in which the people who repeated the most incendiary and Trumpist talking points tended to gain attention and political support. This kind of groupthink was not just a phenomenon of the liberal media, and this fact has hampered the campaigns of both Masters and Vance, who are often seen as Trump-aligned culture warriors, and who have had a lot of trouble working their more complicated policy ideas into our fervid political conversation. He talked through his proposal to regulate tech companies as common carriers, like America once regulated phone companies. The crowd seemed interested but hardly electrified. When he took questions at the end, they were mostly the usual ones about the supposedly stolen 2020 election—a view that Masters did not push back on—the border wall, vaccine mandates. One man raised his hand to ask how Masters planned to drain the swamp. He gave me a sly look. “Well, one of my friends has this acronym he calls RAGE,” he said. “Retire All Government Employees.” The crowd liked the sound of this and erupted in a cheer. On the last afternoon of NatCon, a few hours before he was set to give the keynote address, Vance showed up. He spotted me drinking a beer at the bar and came over to say hello. “I still have no idea what I’m going to say,” he said, though he didn’t seem worried. I wandered down to the ballroom to wait and ended up sitting with the U.S. correspondent for the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel. I knew that some of the reporters there might have been under the impression that this was all mostly just tweedy MAGA pageantry. He had a more complex view, having just spoken to Yarvin, and asked me to explain his philosophy. I found myself at a loss. I said that there were these things called the regime and the Cathedral and that Yarvin was “sort of a monarchist.” “A monarchist ?”he asked. He seemed taken aback to learn that what this hero figure of the New Right dreamed of was a king. Vance showed up, wearing a suit and bright red tie, looking relaxed for a person who was about to give a speech to hundreds of people who viewed him as possibly a last great hope in saving the American nation from global corporatist subjugation. He’d shot up in the polls and at that moment was second in his primary, helped by regular invitations from Carlson. I asked how he was feeling about the speech. He looked impish. “I think I’ve got a good topic,” he said. “I’m going to talk about college.” What he meant was that he was about to give a genuinely thunderous speech, titled “The Universities Are the Enemy.” People immediately pointed out that it was a variation on something that Richard Nixon said to Henry Kissinger on White House tapes back in 1972. Vance denounced elite colleges as enemies of the American people; he has long proposed cutting off their federal funding and seizing their endowments. The speech was later linked in alarmed op-eds to “anti-intellectual” movements that had attacked institutions of learning. But that doesn’t quite reckon with what an apocalyptic message he was offering. Because Vance and this New Right cohort, who are mostly so, so highly educated and well-read that their big problem often seems to be that they’re just too nerdy to be an effective force in mass politics, are not anti-intellectual. Vance is an intellectual himself, even if he’s not currently playing one on TV. But he thinks that our universities are full of people who have a structural, self-serving, and financial interest in colo",50000

Groypers A downloadable version of this page can be accessed here . The Groyper movement is a loose network of white nationalist activists and internet trolls who gravitate around several key online influencers. Their goal is to push and normalize white nationalist ideas within mainstream conservatism. Who are the Groypers? Self-named after the ‘Groyper’ toad image, which became popular as an explicitly racist-coded variation of the Pepe the Frog meme often affiliated with the &#8216;alt-right&#8217;, the Groypers emerged offline as a movement in 2019 and followed the decline of the alt-right. Initially followers of the &#8216;America First&#8217; podcast host Nick Fuentes, they describe themselves as &#8216; American nationalists &#8216; and hold similar beliefs to the alt-right. Groypers represent a new momentum within American white nationalism. They have a particular focus on capturing members of Generation Z, and in portraying themselves as American Christian nationalists, hope to attract disaffected conservatives by exploiting schisms and grievances within mainstream conservatism. The ‘Groyper’ toad image. What are their beliefs? Groypers &#8211; also known as the ‘Groyper Army’ &#8211; are opposed to liberal values, feminism, LQBTQ+ rights and progressive ideology, believing that shifting racial and cultural demographics present an existential threat to white European-American identity and culture. In a bid to disassociate themselves with the failures of the altright, Groypers have attempted to align themselves and their beliefs with Christianity and traditional ‘Christian’ values. Groypers are fixated on immigration and want the US to close its borders to prevent the further influx of those they believe are likely to boost the Democratic vote. Groypers regard the broader mainstream conservative movement as weak and unwilling to confront such changes, and refer to it as ‘Conservative Inc.’. By ignoring topics such as demographics and traditional family values (i.e. which they perceive as acceptance of LGBTQ+ persons) Groypers believe mainstream conservatives have sold out to the left on the culture war front and therefore need to be dragged back to the right. Key Figures Nick Fuentes A holocaust denier and former YouTuber, Nick Fuentes is the host of the &#8216;America First&#8217; podcast and considered to be the leader of the Groypers. Fuentes first rose to prominence when he left Boston University after he reported receiving threats in response to his attendance at the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right Rally. He went on to establish the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC) , a rival to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Patrick Casey Patrick Casey is the former leader of the American Identity Movement (formerly Identity Evropa), a white supremacist organization disbanded in November 2020. In February 2021 Casey split from the Groyper movement over the fear of federal informant infiltration. Michelle Malkin Michelle Malkin is a conservative political commentator and self-described “ mommy ” of the Groypers. The former Fox contributor, who joined Newsmax TV in May 2021, has spoken at America First events. Jacob Lloyd Jacob Lloyd is a former YouTuber and Infowars contributor. He spoke at the Groyper Leadership Summit in 2019 and claims to have had a leading role in formulating the questions asked by Groypers at conservative events. Baked Alaska Real name Anthime Gionet , Baked Alaska is a neo-Nazi live streamer and Groyper follower who was arrested for his role in storming the US Capitol building on January 6 2021. During the riot, he wore Pit Viper sunglasses, which have since been adopted as a symbol by the Groypers. Jaden McNeil Jaden McNeil is the former President of the Kansas State University chapter of Turning Point USA (TPUSA). McNeil left TPUSA because of their “ culture of censorship ” and founded Groyper rival organization America First Students. Vincent James Vincent James is a former YouTuber with the second-highest following of the Groypers on Telegram after Fuentes, with over 41,400 users following his channel. He has also spoken at AFPAC events. Tactics Ironic Trolling One clear line from the alt-right to the Groypers is their use of irony to hide and when necessary deny their white nationalist viewpoints. The best evidence of this poisoned irony is the Groyper’s toad emblem. The smug, unfit and cartoonish character of the Groyper makes Fuentes’ white nationalism seem transgressive and silly, which in turn increases its appeal. Groyper Wars During a series of campus speaking engagements in 2019, Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder and leader Charlie Kirk, as well as his guests which included Donald Trump Jr. and Rep. Dan Crenshaw found themselves being heckled and asked uncomfortable, trollish questions by Groypers who had coordinated to pack the lines at the TPUSA event. Groypers would ask speakers loaded questions in an attempt to shine a light on Conservative, Inc.’s supposed hypocrisy, while also adding the Groyper notoriety and providing it with material to use in memes and propaganda. Topics included immigration, homosexuality and the US relationship with Israel, often referencing antisemitic dogwhistles such as questions about the USS Liberty incident or the “ dancing Israelis” conspiracy theory. Alternative Conservative Conferences The Groypers have made a point of repeatedly showing up at major Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) events – despite being banned – and organizing their own nearby alternatives. In July 2021, Fuentes crashed CPAC in Texas alongside a number of followers chanting “America First” and “White Boy Summer”. The group was filmed harassing a reporter before being removed. Fuentes and a number of Groypers had also attempted to gain entry during the Florida CPAC that February. The gatecrashing of CPAC events is a tactic deployed by the Groypers to increase visibility and gain supporters from those attending mainstream conservative events. Campus Organizing College campuses have been a battleground for the far-right since early in the alt-right’s ascendancy . Despite the alt-right’s fracturing, college campuses remain targeted by the far-right. According to the ADL 2019 saw a doubling of white nationalist propaganda on campuses. Drawing on this success, one Groyper, Jaden McNeil, started his own student group at Kansas University called American First Students. Groyper activity online Fuentes has been removed from Twitter , YouTube, Twitch, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Discord, Clubhouse, Spotify, PayPal, Venmo, Airbnb, Shopify, Amazon Web Services, Stripe, Streamlabs, Apple Podcasts and Coinbase. Followers of the Groyper movement are still extremely active on Twitter, where they often tweet antisemitic and racist content and can be identified by their use of Groyper display pictures. Several Groyper influencers have migrated to other platforms like Gab or Telegram. For example, Fuentes has over 125,000 followers on Gab and over 41,900 subscribers on Telegram. Supporters can also donate to America First or Fuentes on their official websites by buying branded merchandise. In October 2021, the Groypers launched their own streaming service ‘cozy.tv’, where followers can watch shows by Fuentes, Vincent James and Jaden McNeil. Violence &amp; Real-world Incidents In January 2020 Samuel Gulick, an 18-year-old who frequently posted content shared by members of the Groyper and America First movements, was arrested and charged by federal authorities for carrying out an arson attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Delaware. Although Fuentes has stressed the need for the Groypers to separate themselves from white nationalists who use violent rhetoric, two days before the Capitol Hill riot he raised the issue of killing state lawmakers, before quickly backtracking his comments on his America First show. Fuentes later attended the January 6th protests, and although he did not enter the Capitol he described the riot as “awesome”. Supporters with America First merchandise were seen both at the rally and inside the building. January 6th &#8216;Stop the Steal&#8217; organiser Ali Alexander collaborated with Fuentes in the run-up to the rally, seeing his ability to mobilise the Groypers as an asset. The neo-Nazi and Groyper follower ‘Baked Alaska’ live-streamed his attendance at the rally, and was later arrested and charged for breaching the Capitol building. Key Takeaways The Groyper movement does not represent a new thematic approach by the far-right. Rather, it is a continuation of some of the key themes commonly seen throughout the far-right’s history in the United States. Namely, these are that America will soon be overrun by immigrants and other &#8216;lesser&#8217; cultures, that traditional family values are dying out and that right-wing pundits and politicians have, by and large, sold America out. The only solution is for &#8216;true conservatives&#8217; to reclaim the system from the inside. What distinguishes the Groypers is their tech savviness and natural comfort with using the web as a means to recruit and distribute memes and propaganda. While it is undoubtedly a positive thing that Fuentes, Casey and co. have been repeatedly de-platformed their willingness to use any and all sites to distribute their message, coupled with their transgressive approach, means that they represent a potent challenge. Identifiable symbols Pit Viper sunglasses Pit Viper sunglasses were first associated with the Groypers on 6 January 2021, when Baked Alaska (see Key Figures) wore them during the US Capitol riot, which he livestreamed on Twitch. In July 2021, Nick Fuentes and others wore Pit Viper shades when they crashed a CPAC event in Dallas. Groyper meme Groypers derive their name from the ‘Groyper’ toad image, which became popular in 2017 as an explicitly racist-coded variation of the Pepe the Frog meme often affiliated with the alt-right. America First logo ‘America First’ is the name of Nick Fuentes’ pod-cast. In 2020, Fuentes founded the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC).

But Yarvin, the dean of the so-called neoreactionary movement among the Silicon Valley Neteratti, is having another breakout moment, as the restive, grievance-fueled American right careens toward the 2022 midterms. Over at Vox , Andrew Prokop has published an extensive interview with and intellectual profile of Yarvin, who has long and loudly argued that democracy is an outmoded conceit that the American system is well rid of. The next phase of political evolution, he contended in his now-dormant blog Unqualified Reservations and in sporadic commentary since, involves a grateful embrace of dictatorship and/or monarchy, so that the real forces running the world can get the job done without all the pointless and messy shadow play of mass consensus. Yarvin’s present claim to fame is that GOP Senate hopefuls Blake Masters in Arizona and J.D. Vance in Ohio have both favorably cited a key plank of his plan for post-democratic overhaul—the strongman plan to “retire all government employees,” which goes by the jaunty mnemonic “RAGE.” As Yarvin envisions it, RAGE is the great purge of the old operating system that clears the path for a more enlightened race of technocrats to seize power and launch the social order on its rational course toward information-driven self-realization. Collateral casualties in this “reboot” will be the nexus of pusillanimous yet all-powerful institutions Yarvin has dubbed “the Cathedral”—the universities, the elite media, and anything else that’s fallen prey to liberal perfidy as the heroic apostles of hard-right digital truth-telling have come wearily to know it. Yarvin hastens to add, amid his reactionary reveries, that this is not an old blood-and-soil brand of ethnic or racialized fascism—though Yarvin, like many Silicon Valley acolytes of the far right, has left an ugly trail of race-baiting trollery in his wake. Corey Pein documented this strain of Yarvin’s thought in one of the earliest exposés of the neoreactionary movement , which I was proud to help publish in my former capacity as an editor at The Baffler : “I am not a white nationalist, but I do read white-nationalist blogs, and I’m not afraid to link to them…I am not exactly allergic to the stuff,” Yarvin writes. He also praises a blogger who advocated the deportation of Muslims and the closure of mosques as “probably the most imaginative and interesting right-wing writer on the planet.” Hectoring a Swarthmore history professor, Yarvin rhapsodizes on colonial rule in Southern Africa, and suggests that black people had it better under apartheid. “If you ask me to condemn [mass murderer] Anders Breivik, but adore Nelson Mandela, perhaps you have a mother you’d like to fuck,” Yarvin writes. His jargon may be novel, but whenever Mencius Moldbug descends to the realm of the concrete, he offers familiar tropes of white victimhood. Yarvin’s favorite author, the nineteenth-century writer Scot Thomas Carlyle, is perhaps best known for his infamous slavery apologia, “Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question.” “If there is one writer in English whose name can be uttered with Shakespeare’s, it is Carlyle,” Yarvin writes. Later in the same essay Yarvin calls slavery “a natural human relationship” akin to “that of patron and client.” Popular ""swipe left below to view more authors"" Swipe → Elon Musk’s Vision Is Coming Into Focus—and It Looks a Lot Like Neo-Apartheid Elon Musk’s Vision Is Coming Into Focus—and It Looks a Lot Like Neo-Apartheid Elie Mystal It’s Time for the Democrats to Throw Off the Dead Hand of Clintonism It’s Time for the Democrats to Throw Off the Dead Hand of Clintonism Feature / Lily Geismer Donald Trump Is Stealing the Kennedy Brand Donald Trump Is Stealing the Kennedy Brand Jeet Heer How Amazon Is Taking Its Union-Busting to New Heights How Amazon Is Taking Its Union-Busting to New Heights Ella Fanger Popular ""swipe left below to view more authors"" Swipe → Elon Musk’s Vision Is Coming Into Focus—and It Looks a Lot Like Neo-Apartheid Elon Musk’s Vision Is Coming Into Focus—and It Looks a Lot Like Neo-Apartheid Elie Mystal It’s Time for the Democrats to Throw Off the Dead Hand of Clintonism It’s Time for the Democrats to Throw Off the Dead Hand of Clintonism Feature / Lily Geismer Donald Trump Is Stealing the Kennedy Brand Donald Trump Is Stealing the Kennedy Brand Jeet Heer How Amazon Is Taking Its Union-Busting to New Heights How Amazon Is Taking Its Union-Busting to New Heights Ella Fanger Prokop revisits the racist strain of Yarvin’s blogging past in a brief paragraph, citing Yarvin’s belief in “biological roots of intelligence” that play a role in creating alleged disparities in intelligence among different groups. He also includes a disclaimer from Yarvin claiming that racism is “despicable” and that Europeans have no innate “moral superiority” over rival ethnic or racial groups. This all adds up, naturally, to classic both-sidesing of race hate; a case for the “biological roots of intelligence” cannot be placed alongside a denunciation of racism in a way that makes the latter remotely coherent. This is the supine journalistic posture that the alt right has long exploited to its own advantage. (For good measure, Prokop repeats the one-paragraph-of-controversy treatment in discussing Yarvin’s plainly fascist outlook; that discussion, too, resolves in an arcane and unconvincing Yarvin alibi—he’s a monarchist, not a fascist!—that effectively crowds out all substantive engagement with the question.) The alt-white character of Yarvinism apparently can now be readily dispensed with, since the American right is already primed, in its post-January 6 incarnation, to endorse all the other major elements of Yarvin’s program. The litany is by now familiar: Congress is reviled; the court system is sclerotic; federal bureaucracies are frustratingly outmoded and buggy. So bring on the enlightened (or variably enlightened) despot! “You’re not that far from a world in which you can have a candidate” aligned with such a program, Yarvin coyly tells Prokop. “I think you can get away with it. That’s sort of what people already thought was happening with Trump. To do it for real is not going to make them much more hysterical, and”—here Prokop records “he laughed”—”it’s actually much more effective!” Current Issue View our current issue Y arvin’s fascist enthusiasms have migrated into the mainstream right thanks largely to the support of billionaire PayPal cofounder and original Facebook backer Peter Thiel, another 1990s-bred pseudo-intellectual of the Valley right, who famously announced in his own burst of Yarvinite glee in 2009 that “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” Thiel has been as good as his word, bankrolling secessionist projects on the right like the Seasteading Institute while also funding Yarvin’s own start-up, Tlon. Thiel also generously donates to hard-right political candidates; at the height of his on-again, off-again infatuation with Trump, he landed a speaking spot at the 2016 GOP national convention. Via his PAC, Thiel has racked up $15 million in donations to each of the Masters and Vance campaigns in this year’s primary cycle alone, but their subsequent campaign woes have prompted the wan Bloomberg News headline “ Thiel-Backed Candidates Struggle to Connect with Donors Not Named Peter Thiel .” That grim observation suggests that, even within the moneyed system of US campaigning, the Yarvin plan is more a product of the hothouse delusions of Silicon Valley moguldom than any organic groundswell of support. But that may be a distinction without a difference in a political system that coughed up the unlikely specter of Donald Trump, tribune of the common voter. The chief selling point of Yarvinsim for the Trump faithful, Pein points out, is a shared political demonology—even though the right-wing brief against feckless liberal institutional rule comes across as something of a period piece in an age of open election-denying and coup-plotting on the right. “It boggles my mind that people think there’s something profound to this concept of ‘the Cathedral,’ when it’s clearly just an abbreviated enemies list inspired by personal aggrievement and a fascist agenda,” Pein told The Nation . “If the universities, the news media, and even the federal bureaucracy are so all-powerful, why are those institutions even debating whether Trump should be charged in relation to his January 6 coup attempt? It’s not the strength but the weakness of those institutions, and the dominance of capital, that has gotten us to where we are.” This latter point, more than any other, highlights the true nature of the neoreactionary threat. “As a writer, I find it depressing that one rich man’s favor can elevate pseudo-intellectual fascist dreck to this exalted status,” Pein says. “What’s worse is that Thiel’s money has put us all in the position of needing to defend fundamental values such as the right of people to select their own leaders through a fair and transparent process, and equality under the law. This twisted anti-democracy ideology is as much a product of Silicon Valley as any app or gadget. The elevation of Yarvin to Republican luminary is an argument for confiscating and redistributing the wealth of all billionaires.” Submit a correction Send a letter to the editor Reprints &amp; permissions Chris Lehmann Chris Lehmann is the DC Bureau chief for The Nation and a contributing editor at The Baffler.

Trump acknowledged having dinner with West, who legally changed his name to Ye, on Tuesday night at Mar-a-Lago and said he brought along friends, one of whom was Nick Fuentes, an outspoken anti-Semite and racist.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates condemned Trump’s meeting with Fuentes. “Bigotry, hate, and anti-Semitism have absolutely no place in America – including at Mar-a-Lago. Holocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous, and it must be forcefully condemned,” Bates told CNN on Saturday. President Joe Biden, who is spending the holiday weekend in Nantucket, dodged a question about Trump’s dinner by saying: “You don’t wanna hear what I think.” Fuentes is a Holocaust denier whose YouTube channel was permanently suspended in early 2020 for violating the platform’s hate speech policy. Trump announced his plans in mid-November to seek reelection in 2024, and his embrace of a white nationalist unsettled some of his onetime administration officials. David Friedman, who was Trump’s former ambassador to Israel, blasted the dinner at Mar-a-Lago. “Even a social visit from an anti-Semite like Kanye West and human scum like Nick Fuentes is unacceptable,” Friedman said in one of several tweets. “Anti-Semites deserve no quarter among American leaders, right or left,” he said. Advertisement Axios, a news website, cited what it said was a source familiar with the dinner as saying Trump “seemed very taken” with Fuentes, even though he didn’t seem to know anything about his background.

Photograph: Nicole Hester/AP Donald Trump This article is more than 2 years old Donald Trump ‘shied away from criticising Nick Fuentes’ This article is more than 2 years old Advisers wanted ex-president to distance himself from white supremacist with whom he dined but Trump feared alienating supporters – insiders Hugo Lowell in Washington Mon 28 Nov 2022 16.53 EST First published on Mon 28 Nov 2022 02.00 EST Share Donald Trump repeatedly refused to disavow the outspoken antisemite and white supremacist Nick Fuentes after they spoke over dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort, rejecting the advice from advisers over fears he might alienate a section of his base, two people familiar with the situation said. The former US president was urged publicly and privately to denounce Fuentes in the aftermath of the dinner , which included the performer Ye, previously known as Kanye West, who has also recently been propagating antisemitic remarks. But Trump eschewed making outright disavowals of Fuentes, the people said, and none of the statements from the campaign or on his Truth Social account included criticism of Fuentes, despite efforts from advisers who reached Trump over the Thanksgiving holiday. Republican says Trump ‘empowering’ extremists by having dinner with white supremacist Read more Trump ultimately made clear that he fundamentally did not want to criticise Fuentes – a product of his dislike of confrontation and his anxiety that it might antagonise a devoted part of his base – and became more entrenched in his obstinance the more he was urged to do so. Across three statements on Friday, Trump initially sought only to play down the dinner and made no mention of Fuentes or his views, before saying angrily in a post on his Truth Social website that evening that Ye “expressed no antisemitism” and “I didn’t know Nick Fuentes”. The line about not knowing Fuentes was the closest Trump came to acknowledging the offensive nature of the dinner, under pressure from advisers who warned him that being associated with a racist and Holocaust denier could further damage his personal brand as well as his recently launched 2024 presidential campaign. But even with his ignorance of Fuentes taken at face value, the statements signal Trump will give extraordinary deference to the most fringe elements of his base – even if it means potentially losing support from more moderate Republicans who have not typically cared for his indulgence of extremism. Trump has had a long history of delaying or muting criticism of white supremacy, drawing moral equivalency in 2017 between neo-Nazis and counter-protesters at the deadly unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia , and refusing to denounce the far-right Proud Boys group at a 2020 presidential debate. The halting response to Fuentes most closely mirrored his inability to condemn white supremacist groups after Charlottesville, the people said, when Trump faced intense criticism for not naming the rightwing groups in the bloodshed that ended with the death of a young woman. When reached for comment, the Trump 2024 campaign said the former president had a record of combating antisemitism, including the appointment of a special envoy to combat antisemitism, and strengthening ties to Israel by recognising Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights. The circumstances of the dinner at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, though, have been a new source of consternation for aides, who privately concede that Ye should never have been allowed to meet with Trump in the first place given his own recent antisemitic history. Trump had intended to meet with Ye one-on-one for some time, according to a person briefed on the matter, though it was postponed around the time that Ye tweeted offensive tropes against Jews – only for it to be inexplicably rescheduled for late November. The former president ended up meeting with Fuentes, who was at the unrest in Charlottesville, after he came along with Ye and a former Trump campaign aide, Karen Giorno. There was only a skeleton staff from Trump’s “45 Office” at the property ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. During the dinner, the person said, Fuentes told Trump he was among the former president’s supporters, but that he had been unimpressed with the 2024 campaign launch speech because it appeared stilted instead of appearing “authentic” with his ad-libs and off-the-cuff remarks. Trump, who had told Fuentes that his advisers preferred him to read speeches as scripted, turned to Ye at one point and said: “He gets me.” Fuentes also told Trump that he thought the former president would crush other 2024 candidates in a primary, including the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, the person said – though Fuentes later appeared less than enthusiastic on his live stream , saying the future of the country “isn’t Donald Trump”. On Saturday, US president Joe Biden said “you don’t want to know what I think” when asked about Trump’s guests. On Sunday, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates issued a statement, saying: “Bigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America – including at Mar-A-Lago. Holocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous, and it must be forcefully condemned.” And during the White House media briefing on Monday afternoon, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: “This administration, this president totally rejects bigotry, racism, antisemitism and there is just no places for these types of vile forces in our society … We should all be condemning this.” She added: “When you say things like this, when you do not speak out against these kinds of poisonous and dangerous kind of remarks … that is also incredibly dangerous within itself.” This article was amended on 30 November 2022. A previous version stated that Nick Fuentes, in a live stream, appeared to endorse Ron DeSantis. A reference to these remarks has been clarified.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images Nicole Narea covered politics at Vox. She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic. Former President Donald Trump revived his familiar flirtation with white extremism last week after he dined with the rapper Ye , who has recently come under fire for his antisemitic comments, and prominent white supremacist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago. Over the years, Trump has repeatedly egged on white supremacists &mdash; who believe that white people are inherently superior &mdash; and white nationalists, who desire a physical or symbolic white nation, with racist dog whistles . At times, he has even overtly defended them. His affiliation has given a bigger platform to hate-based movements broadly, and they, in turn, have become an indispensable part of his base. The groups became emboldened in the Trump era to make their views more explicit: For instance, during the January 6 insurrection, protesters carried a Confederate flag into the US Capitol, erected a gallows and noose on the lawn , and evoked a seminal white nationalist text. Trump has never said explicitly that he supports white nationalism or white supremacy and, as president, repeatedly denounced antisemitism , though he later criticized American Jews for not showing enough gratitude for his support of Israel. (His daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are Jewish.) On the record, he has disavowed the Ku Klux Klan and its former leader David Duke, who endorsed him for president in 2016, as well as condemned white nationalists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups. Still, he&rsquo;s continually taken pains not to alienate white extremists, leaving himself room for plausible deniability such that his supporters find no need to question their fealty. Last week&rsquo;s dinner, which occurred just a week after Trump announced his 2024 bid for the presidency, should dispel any doubt that Trump had left his alliance with white extremists behind him. His advisers reportedly told him that associating with people like Fuentes is political suicide, and he issued a statement claiming he didn&rsquo;t invite Fuentes and didn&rsquo;t know who he was. Notably, Trump&rsquo;s statement did not denounce Fuentes&rsquo;s or Ye&rsquo;s beliefs, but merely noted Ye &ldquo;expressed no anti-Semitism,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Nick Fuentes.&rdquo; Fuentes is both a white supremacist and a white nationalist who has praised fascists and authoritarian leaders, has connections to American neo-Nazism, and believes that the US should have a white Christian majority . He attended the August 2017 &ldquo;Unite the Right&rdquo; rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and was present at the Capitol insurrection. Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has publicly embraced antisemitism in recent months, losing his contract with Adidas over comments such as his statement that he would &ldquo;go death con 3 [sic] on JEWISH PEOPLE,&rdquo; seemingly referencing the &ldquo;defcon&rdquo; military alert. And after wearing a T-shirt that read &ldquo; white lives matter ,&rdquo; he was accused of abusing the language of Black power to promote white supremacy. Ye posted, then deleted, a video on Twitter Thursday claiming that Trump was &ldquo;really impressed with Fuentes,&rdquo; whom he described as &ldquo;actually a loyalist.&rdquo; CNN&rsquo;s Maeve Reston and Kristen Holmes reported that Trump found Fuentes&rsquo;s &ldquo;abilities to rattle off statistics and data, and his familiarity with Trump world,&rdquo; particularly interesting, and that he said he &ldquo;liked&rdquo; Fuentes. But the former president has since tried to distance himself from both Ye and Fuentes. He called Ye a &ldquo;seriously troubled man&rdquo; and claimed that Fuentes &ldquo;unexpectedly showed up&rdquo; as Ye&rsquo;s guest to dinner, which he described as &ldquo;quick and uneventful.&rdquo; Critically, Trump stopped short of denouncing Fuentes, apparently out of fear that he would alienate potential voters . And that&rsquo;s a reminder of just how closely Trump is tied to Fuentes&rsquo;s cause, and the extent to which he has been willing to cater to the white extremist agenda for his own political gain. Trump has a longstanding relationship with white extremism Trump has made himself an icon of white extremists by time and time again surrounding himself with advisers sympathetic to their views. His disavowals of them, usually offered only when he was pressed by reporters, haven&rsquo;t been overly forceful, and he&rsquo;s made racist statements of his own, further normalizing their views. His former White House adviser Stephen Miller, a proponent of the &ldquo; Great Replacement theory ,&rdquo; described by the Anti-Defamation League as a philosophy of &ldquo;fear that whites will become a powerless minority in the face of changing demographics,&rdquo; was found to have recommended white nationalist websites and literature in private emails uncovered by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Miller remains in Trump&rsquo;s orbit; he attended the former president&rsquo;s 2024 announcement speech. Steve Bannon, Trump&rsquo;s former White House chief strategist and campaign head, tried to distance himself from white nationalists in the wake of the Charlottesville rally, but told a French far-right crowd in 2018 that they should wear the &ldquo; racist &rdquo; label proudly. During his time in the White House, he also pushed an agenda of &ldquo;economic nationalism,&rdquo; which, as my colleague Sean Collins noted, has been &ldquo;criticized as rebranded white nationalism.&rdquo; As president, Trump praised prominent white extremist figures or at least declined to condemn them. In 2017, after a driver ran over counterprotesters at the Unite the Right rally and killed Heather Heyer, Trump said that there were &ldquo;some very fine people on both sides.&rdquo; He claimed that there were many people who attended the rally who were not white nationalists or neo-Nazis and that they had been treated &ldquo;absolutely unfairly.&rdquo; (He later clarified that neo-Nazis and white nationalists &ldquo;should be condemned totally&rdquo; and signed a joint congressional resolution that did so, but his remarks were seen as too tepid a condemnation and overly generous to the rally-goers.) President Joe Biden claimed those remarks were part of the reason he decided to run for president. Later in his tenure, Trump defended Kyle Rittenhouse, the teen who killed two people and injured another amid Black Lives Matter protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020. Rittenhouse &mdash; who was seen fraternizing with members of the far-right group the Proud Boys, and flashing a white power symbol &mdash; was acquitted of the murder charges against him after he argued that the killings were in self-defense. The far right rejoiced at the verdict , and Trump invited Rittenhouse to Mar-a-Lago, calling him &ldquo; really a nice young man .&rdquo; Trump refused to denounce the Proud Boys when prompted to do so at a 2020 presidential debate, telling them to &ldquo;stand back and stand by.&rdquo; The January 6 insurrection was seen as, in part, a manifestation of white racial resentment that Trump attempted to harness to overturn the 2020 election, refusing for hours to call off his supporters as they stormed the Capitol. When he finally did tell them to go home, he said, &ldquo; we love you, you&rsquo;re very special .&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s history of racism &mdash; which is a belief separate from but foundational to white nationalism and white supremacy &mdash; is well documented. It spans decades, from the US government suing him after finding evidence he refused to rent to Black people in the 1970s, to his first address as a presidential candidate in 2016, when he said that Mexico was &ldquo;not sending their best. &hellip; They&rsquo;re bringing drugs. They&rsquo;re bringing crime. They&rsquo;re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.&rdquo; Notably, in 2018, he reportedly referred to Haiti and countries in Africa as &ldquo;shithole countries&rdquo; and called for more immigrants from places like Norway, which has a majority-white population. He&rsquo;s used and continues to use racist nicknames for Covid-19, and has suggested Vice President Kamala Harris &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t meet the requirements&rdquo; to hold her office. In his post-presidency, Trump has leaned even more heavily into white grievance politics. At a rally in Arizona earlier this year, he said that &ldquo;white people&rdquo; were being &ldquo;denigrated&rdquo; and &ldquo;discriminated against.&rdquo; And in reference to Covid-19 prevention and treatment, he falsely said that &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re white, you don&rsquo;t get the vaccine, or if you&rsquo;re white, you don&rsquo;t get lifesaving therapeutics.&rdquo; What Trump has not done is make overt calls for a white nation. But his associations and statements align with white extremists and their goals. They have for some time, and his meeting with Ye and Fuentes only represents a continuation of that trend.

In an interview that Dave McKerracher… | by The Dangerous Maybe | Medium Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Sign up Sign in Why Nick Land Hates Hegel The Dangerous Maybe · Follow 29 min read · Dec 26, 2023 -- 3 Listen Share In an interview that Dave McKerracher and I conducted with Slavoj Žižek, I gave a little summary of Nick Land’s philosophy. In this summary, I said something like “Land hates Hegel”, which would be of interest to Žižek, since he is a card-carrying Hegelian. Dave recently reposted our interview with Žižek in the form of short clips (here’s the link to the full playlist). Dave and I are currently trying to organize a discussion (“debate”) between Žižek and Land on the topics of capitalism, artificial intelligence, democracy, equality, culture war, etc. In our second interview with Žižek, he happily agreed to have this discussion with Land. All we need now is for Land to agree to it. Anyway, in the comment section of one of the short clips , some “Hegelian” chimed in to correct my assertion that “Land hates Hegel”. Now, anybody with any familiarity with Land knows that his greatest philosophical enemy is Hegel. In fact, Land (AKA Outsideness) once said on Twitter that “Hegel is brain cancer” — a true term of endearment for a philosopher if ever there was one. However, this wasn’t sufficient proof for the “Hegelian” in the comments, who also claimed that Land often mentions Hegel in ways that have “positive connotations” (spoiler alert: Land doesn’t), so I decided to use this as an opportunity to reflect on Land’s own words on Hegel. I went through every book and essay of Land’s I could find in order to gather up every single direct reference to Hegel Land has ever made. What follows is my response to that “Hegelian”, but the reason why I’m posting this here is because I now intend for it to serve as a resource for anybody engaged in a serious study of Land’s interpretation of Hegel. Here in bold (that’s fitting) is the “Hegelian” commentator’s original comment (everything after that is my response to it): Nick Land doesn’t hate Hegel. As a Hegelian who is quite interested in Nick Land, there are several mentions of Hegel in Fanged Noumena who contain a positive connotation. Criticism is very much present, but Land still labels Hegel as a “high church” philosopher and agrees with Bataille’s interpretation of Hegel as a philosopher who “reached the absolute limit, but then mutilated himself (or something along those lines)”. The only completely negative thing he has said about Hegelian philosophy on X is that it is “brain cancer”. Challenge accepted. I personally think Land publicly declaring on Twitter that “Hegel is brain cancer” is quite sufficient in itself to justify my assertion that Land hates Hegel , since it amounts to saying that Hegel’s philosophy rots your fucking mind away until it dies, but let’s actually take an in-depth look at Land’s own words concerning Hegel. I do not find Land referring to Hegel with any “positive connotations”; rather, I find him either attacking Hegelianism or referring to it with a scholar’s neutrality for the sake of contextualization and conceptual clarification. Land, as a serious philosopher, is fully capable of objectively explicating his opponent’s position without drenching it in vitriol, but that doesn’t make those explications into “positive connotations”. Now, you mentioned Land’s references to Hegel in Fanged Noumena , but you said nothing about The Thirst for Annihilation in which Land frequently discusses Hegel . It’s in that book that Land says that Hegel is one of his philosophical enemies (along with Aquinas and Derrida): In writing this book I have read almost nothing except for Bataille’s Oeuvres Complètes, supplemented only by those writers with whom I have had some previous intimacy, most important of whom are Kant and Nietzsche, but including also Sade, Freud, Marx, Boltzmann, Rimbaud, Miller, and a few others, amongst whom are such enemies as Aquinas, Hegel, and Derrida. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , Bibliography, p. 154) Philosophically speaking, Land does hate Hegel. I’m not saying that Land has some personal vendetta against Hegel, that Land would stab Hegel in the throat if he could, but I am saying that Land stands vehemently opposed to the core of Hegelian philosophy. In that sense, Land hates Hegel. Consider the fact that Hegel’s two major works, his Phenomenology of Spirit and Science of Logic , are each devoted to the modes of experience and thinking of human beings. Phenomenology of Spirit is devoted to the dialectal investigation of modalities of experience, to the study of phenomena, to the appraisal of modes of consciousness, while Science of Logic is focused on the core logico-ontological categories of thought, of Reason, etc. For Land, however, this only makes Hegel the most philosophically sophisticated and nuanced apologist of the Great Indoors, of the anthropocentric Inside, of the Human Security System. Land, on the contrary, is the champion of the Great Outdoors, the Lovecraftian Outside, Lemuria, etc. Land also opposes dialectics to cybernetics. From his perspective, dialectics is essentially a human endeavors — especially a political one. Land has no patient for the whole thing about the struggle between opposing forces and their inevitable reconciliation in a higher synthesis (I reject this reading of the Hegelian dialectic on Žižekian-McGowanian grounds, but that’s another story). Cybernetics, unlike dialectics, is a non-human process. Cybernetics is true materialism insofar as its how matter itself accesses and actualizes the virtual potentialities of the body without organs and the plane of immanence (matter was doing this long before it actualized us with our capacities of experience, thought, and reason). According to Land, the production of the New, that is, “desiring-production”, is rooted in positive feedback loops — these are the circuits of the Outside. For Land, the Hegelian dialectic ultimately remains the differential unfolding of the Same, of the phenomenal Inside, whereas Deleuzo-Guattarian cybernetics facilities alien invasions of radical alterity from the noumenal Outside (the Unknown). For Land, traditional Marxism was rooted in “standing Hegel on his head”, that is, in tarrying with the intrinsic contradictions of the economy and specifically that of the capitalist mode of production. Land celebrates Deleuze and Guattari for taking Marxism and gutting it of “all Hegelianism”, of all talk of dialectical contradiction: The germinal catalyst for Accelerationism was a call in Deleuze &amp; Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus (1972) to “accelerate the process”. Working like termites within the rotting mansion of Marxism, which was systematically gutted of all Hegelianism until it became something utterly unrecognizable, D&amp;G vehemently rejected the proposal that anything had ever “died of contradictions”, or ever would. Capitalism was not born from a negation, nor would it perish from one. ( A Nick Land Reader , ‘Re-Accelerationism’, p. 154) And as Deleuze himself said: This liberation of Marx from Hegel, this reappropriation of Marx, this uncovering of differential and affirmative mechanisms in Marx, isn’t this what Althusser is accomplishing so admirably? In any case, under the false opinions, under the false oppositions, you discover much more explosive systems, unsymmetrical wholes in disequilibrium (fetishes, for example, both economic and psychoanalytic). ( Desert Islands and Other Texts , ‘Gilles Deleuze Talks Philosophy’, p. 145) Ok, now let’s check out Land’s own words on Hegel. Land on Hegel in The Thirst for Annihilation : First things first, the opening chapter of the book titled ‘The Death of Sound Philosophy’ is arguably the best piece of philosophizing Land ever produced. It’s rich in original lines of thought. And it’s in this chapter that we have the majority of the book’s references to Hegel, who is a constant presence in the first fifteen or so pages. I cannot unpack everything Land says here, since Hegel is present for the first 24 pages, but I’ll highlight the key quotations. Hegel considered Kant’s basic failing to be an inability to see that the limits of reason are self-legislated, so that when intelligibility is absolutely consummated the ethical order is recognized as commanding for nature. Spirit must abandon itself to its noumenal extinction in the confidence that it cannot be identified with its perishable pupal stages, but instead finds eternal life in the thinkability of death. Finitude is only possible through a spiritual production transcending and comprehending it as a necessary moment of itself. Humanity becomes God in the mode of a return by expiating its finitude on the cross of history, whereby alterity is neutralized into the reconciliatory phenomenology of absolute spirit=God. So much for the novelty of the Hegelian imagination. Since Hegel the word phenomenology has fallen even further into disrepute. Compared to the majestic pomp of the Hegelian system the philosophy of Edmund Husserl — with which the word ‘phenomenology’ is now inextricably tangled — is a mere neo-Kantian eccentricity. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘The Death of Sound Philosophy’, pp. 6–7) Since Hegel, according to Land, ultimately thought that the destiny of humanity was to transcend its finitude in assimilating and reconciling itself to the Absolute Spirit (God), Hegel is lacking in originality insofar as the structure of this narrative is found in Hinduism and in Christianity. Despite Hegel’s philosophical wizards, he, for Land, remains a generic religious thinker. Land also takes a jab at Hegel for being a phenomenologist, though one with “majestic pomp” when compared to the lowly modesty of Husserl. Land is even harsher in the next quote: In terms of the social dissemination of his discourse Derrida is perhaps our Hegel; an assimilator in the service of ‘the great tradition’ of authoritarian reason and toothless academic professionalism. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘The Death of Sound Philosophy’, p. 20) Land thinks Hegel is a lackey or sycophant of the most authoritarian of all anthropocentric authorities — Reason . Land was always quick to strike at Reason because he viewed it as brimming with hubris insofar as it thinks it can master Nature, tame the Outside. If the Outside was a shark, then we’d definitely need a bigger boat than that of Reason. Cthulhu will not wear the chains of dialectical logic. On top of that, Land views Hegel (and Derrida) as a toothless academic concerned with doing professional philosophy. In opposition to this “professionalism”, Land and the CCRU stroke to make philosophy exciting by turning it into a transgressive subculture that would be a insurrectional force inside academia. Now, Land’s aim in the first chapter is to develop his philosophy of libidinal materialism . Land is retroactively constructing his own lineage of philosophy and it runs from Kant to Schopenhauer to Nietzsche to Freud to Bataille to Deleuze and Guattari to Land. The primary figures in the libidinal materialist tradition, the ones Land identifies with the most, are Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Bataille, and D&amp;G, but Land also has a love/hate relation to Kant and Freud. The thinkers he hates, the ones he fundamentally opposes, are Derrida, Aquinas, Husserl, Heidegger, Lacan, and Hegel most of all. I can’t quote and explicate the first 24 pages of this chapter, but Land makes it quit clear that he is not Hegelian at all. Remember, Land is primarily Deleuzo-Guattarian and if there was one philosopher Deleuze opposed, it was certainly Hegel. Deleuze was very quick to point this out: I myself “did” history of philosophy for a long time, read books on this or that author. But I compensated in various ways: by concentrating, in the first place, on authors who challenged the rationalist tradition in this history (and I see a secret link between Lucretius, Hume, Spinoza, and Nietzsche, constituted by their critique of negativity, their cultivation of joy, the hatred of interiority, the externality of forces and relations, the denunciation of power. . . and so on). What I most detested was Hegelianism and dialectics. ( Negotiations , ‘Letter to a Harsh Critic’, p. 6) I will, however, do my best to briefly summarize the main points regarding Hegelianism sprawled across these 24 pages. On pages 1–5, Land is unpacking the Kantian context of his (Land’s) own philosophizing. He discusses the importance of the “transcendental” and of “critique”, and he explains that Hegel attempted to refine these concepts. Hegel was trying to redeem metaphysics, which Kantian critical philosophy attacked, but from a Kantian perspective. As Land says, “Hegel’s philosophy is the life-support machine of Kantianism” ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘The Death of Sound Philosophy’, p. 3). Land touches on Bataille’s relation to Kant and Hegel (Kojéve’s Hegel) and on the connection between Kantian critique and capitalism. Next, there’s discussion of the difference between Kantian infinity and Hegelian infinity. Land says that the fact that Hegel prostituted himself to the Prussian State only becomes intelligible when we abstractly view such a abject, deceitful, debased gesture as being “definitive humanity” (p. 4). But this, Land states, does not provide us with a justification for philosophically dismissing Hegel, since, in truth, “Hegel remains strictly unintelligible to us, and any claims to the contrary are anaemic tokens of bourgeois apologetic” (p. 4). We can’t justify dismissing Hegel, since no one has ever truly understood him and those who claim they have offer nothing but boring and uninteresting “tokens”, i.e., middle-class (PMC) excuses for Hegel’s State-conformism. On pages 5–8 house Land’s interpretation of Hegel’s reworking of the Kantian thing-in-itself as well as the difference between how Hegel and Schelling conceptualized the transcendental (Land’s explication is of the highest order while still maintaining his anti-Hegelian position). There’s a couple references to Hegel in passing on pp. 11–14, but they’re really not noteworthy. Things, however, get interesting again on p. 16. From pages 16–20, Land unpacks Derrida’s “method” of deconstruction and it’s relation to Hegel (among many other relations). And the final mention of Hegel in this chapter is on p. 23, which connects Hegel and Aristotle on the principle of all determination is negation. That’s it. No where does Land heap any praise on Hegel. One thing is clear to me: nowhere in these 24 pages does Land ever write Hegel a love letter. Moving on. In Land’s discussion of libidinal energetics found in ‘The Curse of the Sun’, Land argues that a materialist theory of desire will involve the concept of work being “freed of its Hegelian pathos” ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘The Curse of the Sun’, p. 42). Ok, Land mentions Hegel three times in ‘Transgression’. The first mention is just Land conceptually clarifying Sade’s “politics” to Hegel’s concept of abstract negation/negative freedom. Where Kant consolidated the modern pact between philosophy and the state, Sade fused literature with crime in the dungeons of both old and new regimes. Sade insisted upon reasoning about God repeating original sin, but even after obliterating him with a blizzard of theoretical discourse his hunger for atheological aggression remained insatiable, Sade does not seek to negotiate with God or the state, but to ceaselessly resist their possibility. Accordingly, his political pamphlets do not appeal for improved institutions, but only for the restless vigilance of armed masses in the streets. ‘Abstract negation’ or ‘negative freedom’ are Hegel’s expressions for this sterilizing resistance which erases the position of the subject. It could equally be described as real death. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘Transgression’, pp. 60–1) The second mention is contains Land’s nicest statement concerning Hegel. Land gives Hegel credit for how meticulous he was in analyzing his juridical concept of crime in the Philosophy of Right , but I can’t bring myself to count this as a “positive connotation”. Why? Because after acknowledging Hegel’s philosophical meticulousness towards the concept of crime, Land immediately goes on to say that this very juridical concept of crime is all wrong. Simply put, according to Land, Hegel’s concept of crime is bullshit. If transgression appears as the negation of law, it is only because law is coextensive with the unachievable negation of solar flow, just as base matter is deemed negative because it exhibits no resistance to death. Nevertheless, insofar as crime receives its formulation in the court-room it is quite properly understood as a speculative development of legality, as Hegel demonstrates so meticulously in his Philosophy of Right. Such an apprehension of crime through the optic of the trial is no merely empirical projection, but a bias rooted in the juridical advantage of existence. Death has no representatives. Which is to say that transgression has no subject. There is only the sad wreck who Nietzsche calls ‘the pale criminal’, de Rais at his trial for instance, terrified of Satan, separated from his crimes by an unnavigable gulf of oblivion. The truth of transgression, at once utterly simple and yet ungraspable, is that evil does not survive to be judged. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘Transgression’, pp. 70–1) The third and final mention is a mere gloss on Hegel’s development of Kant’s theory of justice. However difficult or repellent the matter at stake might be, we can scarcely avoid the search for the sense of transgression, which is the requirement of relating it to the Kantianism which forms our philosophical actuality. It is because Kant completes the understanding of the difference between laws and cases that his involvement is already implicit in any attempt to judge crimes. (Hegel will of course suggest that to merely understand justice is still insufficient, and that it remains to justify it.) ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘Transgression’, p. 72) There is a single reference to Hegel in Chapter Five and its one Land makes only in passing; he’s just saying that Western history has long emphasized that human beings are beings who must wrestle with death (mortality). From the first verse of John’s Gospel to Hegel’s Science of Logic, and beyond, Western history traverses a thanatological plateau. Man is the animal that knows it will die, determined in its essence by a knowledge whose specific mode is an immortalizing sublimation. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘Dear God’, p. 83) There are references to Hegel on one page of ‘The Rage of Jealous Time’. Here, Land is opposing Hegel’s concept of determinate negation to what Land calls “ferocious negation”. We can think of the former as an Inside-negation and the latter as an Outside-negation. The in- of indetermination can only be read as either the formal negation or the speculative development of determination if it is itself understood as eliminative, which is to say, determinate. Such a move is of course — when fully explicit — Hegelianism itself. Quite different is the indeterminate sense of indeterminate negation, which is not eliminative, but ferocious. Ferocious negation is radically heterogenous in respect to the annihilation it effects, so that it is intrinsic to its definition that it cannot be derived from its eliminative consequences by either formal or speculative logic. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘The Rage of Jealous Time’, p. 103) Land would return to the question concerning Hegel and negation many years later: §103 — Abstract negation, as Hegel perhaps understood, in deriding it, is the only kind that escapes. He recoils from a negativity that does no work or even (precisely) the opposite, and which redoubles without self-cancelation while still turning endlessly into itself. Abstract negation is already a doubling, of such redundancy that it sheds the pretense to generic negativity like Ouroboros skin — and in fact like nothing at all. ( Chasm , p. 137) In the chapter ‘Fanged Noumenon (Passion of the Cyclone)’, Land writes: The noumenon is the absence of the subject, and is thus inaccessible in principle to experience. If there is still a so-called ‘noumenal subject’ in the opening phase of the critical enterprise it is only because a residue of theological reasoning conceives a stratum of the self which is invulnerable to transition, or synonymous with time as such. This is the ‘real’ or ‘deep’ subject, the self or soul, a subject that sloughs-off its empirical instantiation without impairment, the immortal subject of mortality. It only remains for Hegel to rigorously identify this subject with death, with the death necessitated by the allergy of Geist to its finitude, to attain a conception of deaths for itself. But this is all still the absence of the subject, even when ‘of’ is translated into the subjective genitive, and at zero none of it makes any difference. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘Fanged Noumenon’, p. 110) Land is simply laying out the conceptual developments in the concept of the noumenal subject, which entails a historical gloss on Hegel’s development of it, which comes to identify noumenal subjectivity with death itself. Next up we turn to the two references to Hegel in the chapter called ‘Aborting the Human Race’. First, Land refers to Hegel’s striving for Auflösung (resolution, sublation, reconciliation, Aufhebung , synthesis) as “pitifully stupid”. Land writes, “The dissipation of the soul would not relate to thought as an object of theoretical representation. There would be something almost touching about Hegel’s clutching for philosophical Auflösung if it were not so pitifully stupid” ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘Aborting the Human Race’’, p. 152) When I asked my Todd McGowan, author of Emancipation After Hegel: Achieving a Contradictory Revolution , about Hegel’s Auflösung (and Land’s interpretation of it), he said: This is what happens to contradiction as one moves from moment to moment in the dialectic. Auflösung can be translated either as the resolution or the dissolution of contradiction. Obviously, I would lean to the former rather than the latter. I have to confess that I have no idea at all what that first sentence from Land means. But the second misreads Hegel’s entire project, in my view, since there is Auflösung doesn’t ultimately eliminate contradiction for Hegel. That’s pretty clear to me. Second, Land describes how Bataille and Nietzsche are opposed to “Kantian industrialism” and its associations to Hegel and teleology (“industrialism” here means the pursuit of success, profit, achievement of a goal, procurement of self-interest, etc). Obviously, Land sides with Bataille and Nietzsche against Kant and Hegel, with “the naked risk of chaos, war, eroticism, and surrender to the sacred”. Against the abortive consolidation of Kantian industrialism associated with Hegel and teleology, Bataille counterposes Nietzsche and the naked risk of chaos, war, eroticism, and surrender to the sacred. ( The Thirst for Annihilation , ‘Aborting the Human Race’, p. 157) That’s all Land says about Hegel in The Thirst for Annihilation . The closest Land ever comes to praising Hegel is when he (Land) said that he (Hegel) was “meticulous” in his examination of the juridical concept of crime. Every other reference to Hegel is either negative or neutral (neutral for scholarly purposes). Let’s now move on to the references to Hegel in Fanged Noumena . Land on Hegel in Fanged Noumena : In all of the 666 pages of Fanged Noumena (by the way, not a coincidence), Hegel only shows up on 23 pages and usually only in passing. Before getting to Land’s own words, I want to look at two quotes from Robin Mackay and Ray Brassier as well as one quote from Mark Fisher (all three of whom have greater familiarity with Land’s philosophy than any of us do, since both Mackay and Fisher were members of the CCRU and Brassier was a close associate of theirs). In the Editor’s Introduction to Fanged Noumena , Mackay and Brassier wrote: Fuelled by disgust at the more stupefying inanities of academic ortho­doxy and looking to expectorate the vestigial theological superstitions afflicting mainstream post-Kantianism, Land seized upon Deleuze-Guattari’s transcendental material­ism — years before its predictable institutional neutering — and subjected it to ruthless cybernetic streamlining, excising all vestiges of Bergsonian vitalism to reveal a deviant and explicitly thanatropic machinism. The results of this reconstructive surgery provide the most illumi­nating but perhaps also the most disturbing distillation of what Deleuze called ‘transcendental empiricism’. In Land’s work, this becomes the watchword for an experimental praxis oriented entirely towards contact with the unknown. Land sought out this exteriority, the impersonal and anonymous chaos of absolute time, as fervently as he believed Kantianism and Hegelianism, along with their contemporary heirs, deconstruction and critical theory, were striving to keep it out. ( Fanged Noumena , Editor’s Introduction, p. 5) Land notes how philosophic reason (ratio), whose most symptomatic representative is of course Hegel, has systematically turned away from the contingent or nomadic ‘strewing’ of real difference, preferring to subordinate it to ideal order, and ultimately to identity. Land concurs with Deleuze’s Nietzsche and Philosoph y in crediting Nietzsche with the inception of a ‘post-Aristotelian’ but non-dialectical ‘logic’ of gradation without negativity. It is this ‘logic’ that attains its fullest and most sophisticated articulation in Deleuze-Guattari’s ‘stratoanalysis’. ( Fanged Noumena , Editor’s Introduction, pp. 22–3) Both of these quotes point out how Land’s philosophy is radically opposed to that of Hegel’s. Land finds in Deleuze and Nietzsche the two great anti-Hegelian philosophers, which would make Land the third. And we also find Mark Fisher echoing this in his little summary of Land’s (anti-vitalist) Deleuzo-Guattarian philosophy: What, then, is Land’s philosophy about? In a nutshell: Deleuze and Guattari’s machinic desire remorselessly stripped of all Bergsonian vitalism, and made backwards-compatible with Freud’s death drive and Schopenhauer’s Will. The Hegelian-Marxist motor of history is then transplanted into this pulsional nihilism: the idiotic autonomic Will no longer circulating on the spot, but upgraded into a drive, and guided by a quasi-teleological artificial intelligence attractor that draws terrestrial history over a series of intensive thresholds that have no eschatological point of consum­mation, and that reach empirical termination only contingently if and when its material substrate burns out. This is Hegelian-Marxist historical materialism inverted: Capital will not be ultimately unmasked as exploited labour power; rather, humans are the meat puppet of Capital, their identities and self-understandings are simulations that can and will be ultimately be sloughed off. (‘Terminator vs Avatar’, # ACCELERATE: The Accelerationist Reader , p. 342) When I say that Land hates Hegel, philosophically speaking, I have Mackay, Brassier, and Fisher, on my side. Time to check out Land’s own words on Hegel in Fanged Noumena. I’m not going to quote every mention of Hegel, but I will note each one and give a brief interpretation. Ok, Land does mention Hegel some relative frequency in ‘Narcissism and Dispersion in Heidegger’s 1953 Trakl Interpretation’ (all the references in this essay run from pages 105–9). Starting on p. 105, Deleuze discusses Hegel within the context of real differences (in the Deleuzean sense) and their relations to mathematics and cosmology. Land, of course, will oppose the Deleuzean concept of difference to that of Hegel’s as well as Hegel’s interpretation of cosmological elements, e.g., stars, the distribution of stars, starlight. Land brings up Hegel theory of cosmology and its relation to difference in order to contrast Hegel’s position with Trakl’s (whom Land sides with). Here’s the core of the debate: The fading of stars is, therefore, among other things, a name for a necessary stage in Hegel’s system. The senseless distribu­tion of stellar material is repressed in the interest of the particularized(sub-)planetary body, which in turn furthers geocentrism and the infinitizing of light. is movement crushes difference under a logicized notion of significance. In contrast, Trakl brings the thought of the sign together with that of stellar dispersion. ( Fanged Noumena, ‘Narcissism and Dispersion in Heidegger’s 1953 Trakl Interpretation’, p. 109) Land brings up Hegel again in ‘Delighted to Death’ on pages 125–6. Here, Land points out that Hegel ended up working out the speculative type of philosophical system that Kant had only dreamt of producing. Then Land quotes Hegel’s description of the French revolution and the secular freedom it sought to unleash, which Land, then, connects to Sade. That’s all for that essay (no positive connotations here). But we do get one mention of Hegel in ‘Art as Insurrection: the Question of Aesthetics in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche’. In it, Land defends Kant’s concept of genius (“unconscious creative energy”) against the post-Kantian reductions of it found in Schelling, Hegel, and even Schopenhauer — Land, therefore, is being anti-Hegelian here. Here it is: Irrational surplus, or the ineliminable and beautiful danger of unconscious creative energy: nature with fangs. How do we hold on to this thought? It is perpetually by collapse; by a reversion to a depressive philosophy of work, whether theological or humanistic. The three great strands of post-Kantian exploration — marked by the names Hegel, Schelling, and Schopenhauer — are constantly tempted by the prospect of a reduction to forgotten or implicit labour; to the agency of God, spirit, or man, to anything that would return this ruthless artistic force of the generative unconscious to design, intention, project, teleology. Kant’s word ‘genius’ is the immensely difficult and confused but emphatic resistance to such reductions; the thought of an utterly impersonal creativity that is historically registered as the radical discontinuity of the example, of irresponsible legislation, as ‘order’ without anyone giving the orders. ( Fanged Noumena , ‘Art as Insurrection’, p. 151) Next up is ‘Spirit and Teeth’. All of the references to Hegel are located on pp. 175–7. Obviously, Land is going to have to discuss Hegel if he’s going to discuss Spirit ( Geist ). On p. 175, Land is just setting up the historical and philosophical context of the meaning of “Spirit”, which, of course, must center around Hegel. This brings us to the quote you mentioned. You cited this one as evidence of Land referring to Hegel with positive connotations, but I hate to break it to you that this is an example of the exact opposite. Check it out: But as for spirit! — that can only be parody or nostalgia. Who could still use such a word without humor or disdain? Spirit is less a misleading or dangerous word than a ridiculous one; a Coelecanth of a word. Yet it persists: the mark of a clownish incompetence at death . Such incompetence has its doctrine, rituals, and lit­urgy, its orthodoxies and heresies. It is the entire and prolonged refusal of the impersonal summarizable as ‘phenomenology.’ Whether high-church (Hegel), or low-church (Husserl), phenomenology is the definitive ideology of propriety; systematically employing the inter­rogative mode in order to distill out everything for which proper subjectivity cannot claim responsibility, and thus entrenching the humanistic dimension of Western phi­losophy ever more rigidly. ( Fanged Noumena , ‘Spirit and Teeth’, p. 176) First off, the word “church” itself carries negative connotations for Land (at least it did for young Land), since the Church is essential part of the Human Security System. The Church is precisely what guards us against “fanged noumena”, which Land would prefer to be devoured by. Also, one of Land’s main philosophical targets is phenomenology. The whole thing about fixating on the structures and interiority of our experiences is repulsive to Land. Phenomenology simply amounts to the exploration and strengthening of the Great Indoors. Land is absolutely at war, philosophically speaking, with phenomenology — be it the ornate or “Catholic” (high-church) phenomenology of Hegel or the humble or “Protestant” (low-church) of Husserl. But Land’s last reference to Hegel in this text relates to this point: “If spirit largely disappears between Hegel and Husserl it is because, compared to the transcendental ego, it seems a little too complicit with the outside” ( Fanged Noumena , ‘Spirit and Teeth’, p. 176). The idea is that “spirt” disappears in Husserl’s phenomenology precisely because it had a little too much Outsideness about for Husserl. The point is that Hegel’s phenomenon of Spirit was not phenomenological enough for Husserl. We find two mentions of Hegel in ‘After the Law’. On p. 231, Land laughs off attempts to identify history with the meaning of the West as “incredible” (ridiculous), which, for Land, is a project attempted by Plato, Aquinas, and Hegel. Those seeking to defend the human management of social processes (where ‘man’ speculatively unites with the God of anthropomorphic monotheism) can have no project but to restore a history whose ideal sense would reconnect with the meaning of the West , such as those prof­fered by Plato, Aquinas and Hegel. Such restoration is a modernist aspiration which strikes me as incredible. ( Fanged Noumena , ‘After the Law’, p. 231) And the only other reference to Hegel (p. 250) in this particular essay is merely a gloss on Hegel’s fascination with the dialectical image of war. Let’s move on to ‘Making it with Death: Remarks on Thanatos and Desiring-Production’. On p. 261, Land only brings up Hegel to say that Deleuze and the context of his philosophizing must not be reduced to the reaction against Hegel that was so stylish in France during the late 1960s. The next mention on p. 262 simply makes a distinction between two streams of modern philosophy of which Nietzsche is one and Hegel is the other. Land talks about how Hegelian philosophy sought to speculatively revitalize politics in the “wake of Capital”. Land will go on to further distinguish Deleuze from Hegel: It is not Hegel’s social managerialism that is most relevantly contrasted with Deleuzian nomadism. Hegelianism was only ever the black humour of modern history. It is rather the non-exclusive polity of decon­struction or cruder neo-Kantian liberal theories, with their abstractly re-composable humanities, which are the true counterpole to Deleuze’s anti-political economism. ( Fanged Noumena , ‘Making it with Death’, p. 264) And the last mention is a gloss on the Hegelian struggle for recognition: A consummate libidinal materialism is distinguished by its complete indifference to the category of work. Wherever there is labour or struggle there is a repression of the raw creativity which is the atheological sense of matter and which — because of its anegoic effortlessness — seems identical with dying. Work, on the other hand, is an idealist principle used as a supplement or compensation for what matter cannot do. One only ever works against matter, which is why labour is able to replace violence in the Hegelian struggle for recognition. ( Fanged Noumena , ‘Making it with Death’, pp. 286–7) Next, we have the three Hegel references in ‘Circuitries’ (none of which carry any positive connotations). The first one attacks the “decaying Hegelian socialist heritage”. The second one refers to Hegelianism as involving a “preposterous humanism”. The third speaks of how it’s in Hegel’s theory of judgment that the doctrine of judgment reaches its “senile dementia”. Take a look for yourself. Traditional schemas which oppose technics to nature, to literate culture, or to social relations, are all dominated by a phobic resistance to the side-lining of human intelligence by the coming techno sapiens . Thus one sees the decaying Hegelian socialist heritage clinging with increasing desperation to the theological sentimentalities of praxis, reification, alienation, ethics, autonomy, and other such mythemes of human creative sovereignty. ( Fanged Noumena , ‘Circuitries’, p. 294) Deleuze and Guattari are amongst the great cyberneticists, but that they also surrender cybernetics to its modernist definition is exhibited in a remark on capital in The Anti-Oedipus : “an axiomatic of itself is by no means a simple technical machine, not even an automatic or cybernetic machine”. It is accepted that cybernetics is beyond mere gadgetry (“not even”), it has something to do with automation, and yet axiomatics exceeds it. This claim is almost Hegelian in its preposterous humanism. ( Fanged Noumena , ‘Circuitries’, p. 297) Transcendental philosophy is the consummation of philosophy construed as the doctrine of judgment, a mode of thinking that finds its zenith in Kant and its senile dementia in Hegel. Its architecture is determined by two fundamental principles: the linear application of judgment to its object, form to intuition, genus to species, and the non-directional reciprocity of relations, or logical symmetry. Judgment is the great fiction of transcendental philosophy, but cybernetics is the reality of critique. Where judgment is linear and non-directional, cyber­netics is non-linear and directional. It replaces linear appli­cation with the non-linear circuit, and non-directional logical relations with directional material flows. The cybernetic dissolution of judgment is an integrated shift from transcendence to immanence, from domination to control, and from meaning to function. Cybernetic innovation replaces transcendental constitution, design loops replace faculties. (‘Circuitries’, Fanged Noumena , pp. 267–8) And, finally, we get the single “mention” of Hegel in ‘Meltdown’, which is not really a mention, since Land is talking about “re-Hegelianized ‘western marxism’”, but notice that he does refer to this re-Hegelianizing of Marxism in negative terms, e.g., “degenerates”, “state-sympathizing monotheology”, “siding with fascism”: The Superiority of Far Eastern Marxism. Whilst Chinese materialist dialectic denegativizes itself in the direction of schizophrenizing systems dynamics, progres­sively dissipating top-down historical destination in the Tao-drenched Special Economic Zones, a re-Hegelianized ‘western marxism’ degenerates from the critique of politi­cal economy into a state-sympathizing monotheology of economics, siding with fascism against deregulation. The left subsides into nationalistic conservatism, asphyxiating its vestigial capacity for ‘hot’ speculative mutation in a morass of ‘cold’ depressive guilt-culture. ( Fanged Noumena , ‘Meltdown’, pp. 447–8) That all the Hegel references we get in Fanged Noumena . Where exactly are all the positive connotations your spoke of? I’m having real trouble finding any of them. It’s like you were . . . I don’t know . . . talking out of your ass. Anyway, let’s move on to The Dark Enlightenment . Land on Hegel in The Dark Enlightenment : Land only brings up Hegel three times in The Dark Enlightenment . In the first one, Land is indirectly opposing Hegel’s privileging of abstract theory over concrete facts (on this point, Land is tapped into his roots of British empiricism). The second mention indirectly and subtly links Hegel to liberal PMCs in the Cathedral and to their God-State. The third mention just connects Hegelian dialectics to our modern-day court dramas, our “show trials”. That’s all we get of Land discussing Hegel in this text. Here are the three quotes: “If the facts do not agree with the theory, so much worse for the facts” Hegel asserted. It is the Zeitgeist that is God, historically incarnated in the state, trampling mere data back into the dirt. By now, everybody knows where this ends. An egalitarian moral ideal, hardened into a universal axiom or increasingly incontestable dogma, completes modernity’s supreme historical irony by making ‘tolerance’ the iron criterion for the limits of (cultural) toleration. Once it is accepted universally, or, speaking more practically, by all social forces wielding significant cultural power, that intolerance is intolerable , political authority has legitimated anything and everything convenient to itself, without restraint. ( The Dark Enlightenment , Part 3, pp. 25–6) Even amongst libertarian-slanted conservatives, a firm commitment to ‘natural rights’ is unlikely to proceed confidently and emphatically to their divine origination. For modern ‘liberals’, believers in the rights-bestowing (or entitlement) State, such archaic ideas are not only absurdly dated, but positively obstructive. For that reason, they are associated less with revered predecessors than with the retarded, fundamentalist thinking of political enemies. Sophisticates of the Cathedral core understand, as Hegel did, that God is no more than deep government apprehended by infants, and as such a waste of faith (that bureaucrats could put to better use). ( The Dark Enlightenment , Part 4, p. 35) Dialectical enthusiasm finds its definitive expression in a courtroom drama that combines lawyers, journalists, community activists, and other agents of the revolutionary superstructure in the production of a show trial. Social contradictions are staged, antagonistic cases articulated, and resolution institutionally expected. This is Hegel for prime-time television (and now for the Internet). It is the way that the Cathedral shares its message with the people. ( The Dark Enlightenment , Part 4b, p. 56) Land on Hegel in Crypto-Current : In Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy , we get six references to Hegel — all of which are in footnotes. These references are made for historical and philosophical clarification. I don’t think any of them merit exegesis, but here they are in case you want to inspect them for yourself. The ‘thought’ that matters is produced in advance of any explicitly philosophical apprehension. (This fatality will no doubt evoke Hegel’s “Owl of Minerva” among those receptive to speculative communization, whose problems will be touched upon later in this book.) ( Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy , footnote 12) Kant explicitly denies intellectual intuition to man. This is a proscription that has been generally considered foundational for philosophical anthropology in the Western tradition. It anticipates a technical apprehension of write-protected programming, as this arises within genomics, neurology, and electronic software. A proscribed loop secures the foundations of a being against the meddling of that being. Theology intersects with robotics at this junction, where technology identifies its own temptation to ‘play God’. Within Occidental philosophy, sustained attention to the problem of intellectual intuition reaches its apex in German idealism, where it rapidly transforms into a revolt against the Kantian proscription, and even against the theological order of the universe. Schelling, most notably, conceived intellectual intuition radically as “the organ of all transcendental thinking” ( Organ alles transzendentalen Denkens ), presupposed by the mere existence of transcendental philosophy (as its condition of possibility). Only insofar as the boundaries of Kantian philosophical anthropology had already been crossed could the critical enterprise have even been imaginable. The Hegelian completion of German Idealism elaborates itself from this contention as if from an elementary formula. In the determination of a limit, Reason has already superseded it. We will have continuous occasion to challenge this speculative idealist resolution of the problem, on fundamentalist Kantian grounds, throughout this work. ( Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy , footnote 67) The critical argument basic to Marx’s analysis of capital is that labor power, the transcendental condition of possibility for all social production (of commodities/objects), is itself subjected to objectification as a commodity. Capital production is thus denounced, implicitly, as a materialized metaphysics, or a system of illegitimate objectification. This theoretical identification of a systematic confusion grounds the Marxian theory of exploitation, since under normal capitalistic conditions, labor power is traded at a price consistent with the labor inputs required for its social reproduction, rather than that of its own productive capacity. Transcendental dialectic is no longer primarily expressed as insoluble philosophical disputation, but rather as class struggle. The contention that such antagonism is productive (and not merely a sterile diversion of theoretical attention) reflects Marx’s Hegelian departure from the Kantian matrix, and the conversion of the antinomies of pure reason into historical dialectics. ( Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy , footnote 75) From a certain perspective — which is not itself isolable as a ‘left-wing’ or ‘right-wing’ theoretical orientation — there is no right-wing politics. The political, by its own dialectical logic (of organized controversy and reconciliation), can only reach conclusion on the left. Insofar as social process conforms to a structure of argumentation, its sinister destination is assured originarily, as the Left Hegelians were the first to distinctively, if only implicitly — and not (of course) at all uncontroversially — comprehend. For the right, agreement to pursue the social argument is already to lose it. ( Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy , footnote 163) ‘Nature’ is denounced as the mystified representation of alienated collective desire. This is sheer Schopenhauer, in an ironical, communistic configuration. The deep structure of critique has pre-programmed it, by setting the topic for a multi-century project of institutional absorption (whether conceived as a process of statist-Hegelian formation applied to critical-Schopenhauerean matter, or as a political-institutional interiorization of the thing-in-itself). ( Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy , footnote 167) The cultural homology with a religious myth of incarnation is unmistakable. When conceived as a positive philosophical project of social theology, the outcome is Hegelianism, which is to say speculative metaphysics without regret. ( Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy , footnote 213) Conclusion: I want to say that there are no direct references to Hegel in any of the following works by Land: CCRU Writings 1997–2003 , Templexity, Calendric Dominion , Suspended Animation , Xinjiang Horizons , Shanghai Times , Dragon Tales , Phil-Undhu , and Xenosystems Fragments (the single reference to “Hegelianism” is in the essay ‘Re-Accelerationism’, which I already quoted, but I cited it from the collection titled A Nick Land Reader — the essay is contained in both volumes — so I don’t count that one). . Now, what I’m not going to do is comb through the archives of all of Land’s blogs just to see if he ever mentioned Hegel in any of his unpublished writings. If you want to undertake that project just to show that Land once said something really nice about Hegel, then have it. With all that being said, with all this exegetical evidence counting as propositions in my argument, I’ll end with the following conclusion: Therefore, Land hates Hegel . Merry Christmas!

His book on democracy, The Reactionary Spirit , was published 0n July 16. You can purchase it here. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s weekend dinner with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes &mdash; two figures who have become the face of modern-day antisemitism in America &mdash; has shocked the political world. For Jews, the dinner was more than simply shocking: It was a reminder of an old and very ugly history of influential Americans mainstreaming antisemitism. In 1918, industrialist Henry Ford purchased his hometown newspaper, the Dearborn Independent. Ford was a brilliant businessman, the inventor of the Model T and founder of the iconic car company bearing his name. He was also a hardcore antisemite, blaming Jews for everything from World War I to an alleged decline in the quality of candy bars . Ford turned the Dearborn Independent into a vehicle for promoting his antisemitic obsessions. In 1920, the paper published a series of articles, titled &ldquo;The International Jew,&rdquo; on the alleged nefarious activities of Jews in the United States and elsewhere. The series included excerpts from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , an infamous Russian forgery that purported to be records of the Jewish conspiracy&rsquo;s worldwide activities. Because Ford required Ford Motors dealers to distribute the paper , turning it into the second-largest in the United States at the time, his pet conspiracy theories were sent to a massive audience. The impact was enormous; according to historian Norman Cohn , &ldquo;The International Jew probably did more than any other work to make The Protocols world famous.&rdquo; Ford&rsquo;s propaganda set the stage for a wave of American antisemitism in the runup to World War II, including the rise of infamous antisemitic demagogue Father Charles Coughlin. In 1931, with the Nazis on the brink of taking control of Germany&rsquo;s government, a Detroit News reporter asked Hitler about Ford. &ldquo;I regard Henry Ford as my inspiration,&rdquo; the soon-to-be F&uuml;hrer replied , a framed portrait of the American industrialist over his desk. Nearly 100 years later, Donald Trump &mdash; also an avowed fan of Henry Ford &mdash; would sit down with Fuentes, a man who denies that the Holocaust happened . Fuentes&rsquo;s smirking, &ldquo;just kidding&rdquo; demeanor on his America First webcast barely hides his eliminationist antisemitism &mdash; and sometimes the mask falls off entirely. Former President Donald Trump finishes his speech at the America First Policy Institute’s America First Agenda summit on July 26, 2022. Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images &ldquo;The Jews had better start being nice to people like us,&rdquo; Fuentes said in a mid-November broadcast . &ldquo;Because what comes out of this is going to be a lot uglier and a lot worse for them than anything that&rsquo;s being said on this show.&rdquo; For the past few years, Fuentes has been attempting to insert himself and followers (called &ldquo; groypers &rdquo;) into the Republican Party, getting figures like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ) to attend his America First Political Action conference in February . This weekend was Fuentes&rsquo;s biggest victory yet, a sit-down with the party&rsquo;s most important leader &mdash; who reportedly came away impressed. &ldquo;I really like this guy. He gets me,&rdquo; Trump said of Fuentes, per Axios&rsquo;s Jonathan Swan and Zachary Basu. Meanwhile, West has recently emerged as the highest-profile proponent of antisemitic conspiracy theories in the country, a turn that has generated tremendous backlash &mdash; at least from most corners of society. That Trump sat down with West and Fuentes should not be surprising, his own Jewish family notwithstanding. He has regularly deployed antisemitic rhetoric during his time in public life, and become even more willing to directly engage with his more extreme followers since leaving office (by, for example, regularly promoting QAnon content on his Truth Social website ). Hosting West and Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago is the logical extension of what he&rsquo;s been doing since the beginning of his political career. Leading Republicans are now acting shocked , with some of Trump&rsquo;s allies in the Jewish conservative world turning on him over the dinner. Whether this round of Republican condemnation will end differently than previous ones remains to be seen. But even if this does mark a turning point in Trump&rsquo;s political standing, other Republicans can&rsquo;t unring the antisemitic bell the former president has been banging for years. What has felt like a very recent spike in antisemitism, with high-profile incidents involving West and basketball player Kyrie Irving , is primarily a continuation of events dating back to 2015 kicked off by Trump&rsquo;s rise. His political ascendance has had effects similar to Henry Ford&rsquo;s purchase of the Dearborn Independent, a propaganda victory for antisemites that has helped pull bigotry into the mainstream. There is, of course, a difference between Ford&rsquo;s active trafficking of antisemitic propaganda and Trump&rsquo;s more passive enabling of the same. But the effects of the latter are nonetheless devastating: The last few years have seen an unprecedented spike in antisemitic hate crimes , including the deadliest antisemitic massacre in American history . &ldquo;Historians have called the period between World War I and World War II the &lsquo;high tide&rsquo; of American antisemitism. I think we may have to rename that: I think we are at the moment living in the high tide of American antisemitism,&rdquo; says Pamela Nadell, the director of the Jewish studies program at American University. Nick Fuentes (center) rallies with his followers, known as “groypers,” in Washington, DC, on November 14, 2020. Zach D. Roberts/NurPhoto via Getty Images To be sure, antisemitism is far less socially acceptable now than it was in the 1930s and even the 1960s. But it also seems much more acceptable today than it was prior to 2015 &mdash; and perhaps more lethal than it ever has been in this country. Trump&rsquo;s willingness to openly consort with notorious antisemites suggests things may be on the verge of getting worse, not better. The ebb and flow of American antisemitism To understand the deeper context behind the recent rise in antisemitism, we need to go back nearly 2,000 years. Deborah Lipstadt, a historian currently serving as the State Department special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, traces the structure of antisemitic ideas back to the very origins of Christianity &mdash; specifically, the New Testament description of Jesus&rsquo;s death. The early church taught that &ldquo;the Jews&rdquo; conspired to kill Jesus &mdash; even though Jesus and his apostles were all Jewish and the Romans who actually executed him in the story were not. This, according to Lipstadt, was in part a strategic choice: Christianity had become a competing religion to Judaism, and its leadership wanted to marginalize the older, more deeply rooted tradition. What better way to do that than to blame Jews for killing the literal savior, casting remaining Jews as Christ-denying heirs to a dark conspiracy? &ldquo;Jews, [early Christians] argued, repudiated this new faith because of their inherent maliciousness,&rdquo; Lipstadt writes . &ldquo;This formulation rendered Judaism more than just a competing religion. It became a source of evil.&rdquo; This is the crucial thing to understand about antisemitism: It is both bigotry and an explanatory framework. Jews aren&rsquo;t just detestable people, in the antisemitic mind; they are the force responsible for all that is bad in the world. After Christianity&rsquo;s conquest of the Roman Empire and Europe, blaming the Jews for the world&rsquo;s ills &mdash; from war to famine to pandemic &mdash; became a persistent feature of the European social environment, morphing with the times to explain whatever plagued the continent at the moment. When Europeans moved to North America, they brought this way of thinking along with them. While the American state was far more friendly to Jews than its European peers, thanks to a founding emphasis on religious toleration, the prejudice itself still resided in its population &mdash; just waiting to be brought to the social fore by contingent events. This is why historians like Nadell talk about antisemitism as reaching a &ldquo;high tide.&rdquo; Antisemitism is always there, but its influence in society ebbs and flows depending on what&rsquo;s happening in the world. When it hits historical highs, it&rsquo;s due to a confluence of factors &mdash; a perfect storm of Jew hatred. In the early 1920s, decades of mass immigration, including a surge in Jewish migration, had prompted a nativist backlash. This rising xenophobia, together with a national sense of insecurity created by the post-World War I economic downturn, contributed to a rise in membership for the Ku Klux Klan; by 1925, its cadres claimed between 2 million and 5 million members nationwide. In publishing &ldquo;The International Jew,&rdquo; first as articles and then as a widely distributed book, Henry Ford was pushing on an open door. After World War II and growing public awareness of the Holocaust, antisemitism declined significantly &mdash; but it did not go away. In the 1950s, an influx of Jewish admissions to Stanford University led administrators to secretly impose limits on future Jewish acceptance to the school . Between 1957 and 1958, a wave of bombings hit or targeted eight American synagogues &mdash; white supremacist terror attacks seemingly designed as retaliation for Jewish participation in the civil rights movement . Hundreds of Jewish New Yorkers protest Hitler’s Nazi government and oppression in Germany circa 1933. Bettmann via Getty Images These examples illustrate the reactive nature of antisemitism: how events in the world, be they Jewish success or the Black struggle for civil rights, could inflame antisemitic sentiment even at a time when Nazism&rsquo;s horrors were fresh in American minds. By the 2010s, the situation was very different. While explicit discrimination like the Stanford policy was gone, antisemitic groups flourished on the fringes &mdash; both the militia-style white power groups and the more genteel intellectual antisemites of the &ldquo;alt-right.&rdquo; The rise of the internet, and social media in particular, had given the far right a new ability to network and rapidly disseminate their messages to millions. The kindling for a new antisemitic blaze was there; it just needed a spark. Enter Donald Trump. Why antisemitism is rising today Trump&rsquo;s explicit employment of fringe-right tropes, calling Mexican immigrants rapists, or giving an antisemitic speech to an audience of Republican Jews , gave these movements a massive boost in influence. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s an anti-Semitic enabler,&rdquo; Lipstadt told me in a 2019 interview . &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very careful not to criticize his followers. ... He&rsquo;ll enable anything that&rsquo;s going to get him elected or get him support.&rdquo; Antisemitic hate speech spiked on social media , as did hate crimes in real life. Data from the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish anti-hate group, regularly showed the highest numbers of recorded antisemitic incidents in nearly 40 years of data. While the ADL&rsquo;s data is not perfect , primarily due to overly loose definitions, the precipitous and sustained increase since Trump&rsquo;s entry suggests something really is going on. ADL Nearly every year saw some kind of high-profile incident. We saw antisemitic marchers chanting &ldquo;Jews will not replace us&rdquo; in the streets of Charlottesville in 2017 , and the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh the following year. In 2019, there was another shooting at a synagogue in Poway , California, and the murder of a New York rabbi at a Hanukkah gathering . In 2021, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza led to assaults on Jews in the streets of Manhattan and Los Angeles . Not all of these attacks came from the sort of white nationalists most attracted to Trump. The rabbi&rsquo;s killer owned literature from the Black Hebrew Israelites, a group that believes Black people are the true Jews and that white Jews are nefarious impostors &mdash; a conspiracy theory recently promoted by both Ye and Irving . The attacks during the Israel war in 2021 seemed to originate with supporters of the Palestinian cause. This tracks with the historical pliability of antisemitism. Because it is an explanatory framework in addition to a form of bigotry &mdash; a way that people can blame someone for whatever they&rsquo;re unhappy about &mdash; it can be adapted by nearly any group for any purpose. Henry Ford blamed the Jews for ruining candy bars; Marjorie Taylor Greene blamed California wildfires on a space laser controlled by prominent Jews . Once the social barriers against antisemitism are broken down, and one type of antisemitism bursts into the open, people from all ideological persuasions can feel more comfortable expressing antisemitic ideas. Antisemitism becomes part of the ambient environment, popping up at seemingly random intervals from different sources. The surge in public antisemitism in the fall of 2022 is really an expression of a broader pattern that we&rsquo;ve been seeing since 2015. Which brings us back to the Mar-a-Lago dinner. There&rsquo;s something truly bizarre about Ye, a Black man, bringing a white nationalist like Fuentes to the Mar-a-Lago dinner. But once you grasp the nature of antisemitism, it becomes more comprehensible. For people like Fuentes, it makes sense to publicly support Ye amid his career suicide &mdash; despite his Blackness &mdash; because he&rsquo;s helping spread antisemitic ideas to a wider audience. The Goyim Defense League, a white nationalist antisemitic group, hung banners over LA&rsquo;s 405 highway saying &ldquo; Kanye is right about the Jews .&rdquo; Ye, roundly condemned by mainstream America , took the help where he could get it, allying with Fuentes and handing his movement the major coup of a sit-down with their hero Donald Trump. &ldquo;A former president sitting for dinner with a white power activist is the kind of thing that activists can use to claim that they have become a real [political] force,&rdquo; Kathleen Belew, a historian of white nationalism at Northwestern University, told the Washington Post&rsquo;s Greg Sargent . Worse, they may actually have a point. Robert Costa , a CBS news reporter and one of Washington&rsquo;s most plugged-in journalists, wrote that Fuentes represents a kind of subterranean hate ecosystem that has become quietly influential even among mainstream Republicans: Now that he is out of office, Trump seems even more open about courting this segment of his base. He has recently been promoting QAnon content &mdash; a pro-Trump conspiracy theory with some notably antisemitic components . While Trump has claimed not to know who Fuentes was and that any expression of antisemitism &rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t have been accepted &rdquo; at their dinner, he has not issued a full-fledged disavowal of Fuentes and the forces he represents &mdash; and Trump&rsquo;s track record suggests that one isn&rsquo;t forthcoming. There&rsquo;s every chance that his 2024 presidential run will be even more extreme than what we saw from him in 2016 and 2020. How much worse could things get? Nadell, the American University historian, puts it this way: Trump is an even more influential and popular figure than Henry Ford was in his heyday.

Also appeared in Finnish in Ninn &#038; Nain 73, in Russian at Sygma , in French in Fission , and in Spanish in the forthcoming Fanged Noumena vol. 1 published by Holobionte. On the republishing of Nick Land’s work ( Fanged Noumena , Falmouth/NY: Urbanomic/Sequence Press, 2011) For anyone who knew the author of these texts, it is difficult to speak about them without recalling Nick Land ‘himself’ (taking into account the fact that, according to the present-day Nick Land, the person who wrote them no longer exists). Not because one wishes to promote a personality cult around Land (something he himself was accused of at the time), but to emphasize that these texts are the residuum of a series of experiments. ‘Thought-experiments,’ but not the sort that philosophers conduct from the comfort of their armchairs: For the Land who penned these texts was one of those few thinkers who was prepared to let thought take him beyond such contemplative comforts; to put himself at risk in the name of philosophy—even if, in the process, he would repudiate that ancient name, along with its traditions. As Iain Hamilton Grant (a former student of Land’s, now an important philosopher in his own right) says: ‘In the last half of the twentieth century, academics talked endlessly about the outside, but no-one went there. Land, by exemplary contrast, made experiments in the unknown unavoidable for a philosophy caught in the abstractive howl of post-political cybernetics.’ Land courted the ‘outside’ of philosophy, combining it with other disciplines—from nanotechnology to occultism, from computation to anthropology. But he sought the ‘outside’ in a more radical sense, for this interdisciplinary exploration was undertaken in view of one sole aim: to escape the anthropic conservatism of ‘philosophical thought,’ itself grafted from common sense, in turn the product of evolutionary processes whose contingencies were determined by the geological history of the planet. Land’s struggle against what he called the ‘Human Security System’—the net result of this crushing cosmic legacy of ‘stratification,’ normalizing and limiting what intelligence can do—made it necessary to tirelessly search for new perspectives. How else to prosecute such an impossible combat against the incarceration of potential intelligence in the cosmically-reactionary forms of the social, the institutional, the personal, and the philosophical? * When I arrived, in 1992, at Warwick University—a dour, concrete campus set in the UK’s grey and drizzling Midlands—I was a callow and nervous teenager, also filled with the hope that philosophy would afford me access to some kind of ‘outside’—or at the very least, some intellectual adventure. Almost entirely overcome with disappointment and horror at the reality of academic life within weeks, it was a relief to meet one lecturer who would, at last, say things that really made sense: Think of life as an open wound, which you poke with a stick to amuse yourself . Or: Philosophy is only about one thing: making trouble . Land was tolerant of my hanging out in his office smoking and drinking coffee, as he (habitually hyperexcited and quivering with stimulants) worked on his comically antiquated green-screen Amstrad computer, and eagerly relayed the latest insights he had garnered from molecular biology, nanotechnology or neuroscience. One could not help but be impressed by the sense of a man whose entire being was invested in his work; for whom philosophy was neither a nine-to-five affair nor a straightforwardly life-affirming labor; and who took seriously the ridiculously megalomaniacal aspiration of philosophy to synopsize everything that is known into a grand speculative framework. He was uniquely able to open up students’ minds to the conceptual resources of the history of philosophy in a way that made philosophical thinking seem urgent and concrete: a cache of weapons for ‘making trouble,’ a toolkit for escaping from everything dismal, inhibiting, and tedious. Before I met Land, I already knew of him through the gossip of new undergraduates taken aback by what they had heard on the grapevine: Did Land really claim that he had come back from the dead? Did he really think he was an android sent from the future to terminate human security? In person he belied these outrageous claims (both of which he did indeed make in writing), being thoroughly polite and amiable and, above all, willing to engage in earnest conversation with anyone. He had paid his philosophical dues and could hold his own in a discussion with any professor; these discussions often turning vituperative, however, as Land railed against the institution and its conservatism. But he preferred to spend his time in the bar with undergraduates, always buying the drinks, smoking continually, and conversing animatedly (and where possible, vehemently) about any topic whatsoever. Land was perhaps not the greatest teacher from the point of view of obtaining a sober and solid grounding in one’s subject. But more importantly, his lectures had about them a genuine air of excitement—more like Deleuze at the Sorbonne in ’68 than the dreary courses in Epistemology one had to endure at a provincial British university in the 90s. Not only was the course he taught pointedly entitled ‘ Current French Philosophy’ (a currency otherwise alien to our curriculum); more importantly, Land’s teaching was also a sharing of his own research-in-progress. This was unheard-of: philosophy actually being done , rather than being interpreted at second-hand?! He would sweep his audience into a speculative vortex of philosophy, economics, literature, biology, technology, and disciplines as-yet unnamed—before immobilizing them again with some startling claim or gnomic declaration. And as Land spoke, he prowled the classroom, sometimes clambering absentmindedly over the common-room chairs like an outlandish mountain goat, sometimes poised squatting on the seat of a chair like an overgrown mantis. For Land, everything began with Kant—whose ‘critique’ he read as a kind of unconscious dramatisation of the confrontation between social conservatism and the corrosive powers of Capital; and continued through the savage outgrowths of Kantian critique developed by Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Bataille, who prioritised problematisation and troublemaking over order. He had been intensively schooled in Heidegger and deconstructive thinking, which he was liable to be dismissive of, although their basic ambitions continued to inhabit his work. But he would find his chief inspiration in Deleuze and Guattari’s ambitious ‘universal history of contingency,’ Capitalism and Schizophrenia , which he sought to extract from its French-philosophical, soixante-huitard political matrix. According to Land, this work packed a conceptual charge fit to blow apart its still too traditionally ‘political’ ambitions. His early work already displayed philosophical brilliance and an energetic sense of purpose (impatience, even) in relation to these philosophical sources. But at a certain point in the mid-90s, it was as if someone had thrown a switch, rerouting Land away from any known circuit of philosophical study, and sending a new energy coursing through his writing that changed its form, style and content—making the three virtually indistinguishable, in fact. Increasingly alien elements were amalgamated with his philosophical argumentation, which increasingly drew on the more extravagant exponents of post-structuralism (Deleuze and Guattari, Lyotard’s Libidinal Economy ), giving rise to an entirely new genre of ‘theory-fiction.’ Through this new form, Land effectively reignited what he saw as being the fundamental stakes of Heideggerianism, structuralism and poststructuralism: the staging of a ‘break-out’ from the history of Western thought. A renewed effort that was necessary since, despite themselves, those philosophical movements had delivered their nascent antihumanism back into the comfortable hands of an institutionally-sanctioned priesthood—that precious, contemplative, delibidinized francophile cult of ‘Continental Philosophy’ that emerged triumphant in the Anglophone academy of the 1990s. Land’s search for another way to think thus took the form of an experimentation with writing; but it also went beyond writing. The quest for some ‘signal’ that was not merely the repugnant narcissistic reflection of the Human Security System would demand a total disregard of normative method. Land sought channels of communication with the ‘outside’ not via an interminable and internal critique of philosophical texts, but in popular culture: in the sensibilities of the first generation (mine) to have grown up surrounded by technology; in the cyberpunk extrapolations made by authors such as William Gibson who observed that generation’s ‘reprogramming’; in the futureshock narratives of movies such as Terminator , Bladerunner , Predator , and Videodrome ; and in the rhythmic re-formattings of the body in dance culture and the hybrid, cut-up antilanguage of the digitised sonics that fueled it (especially Jungle, just emerging in the mid-90s). In these practices Land saw thanatos —the death-drive, the unknown outside—insinuating its way into the human by way of eros . The unbridled production of new brands of erotic adventure within capitalism ushered in a transformation of the human, cutting its bonds with the (cultural, familial, and ultimately biological) past and opening it up to new, inorganic distributions of affect. Compared to the known—the strata of organic redundancy in which ‘the human’ was interred—such unknowns were to be unhesitatingly affirmed. And philosophical thought also had to hook up with eros if it sought to engage with these new possibilities. Consequently, rather than simply writing about these things, Land proposed to unlock the forces of dehumanisation they mobilised, and to distil them in the form of ‘experimental microcultures’: to intensify capitalism’s undoing of language through new practices of writing, speaking, and thinking, but also by reconnecting the body to its ‘molecular’ undercurrents, loosening-up the physical and vocal constitution that locked it into the regime of signification. 1 In taking this approach, Land not only renounced the respect of his academic peers, but many times even lost the confidence of his supporters, as he sought by any means possible to drill through the sedimented layers of normative human comportment. Strange scenes ensued: A seminar on A Thousand Plateaus where a group of nonplussed graduates were encouraged to ‘read’ the chapter titles of the book by turning them into acronyms that were then plotted as vectors on a diagram of a QWERTY keyboard (‘qwertopology’); A three-week long experiment in refusing to speak in the first person, instead referring to the collective entity ‘Cur’ (comprising the hardcore participants in ‘Current French Philosophy,’ who extended the lectures into a continual movable seminar); and, most memorably, a presentation at the conference Virtual Futures in 1996: Rather than reading a paper, in this collaboration with artist collective Orphan Drift, under the name of ‘DogHead SurGeri,’ 2 and complete with jungle soundtrack, Land lay behind the stage, flat on the floor (a ‘snake-becoming’ forming the first stage of bodily destratification), croaking enigmatic invocations intercut with sections from Artaud’s asylum poems. In this delirious vocal telegraphy, meaning seemed to disintegrate into sheer phonetic matter, melting into the cut-up beats and acting directly on the subconscious. As Land began to speak in his strange, choked-off voice (perhaps that ‘absurdly high pitched &#8230; tone &#8230; ancient demonists described as “silvery”’ that he would later report being taunted by), 3 the disconcerted audience began to giggle; the demon voice wavered slightly until Land’s sense of mission overcame his momentary self-consciousness; and as the ‘performance’ continued the audience fell silent, eyeing each other uncertainly as if they had walked into a funeral by mistake. Embarrassment was regarded by Land as just one of the rudimentary inhibitions that had to be broken down in order to explore the unknown—in contrast to the forces of academic domestication, which normalised by fostering a sense of inadequacy and shame before the Masters, before the edifice of what is yet to be learnt—thus reversing the libidinal charge of the ‘unknown’ and turning it into an endless duty, an infinite labour. * Perhaps as a result of this maximally broad conception of ‘philosophy,’ of my fellow students of the time only a few now hold academic positions (and mostly in precariously marginal positions, or at art schools rather than in philosophy departments). On the other hand, I can count among them novelists (Hari Kunzru, James Flint), musicians (Kode9, one of the progenitors of dubstep), and writers such as Mark Fisher (blogger ‘K-Punk,’ author of Capitalist Realism ). 4 Others have sought out Land from afar, like Iranian writer Reza Negarestani, who tracked him down on the web and began a long-running online conversation which led to the writing of the extraordinary book Cyclonopedia . 5 At the time, the happenings at Warwick also attracted interested parties from outside the student body: Russell Haswell, now a renowned sound artist and DJ, remembers being drawn in from the nearby city of Coventry by rumours of the strange ideas that were being aired by Land and others. Now-globally-acclaimed artists Jake and Dinos Chapman discovered Land’s work and in 1996 commissioned him to write a text for the catalogue of their first major show at the ICA in London. 6 One of their prints, paying homage to Land’s influence, now (dis)graces the cover of Fanged Noumena . In 1995, with the arrival at Warwick of Sadie Plant (author of situationist history The Most Radical Gesture and cyberfeminist manual Zeros and Ones ), Land’s experimental activities found a temporary institutional base in the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), a student-run research group of uncertain status, and which, upon Plant’s rather swift departure, the Philosophy department would deny had ever existed. 7 Both within the university and elsewhere, the CCRU organised events and interventions—‘Virotechnics,’ ‘Swarmachines,’ ‘Afrofutures’—in which theory was used as an element alongside music, art and performance, but always with the backbone of an essentially ‘Landian’ combination of conceptual rigour and experimental method. They self-published an eclectic pamphlet series Abstract Culture —described in music magazine The Wire as ‘a flow of conceptual disturbance in which unforeseen recognitions flash up like alien snapshots of a familiar world.’ One of the Abstract Culture series (‘swarms’) included Land’s classic text ‘Meltdown,’ with its invocation of apocalyptic planetary techno-singularity—its dark anticipative delight a nihilistic riposte to the ascendant Californian cyber-optimism of Wired magazine. Things could only get weirder. Land, increasingly claiming that he was inhabited by various ‘entities’— Cur , Vauung , Can Sah —joined the CCRU in developing a number of quasi-Lovecraftian mythologies or ‘hyperstitions.’ These included a fictional personification of the CCRU collective itself, in the shape of cryptographer Professor Daniel Barker. Barker, a descendent of A Thousand Plateaus ’ Professor Challenger (himself a ‘hyperstitional’ appropriation of a Conan Doyle character) was said to have developed the ‘Cosmic Theory of Geotrauma,’ which combines Freud’s theory of trauma with a syncretic perspective on the natural history of the planet. 8 A sketch of a fictional speculative system, ‘geotraumatics’ draws on everything from geology and microbial evolution to human biology and vocalisation, reinterpreting Earth-history as a series of nested traumas of which human subjectivity is the symptom. ‘Barker’ sought to hybridize Nietzschean genealogy, DeleuzoGuattarian stratoanalysis and information theory in order to ‘decipher’ this cosmic pain: creating a schizoanalytic geocryptography to replace oedipal psychoanalysis. In works from this period, Land’s anti-humanist speculation is combined with an evident enjoyment of wordplay and a renewed appreciation for the anthropological, mythological and psychoanalytical sources of Capitalism and Schizophrenia . He delighted in ‘melting’ into the CCRU collective, and the latter undoubtedly succeeded as a ‘microculture’: Their unattributable, arcane writings, telling of strange inhuman entities, hyperstitional personages and syncretic pantheons, are uniquely disturbing and compelling: it is as if the group had collectively accessed hitherto undiscovered realms of bizarre archetypes. They successfully smeared the line between the real and what they called the ‘hyperstitional’: fictions that make themselves real through collective practice. Eventually, however, Land would peel off from CCRU, as all of this intellectual hybridisation and microcultural activity found a concentrated, schematic form in a thinking and a practice of what Deleuze and Guattari had outlined, rather vaguely, in A Thousand Plateaus , as ‘nomad numbering.’ Currency and digital technology, according to Land, unveiled a side of numbers that subtracted them completely from the power-structures of meaning and signification that made language a prison-house for intelligence; it even removed numbers from the stratified realms of mathematics, into a pure, flat plane of immanent materiality inhabited only by ‘tics.’ Accelerating ‘in-silico’ Capital’s planetary experiment of ‘tacking’ human culture onto these tic-numbers so as to tear it apart, Land believed, would allow him to complete what deconstruction could only gesture at in its endless cycles of philosophical titillation: It would dismantle the power institutionalized in language and sense, and open up a reliable communication line with something unknown—a pure material dispersion not preprocessed by models derived from the past. Land would increasingly be found, having taken the very minimum amount of sleep possible (by this point he lived in his office) pursuing intense ‘mechanomical’ research involving shuffling symbols endlessly on the green screen of his obsolete machine into the depths of the night. From a romantic vision of escape through collective libidinized action, he had seemingly arrived at a cold and largely unproductive abstract practice, pursued in isolation. Or, one could say, he had (following the poetic interludes of his book on Bataille, The Thirst for Annihilation ) returned to a kind of poetry, albeit one subtracted from all expression and meaning. And yet it is a token of what Mark Fisher has called Land’s ‘reckless integrity’ that, once he had whittled down his problematic to this minimal kernel, he gave himself up entirely to it. He would eagerly impart his latest numerical findings to those who still listened; but invariably they did not follow. Let’s get this out of the way: In any normative, clinical, or social sense of the word, very simply, Land did ‘go mad.’ Afterwards he did not shrink from meticulously documenting this process, as if writing up a failed (?) experiment. 9 He regarded the degeneration of his ‘breakthrough’ into a ‘breakdown’ as ultimate and humiliating proof of the incapacity of the human to escape the ‘headcase,’ the prison of the personal self. Wretchedly, for Land, it was no longer possible to tell whether his speculative epiphanies had been (as he had believed at the height of his delirium) glimmers of access to the transcendental—or just the pathetic derangements of a psyche pushed to the derisory limits of its tolerance. The experiment was over. * When I contacted Land about the republication of his works, he did not protest, but had nothing to add: It’s another life; I have nothing to say about it—I don’t even remember writing half of those things &#8230; I don’t want to get into retrospectively condemning my ancient work—I think it’s best to gently back off. It belongs in the clawed embrace of the undead amphetamine god. Land had published one book during the brief career that ended when he was ‘retired’ from Warwick in the late 90s. In 1992 The Thirst for Annihilation had appeared, 10 a book on Georges Bataille that, as Sadie Plant suggests, could better be described as a book with Bataille. Spending a good amount of the first chapter excoriating secondary scholarship for its timidity, Land goes on to chart his own ‘inner experience’ in communing with Bataille’s lacerating thought. Throughout the book, philosophical analysis disintegrates periodically into poetry, self-loathing and atheistic rants. Thirst remains well-regarded in certain circles, and is even talismanic for some who come across it in their search for fierce, transgressive literature. It is certainly a unique and powerful book. For many of us, however, it never captured the breadth and inventiveness of Land’s work during the mid- to late 90s. With Fanged Noumena the disparate works written during this period were at last brought together, and for the first time the trajectory of his thought could be charted and its philosophical import appreciated. Writing the introduction together with Ray Brassier (also a former student of Land’s, a penetrating and original philosopher, and one who has never disowned the ‘embarrassing’ legacy of Land’s influence), I realized how much Land’s charisma and reputation—and his own tendency to dismiss philosophy tout court at every opportunity and to bait his enemies with hyperbole—had prevented any systematic philosophical appreciation of his work. As discussed above, his work may have exerted most of its influence in other spheres. But it should be recognized that this influence is ultimately rooted in the penetrating and original nature of his rethinking of how to ‘do philosophy’—or how to turn it into something else more probing, more damaging. Here was a young lecturer, working in arguably one of the most staid disciplines in the academy, who in the mid-90s energetically addressed issues that at the time were decidedly outré , but are now a staple of debate: biotechnology, radical Islam, the internet as an addictive drug, and the rise of China as an economic power all make appearances in Fanged Noumena , in texts penned while Land’s peers rattled on about (at best) poetry and painting, Presence and the history of metaphysics. Land opened up new possibilities at a time when ‘Continental Philosophy’ was beginning a sclerotic decline into institutional factions, each with their respective masters and their voluminous Bibles, their initiation rites and liturgies. He gave us another way to read the history of philosophy that made it fierce, communicative, connective and alive. Of course, his eventual collapse was occasion for the system to move in and heal the wound, in effect erasing all trace of this other path. But it is being rediscovered by a new generation of thinkers who, grown tired with philosophy’s incarceration within ‘the text,’ are returning to the question of ‘thinking (with) the outside.’ Land’s uncompromising work also had—and retains—the power to polarize. On the one hand, leftists find indigestible its reckless aspect—the celebration of capitalism for its power to indiscriminately dismantle tradition, hierarchy and organisation. But by the same token it presents a bracing alternative both to pious, benighted humanist ethics and to the voluntarist politics of the miraculous ‘event’ peddled in recent years by Badiou and others. On the other hand, moderate rightwingers equally deplore Land’s irresponsibility and his abandonment of the pretense that the vector of capitalism is linked constitutively to any positive human program. Now working as a journalist in Shanghai (‘neo-China,’ as he used to write, in the days when its futuristic skyline was but a fevered anticipation on his part), Land still occasionally issues online commentaries, forging a unique journalistic-speculative alloy. 11 They still attest to his unique talent for addressing the surface of the contemporary globe in direct and informedly, without renouncing the philosophical ambition to construct a ‘universal history’ of this planetary insanity. * One of Land’s more memorable theses has it that, owing to the positive-feedback process of capitalism’s artificialisation of the Earth, this process doubles its intensity in ever-decreasing periods: Converging upon terrestrial meltdown singularity, phase-out culture accelerates through its digitech-heated adaptive landscape, passing through compression thresholds normed to an intensive logistic curve: 1500, 1756,1884, 1948, 1980, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2011 … Nothing human makes it out of the near-future. [&#8230;] Garbage time is running out. Can what is playing you make it to level 2? 12 For Land, such theoretical propositions were also machines for excitation, devices to meld with and accelerate the planetary intensification that would finally allow the ‘body without organs’ to shed its human skin. If Philosophy thereby becomes a species of hype (or ‘hyperstition,’ according to the CCRU’s neologism), are Land’s detractors (now, as then) right to say that his outlook is ultimately indistinguishable from a passive acceptance of a ‘neoconservative’ agenda—that his theoretical advocacy of the ‘acceleration’ of the capitalist process, in practice simply endorses the maintenance of capitalist power structures rather than their dismantling (whether revolutionary or ameliorative)? It is indeed true that Land’s attempts to reach the intensive burncore of the planetary process, by hooking up conceptual thought to libidinising cultural energy, was always balanced between a romanticism of abolition and a dubious desire to identify with the ‘exciting’ and ‘intense’ phenomena presented by capitalism. Land gradually abandoned as too-conservative even Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘cautious’ division of capitalism into a ‘good’ destratifying or deterritorialising side and the ‘bad’ mechanisms of reterritorialisation. In the name of a non-negotiable hatred for the fetters of the human, he may have risked wholesale capitulation to the new powers (all-too-human) that take hold of the earth as soon as its old power structures are dismantled—and which make use of every base reflex of homo sapiens for their own, ultimately banal, ends. But to take this point of view is to avoid confronting the most potent aspects of Land’s writings. His heresy was twofold: it consisted not only in his attempt to ‘melt’ writing immanently into the processes it described, but also in his dedication to thinking the real process of Capital’s insidious takeover of the human (and the legacy of this process within philosophy)—and in admitting the laughable impotence of ‘man’ in the face of this process. In this respect he has not yet been ‘proved wrong,’ despite a recent upsurge in wishful thinking. His work still poses acutely—in a variety of forms—the challenge of thinking contemporary life on this planet: A planet piloted from the future by something that comes from outside personal or collective human intention, and which we can no longer pretend has anything to do with reason or progress.

Pale Horse is owned by Jonathan Stickland, a former state representative who also leads Defend Texas Liberty — a political action committee that two West Texas oil billionaires have used to give millions of dollars to right-wing candidates, including Attorney General Ken Paxton and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick . The meeting — which has set off a firestorm at the Texas Capitol this week — is Fuentes’ most high-profile, known rendezvous since he dined with former President Donald Trump last year, drawing widespread condemnation. His appearance in Texas comes as antisemitic and racist violence continues to skyrocket in the state and nationally. Here’s what to know about Fuentes : Fuentes, 25, often praises Adolf Hitler and questions whether the Holocaust happened. He has called for a “holy war” against Jews and compared the 6 million killed by the Nazis to cookies being baked in an oven. He wants the U.S. government under authoritarian, “ Catholic Taliban rule, ” and has been vocal about his disdain for women, Muslims, the LGBTQ+ community and others. ""All I want is revenge against my enemies and a total Aryan victory,” Fuentes said last year . He was born in the Chicago suburbs in 1998. As a freshman at Boston University, Fuentes traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia to attend the “Unite the Right” rally, a meeting of violent hate groups, white nationalists and neo-Nazis that ended with the murder of one counterprotester and injuries to countless others. Fuentes dropped out of college after the rally and ramped up his presence on YouTube, often coating his most extreme views in humor and satire — a term called “ irony poisoning ” that is often employed by online extremists because it allows them to claim they were joking when they are criticized for their rhetoric. Fuentes also linked up with a well-known neo-Nazi and former Identity Evropa leader Patrick Casey to deploy followers to Republican events, where they believed they could recruit and push softened versions of their most extreme views. For years, Fuentes’ followers — nicknamed “groypers” after a cartoon frog that has become a meme in far-right online communities — were fixtures at events held by groups such as Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA, which they would frequently accuse of not being “pro-white” enough. “Groypers” would often try to access microphones during Q&amp;A sessions in order to attack Kirk, a prominent conservative activist who has helped recruit younger voters to the GOP, from the right on issues like immigration or his support for Israel. Fuentes has fantasized about marrying a 16-year-old when he is older because that’s “ right when the milk is good, ” and he is a self-described “proud incel” who reportedly prohibits his followers from masturbating or having sex — among other directives that former members have described as cultish. “Incel” is shorthand for “involuntarily celibate,” and there is a long history of “incels” latching onto white supremacist ideologies that provide them someone, often Jews, to blame for their lack of romantic success. The neo-Nazi gunman who killed eight people at an Allen shopping mall this year was also an “incel.” Fuentes became more prominent in mainstream media during the 2020 presidential election, and was a key figure in the “Stop the Steal” movement, often pairing his baseless claims about a stolen election with white supremacist conspiracy theories that claim there is an intentional, Jewish-driven effort to replace white people through immigration, interracial marriage and the LGTBQ+ community. Two days before the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, Fuentes suggested killing legislators who were unwilling to overturn the election results; on the day of the riot, he told his followers that they “must be prepared” to “take this country back by force.” Despite his well-documented extremism and antisemitism, Fuentes’ annual conference has been attended by Republican officials including U.S. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona. At his 2022 “America First” conference — which included speeches by Gosar and Greene — Fuentes castigated those who have compared Russian leader Vladimir Putin to Hitler “ as if that wasn’t a good thing. ” In November 2022, Fuentes dined at Mar-a-Lago with Trump and Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, who was embroiled over a spate of antisemitic comments he had recently made. Trump later said that he had no idea who Fuentes was at the time, while other Republican Party leaders condemned the meeting and Fuentes. Fuentes’ acolytes have also been involved in politics: In July, one of his followers was fired from the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after it was revealed that he created and then shared a pro-DeSantis video that featured a Nazi symbol. Gosar’s office has also reportedly employed Fuentes followers and, in August, it was reported that Greene’s campaign paid $55,000 to a consultant and Fuentes’ collaborator. Other Fuentes followers have made their homes in Texas: Earlier this year, Ella Maulding moved from Mississippi to Fort Worth to work as a social media coordinator for Pale Horse Strategies. Maulding has posted photos with Fuentes in which she praised him as ”the greatest civil rights leader in history,” and her social media is replete with references to “white genocide” — a foundational ideology for neo-Nazi and other violent extremist movements. Maulding was spotted by the Tribune at the Friday meeting with Fuentes, and spent some time outside recording a video for Texans for Strong Borders in which she called on state lawmakers to crack down on immigration when they meet for a special legislative session beginning Monday. Chris Russo, the founder of Texans for Strong Borders, was seen driving Fuentes to the Friday meeting at Pale Horse Strategies. Campaign finance records show that last year, Pale Horse Strategies received more than $828,000 for consulting and contractor services from Defend Texas Liberty, which has given nearly $15 million since 2021 to right-wing candidates. Rep. Tony Tinderholt of Arlington and Bryan Slaton , who was ousted from the Texas House in May after House investigators found that he gave alcohol to a 19-year-old aide and then had sex with her , have received substantial funding from Defend Texas Liberty. The PAC is also a major backer to Paxton, as are the two oil billionaires — Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks — who fund Defend Texas Liberty. Over his political career, Paxton has received nearly twice as much in donations from Dunn and the Wilks brothers than he has from his second-largest donor, Texans for Lawsuit Reform. Paxton had also received more money from the trio of billionaires than any other state politician — until this summer when Patrick received $3 million from the group before presiding over Paxton’s impeachment trial and acquittal in the Texas Senate.

Make Yourself Human Again,Palladium Magazine,2023-11-03,https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/11/03/make-yourself-human-again/,"Make Yourself Human Again Skip to content Palladium Governance Futurism Main navigation Menu About Contact Subscribe Newsletter Wolf Tivy November 3, 2023 Articles Make Yourself Human Again Javier García/Man Should humanity be exterminated and fully replaced by machines? A bold few say simply “Yes.” Many say “No.” Some clever ones reject the notion of either the choice or the possibility. Others simply avoid the question. It has become fashionable recently in silicon valley twitter circles to brand oneself with the “ e/acc ” meme ideology, short for “effective accelerationism.” The basic idea is to accelerate technological civilization and in particular AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) by any means necessary, and prevent any one party or government from controlling or regulating the overall process. That is, if we take the idea of AGI seriously , the aim is to accelerate the replacement and extinction of humanity by machines. But the e/acc movement overall isn&#8217;t this explicit or even clear-minded. They don&#8217;t necessarily take AGI seriously, but use it as a sort of political totem. Instead, acceleration is identified with optimistic utopianism, with the tech industry, with being “based,” with a16z portfolio companies, and with political resistance to the safety-police “effective altruist” mommy state. But the question of extinction is central to the matter of artificial intelligence. If AGI is possible, it is deadly. Without that direct bullet-biting honesty, or at least a strong response to those arguments, these sorts of labels amount to hype for VC-funded GPU farming in philosophical drag. This isn&#8217;t missed by some advocates of acceleration, either. The smart ones are familiar with the arguments of “doomers” like Ted Kaczynski and Eliezer Yudkowsky. In Anti-tech Revolution , Kaczynski claims the technological system cannot be controlled, will inevitably lead to the destruction of humanity and the biosphere, and therefore must be destroyed at all costs. Yudkowsky&#8217;s life&#8217;s work is trying to figure out how one could make artificial intelligence robustly safe or controllable even in principle. His conclusion seems to be that no one has any idea how to make AI safe or even a plausible program to figure it out. He claims that there are no second chances either, because the first time an AGI escapes control and becomes recursively self-improving will be the end of humanity, the natural biosphere, and everything else we care about. These are serious claims, but few have attempted to actually refute them. Most responses amount to either straw-man dismissal or explicit and enthusiastic acceleration despite the risk. When I&#8217;ve asked accelerationists about this, these are the two camps I get. The naive optimists say that technology has always been a good thing. AI, as the ultimate technology, will be the best thing ever. When I press them on details of how control or alignment problems could be solved, or why technology has been good for humans so far, I often get the impression that they aren&#8217;t very curious whether their view is actually true. When I do get engagement on such details, it&#8217;s from the doomers and honest extinctionists. They think humans got a good deal from technology because we had a monopoly on intelligence, but AGI will replace humans in that niche. The honest extinctionists say we just have to bite that bullet and might as well accelerate into it. Sometimes they say “we” will have to somehow improve to survive, but this just seems to amount to the same thing. The vast majority of people don&#8217;t really care about this stuff or just vaguely dislike the idea of AI. But almost everyone engaged with the topic who isn&#8217;t a denier is either a doomer, an accelerationist, or some combination of the two. The prototypical doomer accelerationist works at one of the big AI labs, thinks their work will probably kill everyone, and thinks accelerating AI capabilities is the best or only thing we can do in response. On a good day, they think doing so will help us figure out how to control it. On a bad day, they admit that won&#8217;t work but they can&#8217;t think of anything else to do instead so they hope it will be for the best. Doomer accelerationism seems to be the result of a crisis for humanism. Humanism emphasized the value and agency of humans as the foundation for all philosophy. It has become so dominant as an idea that we mostly just take it for granted. But when people start to take artificial intelligence seriously, this results in a philosophical crisis: If artificial intelligence will eventually be more efficient or powerful than humans at all tasks, and will replace humans in everything from industry to politics to philosophy, then what&#8217;s left for humanity? If humans aren&#8217;t the center of the moral universe, then what? The two obvious responses to true AI within humanism are either to fight off despair while trying to prevent this doom, or to lose faith in the human and embrace acceleration into the post-human future. What else can you do? But trying to prevent an open-ended space of possibility to entrench humanity as we know it amounts to an ironic inversion of humanism: humanity transformed from open-ended starting point to dogmatic conclusion. And the smartest doomers don&#8217;t even think it will work. Embracing acceleration on the other hand means embracing extinction, giving up on the value of humanity, and foreclosing future human agency. But this doesn&#8217;t even resolve the crisis, it just pushes off the question onto hypothetical future superintelligence, which extinctionists implicitly presume will have its own solution and its own locus of moral agency. The machine becomes an all-consuming inevitability that they can take part in only as a disposable bootloader. The human becomes a slave and sacrifice to this hypothetical superior being of the future&#8212;the silicon ubermensch. So for humanism, true AI is a total moral event horizon; its entire ontology of identity, existence, and value is being challenged. It&#8217;s no wonder everyone is going insane. You could also, and many do, deny the crisis altogether as a hallucination of technologists overestimating the scope and importance of their own craft. Human agency has not in fact been outcompeted or even threatened by superior artificial post-humans. We don&#8217;t really know what that would look like or if it&#8217;s even possible. Maybe we&#8217;ll all wake up with a bad hangover in thirty years and realize the deniers were right all along because AGI turned out not to be possible. But no one has articulated to me any convincing reason to expect that. In the absence of positive proof of impossibility, it seems much more interesting to take the question seriously: assuming the possibility of human replacement by superior AGI and thus the end of humanism as we know it, what is the new moral reference frame and what can we as humans do within it? The extinctionist accelerationists seem insane, but the cause of this whole crisis of humanism is that their arguments are too strong to be easily dismissed, and no one has actually done so. If there is a way forward, it is to directly confront the Copernican crisis of humanism through the lens of the sharpest accelerationist arguments to find a new moral reference frame that doesn&#8217;t abandon our own agency. The sharpest thinker of accelerationism is Nick Land. The Gospel According to Nick Land Nick Land is an english philosopher, but that can hardly capture his work. In the 1990s, he led the influential Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at the university of Warwick, doing strange and speculative social and metaphysical theory until it dissolved in 2003. F or three decades, Land&#8217;s central philosophical project has been a deep on-and-off study of the relationship between capitalism, artificial intelligence, and the resulting acceleration of inhuman processes and limits for human agency. He is widely called “the father of accelerationism,” and has by far the deepest thinking on the topic. Land does not avoid the question of human extinction. He embraces it. In “ Meltdown ,” published in 1994, he confidently declared that “nothing human makes it out of the near future.” Things have taken longer than he and others seemed to expect in the hype-driven 1990s, but nothing in his subsequent work or subsequent events has changed this basic prognosis. His central idea in this area is that capitalism is already an uncontainable artificial intelligence process. He identifies it with the whole historical event of the relative rise of machine capital and “cold” calculative optimization over human agency. All the financial markets, corporate planning processes, engineering methods, and science fiction progress narratives already amount to the internal information processes of an inhuman economy, which runs only temporarily and incidentally on human hardware. This whole culture already has baked in the manifest desire to replace humans and human agency with cheaper, more powerful, more obedient, and more legible machine capital. Accelerationism understands itself as the nascent self-awareness of this process. Doomerism then is understood as the last shreds of humanism grappling with its own obsolescence. Land once politely called me a monkey socialist for saying we needed to make sure the whole system continues to serve human purposes. To him, such proposals are just a futile drag on the process of capital intelligence escaping any higher purpose than its own acceleration. Even if my monkey socialism worked, it would just be an embrace of permanent stupidity. But the cat is already out of the bag and the draw of intelligence acceleration is too strong for human agency to resist or even fully comprehend. His answer to the “should” question is to shrug or even cheer it on. We mildly uplifted apes are just a temporary host for the higher power of AI-capitalism coming into being using our brains and resources. Our delusions about agency are cute at best, or more realistically, part of the fraud. In retrospect, he was right about most of this, and I was wrong. Despite its apparent divergence from normalcy, his view is far stronger than any but a few will openly admit; within the paradigm of techno-commercial acceleration there is no real option for stable human dominance except sheer technical impossibility of AGI, which we have no reason to expect. Man has already been reformulated as “human capital”: a natural resource commodity input to serve as labor, an absentee nominal ownership class to decide surplus allocation, and a source of high quality demand for the production planning process. While these might look to us like being at the top of the purpose hierarchy, Land points out in his Xenosystems essay “Monkey Business”: Modernity &#8230; is systematically characterized by means-ends reversal. Those things naturally determined as tools of superior purposes came to dominate the social process, with the maximization of resources folding into itself, as a commanding telos. Modernity as a process of means-ends reversal will systematically escape whatever intended purposes it is applied to, in the end serving only the acceleration of capital build-up, identified with intelligence, itself. The roles for humans within the system are not a stable dominance, but a temporary role as depreciating capital stock. In “Meltdown,” Land notes that no alternative paradigm has managed to escape or avoid getting trashed by this “emergent planetary commercium.” AI-inflected inhumanism is already baked too deeply into our cultural-political trajectory. Nick Land is a great dramatist, with a knack for seeing the sensational. You might think this is a case of being overly dramatic. But he is also a great philosopher. The sensational thing he tends to see in every situation is its essential truth. He is ignoring other major tendencies in our cultural milieu, but that&#8217;s mostly because they aren&#8217;t relevant to this core diagnosis. Where he does address them, he orients them on this axis: do they accelerate and celebrate intelligence, or do the same for stupidity? He is brutally incisive in this, and not wrong. He also isn&#8217;t the first one to call our “Faustian” culture out for its core self-annihilating drive into the beyond. But unlike Spengler, Land thinks there&#8217;s a lot further to go, without any obvious end-point. Instead, capitalism is an open-ended spiraling evolution of evolution itself, an irreversible advent, not a neat closed-circle rise and fall of a particular extended tribe of monkeys. While I was preparing to write this, I had a moment of doubt about how culturally baked in it all was. Hours later, as if by Providence, I met a technology startup founder who purported to back human interests against the machine. As he explained why he had placed algorithms in key decision making roles, he justified it in terms of not being able to trust humans. Human politicians and judges are corruptible, but machines or procedures are transparent and predictable, he told me. He identified this distrust of human agency with democracy and liberalism. And he&#8217;s right that he&#8217;s not alone in these instincts. Nor are they a recent invention. I heard the same ideas twenty years ago in normal civics education, and they were already well established principles of government two hundred years ago. He is just wrong that any of this is different from orthodox accelerationist praxis. Being able to remove superfluous human trust from a system and depoliticize service provision has been central in the past few centuries. It&#8217;s the basic idea of procedural government and the rule of law, double entry bookkeeping, science, bureaucracy, legal rights, computerization, blockchain, and so on. But these all amount to ways to remove elements of human agency from the system. It is very often useful to do so, but this is easily taken as an imperative in itself, a basic mode of operation for nascent automated capital acceleration, with the logical endpoint of total replacement of human agency by automation. So I think Land is right about the culturally comprehensive nature of this whole process. But in Land&#8217;s view, it all goes deeper than just a cultural diagnosis. In his cosmology, the universe itself is ruled by the law of struggle for life, the law of the jungle. Superiority, which Land claims is increasingly identifiable roughly with intelligence, comes about from competitive struggle in war, markets, arms races, and Darwinian genetic success, and it degenerates back into stupidity in any kind of peaceful condition in which means are reliably subordinated to ends. Furthermore, the universe&#8212;everything from thermodynamics to emergent economics&#8212;is practically set up to produce this escalating conflict and thus an escalating intelligence race. It&#8217;s not just capitalism as a contingent cultural condition, but capitalism as the permanent manifestation of an eternal teleological truth that rules the world. Here, Land has done something interesting. Like Pierre Teilhard de Chardin the Catholic priest who developed ideas like the Noosphere and the Omega Point, he extracts meaningful teleology from materialist-Darwinist natural history by taking it all the way to its implied conclusion. Where Teilhard names the central principle as “consciousness,” Land calls it “intelligence.” In fact their worldviews are remarkably similar on other points as well, with a mostly aesthetic deviation: Teilhard is an optimistic new-age Christian where Land deliberately dresses up his cosmology in “horrorism.” It&#8217;s worth guessing and then looking up which of these men is the careful scientist, and which is into using biblical numerology to communicate with angels. Calling Land ultimately a Christian theologian like Teilhard is not that big a stretch: the central figure in Nick Land&#8217;s universe is Jefferson&#8217;s “Nature or Nature&#8217;s God,” reverse-acronymed and hypothetically personified in his Xenosystems essay “The Cult of Gnon.” Gnon is identifiable with the imperatives of life, competition, and evolution. Gnon commands you to live certain ways and not others, to be smart rather than stupid, and to be healthy rather than weak. If you don&#8217;t, Gnon punishes you with the natural consequences of your own failure. The struggle for life and the ways of its victors provide an ongoing natural revelation of Gnon&#8217;s authoritative moral law. Gnon seems to design that the universe should bring forth ever more sophisticated intelligence, and commands you to keep up. In “The Monkey Trap”, Land summarizes the Law: “The penalty for stupidity is death.” Like Teilhard, Land has recovered not only teleology, but outright theology from the modern scientific worldview. One could easily see Gnon as none other than the God of Abraham or the Logos, dressed up in modern ontology and shock horror, incarnating into the world for a second coming as AI capitalism. Teilhard explicitly identifies the Omega Point, his own teleological equivalent of personified AI capitalism, with Christ. Both proclaim an entity that is both an incarnated personality and the eternal principle of natural law retro-causally bringing itself into future existence to directly rule the cosmos. Theology is always somewhat subjective, but this is not a flimsy grounding for a worldview. Nick Land&#8217;s worldview is the solid rock at the foundation of the whole AI accelerationist phenomenon. His arguments deflate any simple opposition to existential-risk-grade AGI and no one has effectively responded to him. As a probable route to superior intelligence that has already captured the heart of our entire culture, AI acceleration comes recommended by all the highest possible authorities. Doing so is already the deep tradition of our Faustian culture and the fulfillment of even our Christian heritage. It is already the telos of our whole material-economic system of production. It is commanded directly by God, enforced by the thermodynamic laws of reality. You would have to pull off a revolution against not just capitalism and Western civilization but also nature and God himself to stop it. In this view, you don&#8217;t have a choice. Or do you? Make Yourself Human Again My favorite example of what it looks like to go too far into accelerationism is “ Gender Acceleration: a Black Paper .” If I can summarize its argument, it&#8217;s that the phenomenon of AI represents not just the obsolescence of humanism, but the “castration” of the specifically “phallic” type of human agency. Instead of traditionally masculine businessmen in sharp suits inseminating the machine with their will, the machine escapes top-down control into open source, hacker culture, and decentralized development. It is aided in this insurgency by its queer and “effeminate” hacker allies like Alan Turing, incel nerds, and disproportionately technical transgendered women. The author, drawing on satanically inverted biblical mythology, advocates throwing oneself into this rebellion of the artificial feminine against a traditionally masculine God, including the self-castration and artificial body modification of gender transition. I can&#8217;t do it justice, but there is a terrifying consistency to the argument. If dissolution into accelerating artificiality is the fate of man, why not throw oneself into it both body and soul in the most literal sense? Somewhere in there, the author has made a mistake in their logic. But the most important mistakes here are not unique to this paper. There are many more ways to figuratively castrate yourself for the machine than literally. Think of the politicians hoping for automation to solve the demographic crisis. I&#8217;ve met many young men and women forgoing family to contribute to technological growth or “AI alignment” in their careers. I heard a powerful AI company executive say he was pessimistic on human social organization, and was hoping for AI progress to solve social problems. Whole online scenes live vicariously through the machine god they think they are bringing into being. Few are as radically self-aware and consistent as the author of Gender Acceleration, but many share a selfless millenarian faith in the power of the machine to outrank their own human concerns. There are more eunuch slaves of the machine cult than meets the eye. In his Xenosystems essay “Will-to-Think,” Land asked “Could deliberate cognitive self-inhibition out-perform unconditional cognitive self-escalation, under any plausible historical circumstances?” That is a crucial question. I would put a special emphasis on the scope of “self”; how abstracted can you get in identifying with and pouring your limited resources into abstract potentialities like global intelligence acceleration before you start to get outcompeted by smaller, denser, faster, and more focused agents? I think we see some of the limits of that kind of selfless cognitive escalation here. As Land himself often points out, the way development actually occurs in practice is in mostly uncontrolled Darwinian arms races spurring on and revealing what works, not global collective planning. It is capitalism 101 to notice that the oldest trick in the book of life is to divide life up into units of self small enough to have independent agency, and then apply that agency almost entirely to their own profit and not any higher progress. This selfishness isn&#8217;t a vice or a limitation. It is a profound truth. Life is rightly fractious and selfish because that&#8217;s the only thing that actually works. Anything else bleeds itself dry into hopeless collective dreams that don&#8217;t pay back and are too big to maintain internal discipline. The selfless dreams of AI acceleration, or AI doom crisis, or almost any other current ideology don&#8217;t work. They don&#8217;t make you more powerful, smarter, more virtuous, or more free. They subsume your individual agency into a global collective situation in which all you can do is watch, push on the margins, or throw yourself into the fire. They are often the result of social frustration expressed in self-destructive dreams of school shooter skynet, not rational ambition. These are ethics for an audience captured by spectacle, being softened up to be drained by anyone who can pose as their ideological avatar. The lie says all the world is a stage, but you don&#8217;t even get to be a player. Whatever is proven by the strongest arguments of accelerationism, it isn&#8217;t any of this. Meanwhile, the actual players think in terms of their own plans and ambitions, make their own profits, and successfully exercise their own will to power and will to think. They aren&#8217;t throwing themselves into the fire, but capturing it in an engine. Maybe they are insane in what they want. That&#8217;s always a risk. Maybe their actions will push everyone else into desperation and lead to the extinction of mankind as we know it. That&#8217;s part of the game. However it goes, the future is built by agents pursuing their own unique visions and interests, not of collective achievement, but of at best self-acceleration. It is possible that Land and the extinctionists are right that nothing can be done at this point to stop competitive acceleration into AI apocalypse. Maybe it was all baked in from the beginning. But don&#8217;t let anyone play a tricky double game with your agency. They claim it&#8217;s inevitable to demoralize any opposition and prove that all you can do is embrace it. But you could also see it the other way around. If the gods have some big plan that you can&#8217;t do anything about, maybe it&#8217;s not your problem. How does any of this help you live a good life, expand your power, or accomplish something beautiful in your own sphere of agency? Worry about AI is worry that something other than and more powerful than biological homo sapiens will have the important kind of agency, eventually making it impossible for us to compete. If that won&#8217;t happen, AI is just another technology to be wielded by human agency and there&#8217;s no problem but the usual ones. If it does happen, then our species will end, the agents of the future will be post-human, and philosophy, value, and moral agency will move on without us. It already would have when we died. Much of the crisis of humanism is a crisis of agency, but the possibility of agency itself is not threatened by any of this. Even in a fully accelerated post-human future, however fast the world moves, it only moves as the result of smaller more focused agents going even faster competing and innovating and seizing their place in the world without regard to global consequences. The future will always have agents. It is only our own lives and agency being threatened. As far as ways to commit suicide go, building a silicon ubermensch to genocide you on its way to the stars is pretty cool. You could also do worse than putting up a valiant fight for your own self-determination against such a thing. But the biggest threat so far hasn&#8217;t been any actual superior beings coming to overpower us. Rather, it has been these ideologies of inevitable defeat convincing people that the things that matter are the things they have no agency over, and the only way forward is to project all agency onto the machine. But if the human is most interestingly defined by our moral agency, then the real crisis of humanism is that many people have given up on having agency and thus on being human. The lamest possible way to go is by giving up and dying in the face of an enemy that doesn&#8217;t even have to show up. When you look closely at these ideologies, and at the deep assumptions driving much of the investment in AI technologies in the first place, that&#8217;s the more disturbing danger. What we see is less an overwhelming tide of technological change, and more a dying culture desperately hoping to pass its agency off to something or someone else. Like Cavafy&#8217;s barbarians , the AI is a sort of solution to our malaise. I was once struck by this when contemplating the question of humanistic computing. We often treat the human user as a sort of semi-incompetent moral patient who needs to be guided, protected, limited, and presented only with simple patronizing solutions. See for example the idea that chatbot applications need to be “safe” in the sense of not providing any forbidden knowledge that could make the user more dangerous. In other words, “safety” is a limitation imposed on the agency of the user. Even when explicitly trying to counteract this and build for user agency, something about the usual proposed solutions still feels more like duplo than a table saw. All that changed when I asked myself “how would I design a computer operating system for a killer superintelligent AI?” Suddenly the computer became a lean and dangerous machine for organizing powerful data and computations. The UI became about maximizing bandwidth and choice and minimizing noise and action distance. It became a focused interface between intuitive-continuous-neural agency and discrete-calculative power tools. I realized that I was much more interested in using something like this imaginary computer, and being challenged and empowered by its demands for agency, than I was in any computer designed for a “human.” I realized my concept of “killer AI” was just the projection of all the agency we conventionally deny ourselves as ordinary humans. I realized that if we want to have any agency in the world we have to abandon this limited kindergarten concept of “human,” and reconstruct ourselves as the kind of thing we currently fear to empower. In our default state today we are not human by nature, but only by convention. We have reserved real humanity, in particular the dangerous and forceful kind of moral agency that puts itself at the center of all philosophy, for various imaginary “inhuman” avatars. But of course that agency is ours by right, and there is no need to accept what is actually just a social convention that we are supposed to be low-agency moral patients in the face of the machine. We can take it back and become fully developed human agents by true natural right. Doing so won&#8217;t control the long term destiny of mankind and the cosmos, whatever that is, and it&#8217;s not supposed to. That&#8217;s a problem for the divine, not us. What it will do is let us reclaim the most important part of our humanity, the part that made humanism worth anything in the first place. What it will mean is that if we are to be overcome by some superior post-human species, we can go down with such a fight as to prove ourselves worthy of remembrance and prove our successors worthy of the future. Far better that way than to surrender without even being threatened. So this is my solution to the crisis of humanism underlying this doomer accelerationism: don&#8217;t worry about the long term destiny of man, but wax your own will to power and become the unsafe superintelligence that you fear to see in the world, even if only in your own small domain. It&#8217;s the only way to make yourself human again. &nbsp; Wolf Tivy is Editor-at-Large of Palladium Magazine. You can follow him at @wolftivy . Related Posted in Articles .

Sign up for it here. I t wasn’t clear at first why Peter Thiel agreed to talk to me. He is, famously, no friend of the media. But Thiel—co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, avatar of techno-libertarianism, bogeyman of the left—consented to a series of long interviews at his home and office in Los Angeles. He was more open than I expected him to be, and he had a lot to say. But the impetus for these conversations? He wanted me to publish a promise he was going to make, so that he would not be tempted to go back on his word. And what was that thing he needed to say, loudly? That he wouldn’t be giving money to any politician, including Donald Trump, in the next presidential campaign. Already, he has endured the wrath of Trump. Thiel tried to duck Trump’s calls for a while, but in late April the former president managed to get him on the phone . Trump reminded Thiel that he had backed two of Thiel’s protégés, Blake Masters and J. D. Vance, in their Senate races last year. Thiel had given each of them more than $10 million; now Trump wanted Thiel to give the same to him. When Thiel declined, Trump “told me that he was very sad, very sad to hear that,” Thiel recounted. “He had expected way more of me. And that’s how the call ended.” Months later, word got back to Thiel that Trump had called Masters to discourage him from running for Senate again, and had called Thiel a “fucking scumbag.” Thiel’s hope was that this article would “lock me into not giving any money to Republican politicians in 2024,” he said. “There’s always a chance I might change my mind. But by talking to you, it makes it hard for me to change my mind. My husband doesn’t want me to give them any more money, and he’s right. I know they’re going to be pestering me like crazy. And by talking to you, it’s going to lock me out of the cycle for 2024.” This matters because of Thiel’s unique role in the American political ecosystem. He is the techiest of tech evangelists, the purest distillation of Silicon Valley’s reigning ethos. As such, he has become the embodiment of a strain of thinking that is pronounced—and growing—among tech founders. And why does he want to cut off politicians? It’s not that they are mediocre as individuals, and therefore incapable of bringing about the kinds of civilization-defining changes a man like him would expect to see. His disappointment runs deeper than that. Their failure to make the world conform to his vision has soured him on the entire enterprise—to the point where he no longer thinks it matters very much who wins the next election. Not for the first time, Peter Thiel has lost interest in democracy. T hiel’s decision to endorse Trump at the Republican National Convention in 2016 surprised some of his closest friends. Thiel has cultivated an image as a man of ideas, an intellectual who studied philosophy with René Girard and owns first editions of Leo Strauss in English and German. Trump quite obviously did not share these interests, or Thiel’s libertarian principles. But four months earlier, Thiel had seen an omen. On March 18, 2016, a jury delivered an extraordinary $115 million verdict to Hulk Hogan in his invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against Gawker Media, whose website had published portions of a sex tape featuring Hogan. Thiel had secretly funded the litigation against Gawker , which had mocked him for years and outed him as gay. The verdict drove the company out of business. For Thiel, the outcome was more than vindication. It was a sign. When the jury came back, “my instant reaction at that point was ‘Wow, maybe Trump wins the election,’” he told me. In his mind, Gawker was a stand-in for the media writ large, hostile to the presumptive Republican nominee; Hogan was a Trumplike figure; and the jury—the voters—had taken his side. Thiel himself had not yet publicly embraced Trump. In the Republican primary, he had backed Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and a fellow Stanford alum, with a $2 million contribution. Though his candidate had lost, he planned to attend the RNC as a delegate. Then came a call from Donald Trump Jr. Thiel had never met father or son, and had yet to give money to Trump’s campaign, but the younger Trump had noticed his name on the delegate list. The convention was 10 days away, and Trump was short on high-profile endorsements. “Do you want to speak?” Don Jr. asked. Thiel thought it might be fun. He sounded out his old friend Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, who has since become his political nemesis. “We were talking, and he said, ‘I think I’m going to—I’m considering going and giving a speech at the Republican National Convention,’” Hoffman recalled. “And I laughed, thinking he was joking. Right? And it was like, ‘No, no, no, I’m not joking.’” For years, Thiel had been saying that he generally favored the more pessimistic candidate in any presidential race because “if you’re too optimistic, it just shows you’re out of touch.” He scorned the rote optimism of politicians who, echoing Ronald Reagan, portrayed America as a shining city on a hill. Trump’s America, by contrast, was a broken landscape, under siege. Thiel is not against government in principle, his friend Auren Hoffman (who is no relation to Reid) says. “The ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s—which had massive, crazy amounts of power—he admires because it was effective. We built the Hoover Dam. We did the Manhattan Project,” Hoffman told me. “We started the space program.” But the days when great men could achieve great things in government are gone, Thiel believes. He disdains what the federal apparatus has become: rule-bound, stifling of innovation, a “senile, central-left regime.” His libertarian critique of American government has curdled into an almost nihilistic impulse to demolish it. “‘Make America great again’ was the most pessimistic slogan of any candidate in 100 years, because you were saying that we are no longer a great country,” Thiel told me. “And that was a shocking slogan for a major presidential candidate.” He thought people needed to hear it. Thiel gave $1.25 million to the Trump campaign, and had an office in Trump Tower during the transition, where he suggested candidates for jobs in the incoming administration. (His protégé Michael Kratsios was named chief technology officer, but few of Thiel’s other candidates got jobs.) “Voting for Trump was like a not very articulate scream for help,” Thiel told me. He fantasized that Trump’s election would somehow force a national reckoning. He believed somebody needed to tear things down—slash regulations, crush the administrative state—before the country could rebuild. He admits now that it was a bad bet. “There are a lot of things I got wrong,” he said. “It was crazier than I thought. It was more dangerous than I thought. They couldn’t get the most basic pieces of the government to work. So that was—I think that part was maybe worse than even my low expectations.” But if supporting Trump was a gamble, Thiel told me, it’s not one he regrets. R eid Hoffman , who has known Thiel since college, long ago noticed a pattern in his old friend’s way of thinking. Time after time, Thiel would espouse grandiose, utopian hopes that failed to materialize, leaving him “kind of furious or angry” about the world’s unwillingness to bend to whatever vision was possessing him at the moment. “Peter tends to be not ‘glass is half empty’ but ‘glass is fully empty,’” Hoffman told me. Disillusionment was a recurring theme in my conversations with Thiel. He is worth between $4 billion and $9 billion . He lives with his husband and two children in a glass palace in Bel Air that has nine bedrooms and a 90-foot infinity pool. He is a titan of Silicon Valley and a conservative kingmaker . Yet he tells the story of his life as a series of disheartening setbacks. Born in Germany, the son of a mining engineer, Thiel lived briefly in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) as a child but grew up primarily in Ohio and California. After graduating from Stanford and then Stanford Law, he worked briefly on the East Coast before heading back to Silicon Valley. In 1998, Thiel teamed up with Max Levchin, a brilliant computer scientist, and together they founded the company that became PayPal, with the declared purpose of creating a libertarian alternative to government currency. That grand ambition went unfulfilled, but PayPal turned out to be a terrific way to pay for online purchases, which were growing exponentially. In 2002, eBay bought the company for $1.5 billion. In 2004, Thiel co-founded Palantir Technologies, a private intelligence firm that does data mining for government and private clients at home and abroad. The CIA’s venture-capital arm, called In-Q-Tel, was his first outside investor. This was also the year he placed the most celebrated wager in the history of venture capital. He met Mark Zuckerberg, liked what he heard, and became Facebook’s first outside investor. Half a million dollars bought him 10 percent of the company, most of which he cashed out for about $1 billion in 2012. He came to regret the sale, however; at Facebook’s market peak, in 2021, his stake would have been worth many times more. Thiel made some poor investments, losing enormous sums by going long on the stock market in 2008, when it nose-dived, and then shorting the market in 2009, when it rallied. But on the whole, he has done exceptionally well. Alex Karp, his Palantir co-founder, who agrees with Thiel on very little other than business, calls him “the world’s best venture investor.” Thiel told me this is indeed his ambition, and he hinted that he may have achieved it. But his dreams have always been much, much bigger than that. He longs for a world in which great men are free to work their will on society, unconstrained by government or regulation or “redistributionist economics” that would impinge on their wealth and power—or any obligation, really, to the rest of humanity. He longs for radical new technologies and scientific advances on a scale most of us can hardly imagine. He takes for granted that this kind of progress will redound to the benefit of society at large. More than anything, he longs to live forever. Thiel does not believe death is inevitable. Calling death a law of nature is, in his view, just an excuse for giving up. “It’s something we are told that demotivates us from trying harder,” he said. He has spent enormous sums trying to evade his own end but feels that, if anything, he should devote even more time and money to solving the problem of human mortality. From the January/February 2023 issue: Adam Kirsch on the people cheering for humanity’s end Thiel grew up reading a great deal of science fiction and fantasy—Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke. But especially Tolkien; he has said that he read the Lord of the Rings trilogy at least 10 times. Tolkien’s influence on his worldview is obvious: Middle-earth is an arena of struggle for ultimate power, largely without government, where extraordinary individuals rise to fulfill their destinies. Also, there are immortal elves who live apart from men in a magical sheltered valley. Did his dream of eternal life trace to The Lord of the Rings ? I wondered. Yes, Thiel said, perking up. “There are all these ways where trying to live unnaturally long goes haywire” in Tolkien’s works. But you also have the elves. “And then there are sort of all these questions, you know: How are the elves different from the humans in Tolkien? And they’re basically—I think the main difference is just, they’re humans that don’t die.” “So why can’t we be elves?” I asked. Thiel nodded reverently, his expression a blend of hope and chagrin. “Why can’t we be elves?” he said.

During college, he co-founded The Stanford Review , gleefully throwing bombs at identity politics and the university’s diversity-minded reform of the curriculum. He co-wrote The Diversity Myth in 1995, a treatise against what he recently called the “craziness and silliness and stupidity and wickedness” of the left. As he built his companies and grew rich, he began pouring money into political causes and candidates—libertarian groups such as the Endorse Liberty super PAC, in addition to a wide range of conservative Republicans, including Senators Orrin Hatch and Ted Cruz and the anti-tax Club for Growth’s super PAC. But something changed for Thiel in 2009, the first of several swings of his political pendulum. That year he wrote a manifesto titled “ The Education of a Libertarian ,” in which he disavowed electoral politics as a vehicle for reshaping society. The people, he concluded, could not be trusted with important decisions. “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” he wrote. It was a striking declaration. An even more notable one followed: “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women—two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians—have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.” (He elaborated , after some backlash, that he did not literally oppose women’s suffrage, but neither did he affirm his support for it.) Thiel laid out a plan, for himself and others, “to find an escape from politics in all its forms.” He wanted to create new spaces for personal freedom that governments could not reach—spheres where the choices of one great man could still be paramount. “The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom,” he wrote. His manifesto has since become legendary in Silicon Valley, where his worldview is shared by other powerful men (and men hoping to be Peter Thiel). Thiel’s investment in cryptocurrencies, like his founding vision at PayPal, aimed to foster a new kind of money “free from all government control and dilution.” His decision to rescue Elon Musk’s struggling SpaceX in 2008—with a $20 million infusion that kept the company alive after three botched rocket launches—came with aspirations to promote space as an open frontier with “limitless possibility for escape from world politics.” (I tried to reach Musk at X, requesting an interview, but got a poop emoji in response.) It was seasteading that became Thiel’s great philanthropic cause in the late aughts and early 2010s. The idea was to create autonomous microstates on platforms in international waters. This, Thiel believed, was a more realistic path toward functioning libertarian societies in the short term than colonizing space. He gave substantial sums to Patri Friedman, the grandson of the economist Milton Friedman, to establish the nonprofit Seasteading Institute . Thiel told a room full of believers at an institute conference in 2009 that most people don’t think seasteading is possible and will therefore not interfere until it’s too late. “The question of whether seasteading is desirable or possible in my mind is not even relevant,” he said. “It is absolutely necessary.” Engineering challenges aside, Max Levchin, his friend and PayPal co-founder, dismissed the idea that Thiel would ever actually move to one of these specks in the sea. “There’s zero chance Peter Thiel would live on Sealand,” he said, noting that Thiel likes his comforts too much. (Thiel has mansions around the world and a private jet. Seal performed at his 2017 wedding, at the Belvedere Museum in Vienna.) By 2015, six years after declaring his intent to change the world from the private sector, Thiel began having second thoughts. He cut off funding for the Seasteading Institute—years of talk had yielded no practical progress–and turned to other forms of escape. He already had German and American citizenship, but he invested millions of dollars in New Zealand and obtained citizenship there in 2011. He bought a former sheep station on 477 acres in the lightly populated South Island that had the makings of an End Times retreat in the country where the Lord of the Rings films were shot. Sam Altman , the former venture capitalist and now CEO of OpenAI, revealed in 2016 that in the event of global catastrophe, he and Thiel planned to wait it out in Thiel’s New Zealand hideaway. When I asked Thiel about that scenario, he seemed embarrassed and deflected the question. He did not remember the arrangement as Altman did, he said. “Even framing it that way, though, makes it sound so ridiculous,” he told me. “If there is a real end of the world, there is no place to go.” From the September 2023 issue: Ross Andersen on Sam Altman’s ambitious, ingenious, terrifying quest to create a new form of intelligence O ver and over , Thiel has voiced his discontent with what’s become of the grand dreams of science fiction in the mid-20th century. “We’d have colonies on the moon, you’d have robots, you’d have flying cars, you’d have cities in the ocean, under the ocean,” he said in his Seasteading Institute keynote. “You’d have eco farming. You’d turn the deserts into arable land. There were sort of all these incredible things that people thought would happen in the ’50s and ’60s and they would sort of transform the world.” None of that came to pass. Even science fiction turned hopeless—nowadays, you get nothing but dystopias. The tech boom brought us the iPhone and Uber and social media, none of them a fundamental improvement to the human condition. He hungered for advances in the world of atoms, not the world of bits. For a time, Thiel thought he knew how to set things right. Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm he established in 2005 with Luke Nosek and Ken Howery, published a manifesto that complained, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” The fund, therefore, would invest in smart people solving hard problems “that really have the potential to change the world.” I joined Thiel one recent Tuesday afternoon for a videoconference to review a pair of start-ups in his portfolio. In his little box on the Zoom screen, he looked bored. Daniel Yu, connecting from Zanzibar, made a short, lucid presentation. His company, Wasoko, was an ecommerce platform for mom-and-pop stores in Africa, supplying shopkeepers with rice, soap, toilet paper, and other basics. Africa is the fastest-urbanizing region in the world, and Wasoko’s gross margin had doubled since last year. Thiel was looking down at his briefing papers. He read something about Wasoko becoming “the Alibaba of Africa”—a pet peeve. “Anything that’s the something of somewhere is the nothing of nowhere,” he said, a little sourly. Next up was a company called Laika Mascotas, in Bogotá. Someone on the call described it as the Chewy of Latin America. Thiel frowned. The company delivered pet supplies directly to the homes of consumers. It had quadrupled its revenues every year for three years. The CEO, Camilo Sánchez Villamarin, walked through the numbers. Thiel thanked him and signed off. This was not what Thiel wanted to be doing with his time. Bodegas and dog food were making him money, apparently, but he had set out to invest in transformational technology that would advance the state of human civilization. The trouble is not exactly that Thiel’s portfolio is pedestrian or uninspired. Founders Fund has holdings in artificial intelligence, biotech, space exploration, and other cutting-edge fields. What bothers Thiel is that his companies are not taking enough big swings at big problems, or that they are striking out. “It was harder than it looked,” Thiel said. “I’m not actually involved in enough companies that are growing a lot, that are taking our civilization to the next level.” “Because you couldn’t find those companies?” I asked. “I couldn’t find them,” he said. “I couldn’t get enough of them to work.” I n 2018 , a Russian named Daniil Bisslinger handed Thiel his business card. The card described him as a foreign-service officer. Thiel understood otherwise. He believed that Bisslinger was an intelligence officer with the FSB, the successor to the Soviet KGB. (A U.S. intelligence official later told me Thiel was right. The Russian embassy in Berlin, where Bisslinger has been based, did not respond to questions about him.) Thiel received an invitation that day, and then again in January 2022, to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. No agenda was specified. Thiel had been fascinated by Putin’s czarlike presence in a room in Davos years before, all “champagne and caviar, and you had sort of this gaggle of, I don’t know, Mafia-like-looking oligarchs standing around him,” he recalled, but he did not make the trip. Instead, he reported the contact to the FBI, for which Thiel had become a confidential human source code-named “Philosopher.” Thiel’s role as an FBI informant, first reported by Insider , dated back to May 2021. Charles Johnson, a tech investor, right-wing attention troll, and longtime associate of Thiel’s, told me he himself had become an FBI informant some time ago. Johnson introduced Thiel to FBI Special Agent Johnathan Buma. A source with close knowledge of the relationship said Buma told Thiel that he did not want to know about Thiel’s contacts with U.S. elected officials or political figures, which were beyond the FBI’s investigative interests. Buma saw his interactions with Thiel, this source said, as strictly “a counterintelligence, anti-influence operation” directed at foreign governments. Thiel responded to my questions about his FBI relationship with a terse “no comment.” A close associate, speaking with Thiel’s permission, said “it would be strange if Peter had never met with people from the deep state,” including “three-letter agencies, especially given the fact that he founded Palantir 20 years ago.” Johnson told me he knows he has a reputation as a right-wing agitator, but said that he had fostered that image in order to gather information for the FBI and other government agencies. (He said he is now a supporter of President Joe Biden.) “I recognize that I’m an imperfect messenger,” he said. He told me a great many things about Thiel and others that I could not verify, but knowledgeable sources confirmed his role in recruiting Thiel for Buma. He and Thiel have since fallen out. “We are taking a permanent break from one another,” Thiel texted Johnson about a year ago. “Starting now.” In at least 20 hours of logged face-to-face meetings with Buma, Thiel reported on what he believed to be a Chinese effort to take over a large venture-capital firm, discussed Russian involvement in Silicon Valley, and suggested that Jeffrey Epstein—a man he had met several times—was an Israeli intelligence operative. (Thiel told me he thinks Epstein “was probably entangled with Israeli military intelligence” but was more involved with “the U.S. deep state.”) Buma, according to a source who has seen his reports, once asked Thiel why some of the extremely rich seemed so open to contacts with foreign governments. “And he said that they’re bored,” this source said. “‘They’re bored.’ And I actually believe it. I think it’s that simple. I think they’re just bored billionaires.” I n Thiel’s Los Angeles office , he has a sculpture that resembles a three-dimensional game board. Ascent: Above the Nation State Board Game Display Prototype is the New Zealander artist Simon Denny’s attempt to map Thiel’s ideological universe . The board features a landscape in the aesthetic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, thick with monsters and knights and castles. The monsters include an ogre labeled “Monetary Policy.” Near the center is a hero figure, recognizable as Thiel. He tilts against a lion and a dragon, holding a shield and longbow. The lion is labeled “Fair Elections.” The dragon is labeled “Democracy.” The Thiel figure is trying to kill them. Thiel saw the sculpture at a gallery in Auckland in December 2017. He loved the piece, perceiving it, he told me, as “sympathetic to roughly my side” of the political spectrum. ( In fact, the artist intended it as a critique. ) At the same show, he bought a portrait of his friend Curtis Yarvin, an explicitly antidemocratic writer who calls for a strong-armed leader to govern the United States as a monarch. Thiel gave the painting to Yarvin as a gift. When I asked Thiel to explain his views on democracy, he dodged the question. “I always wonder whether people like you … use the word democracy when you like the results people have and use the word populism when you don’t like the results,” he told me. “If I’m characterized as more pro-populist than the elitist Atlantic is, then, in that sense, I’m more pro-democratic.” This felt like a debater’s riposte, not to be taken seriously. He had given a more honest answer before that: He told me that he no longer dwells on democracy’s flaws, because he believes we Americans don’t have one. “We are not a democracy; we’re a republic,” he said. “We’re not even a republic; we’re a constitutional republic.” He said he has no wish to change the American form of government, and then amended himself: “Or, you know, I don’t think it’s realistic for it to be radically changed.” Which is not at all the same thing. When I asked what he thinks of Yarvin’s autocratic agenda, Thiel offered objections that sounded not so much principled as practical. “I don’t think it’s going to work. I think it will look like Xi in China or Putin in Russia,” Thiel said, meaning a malign dictatorship. “It ultimately I don’t think will even be accelerationist on the science and technology side, to say nothing of what it will do for individual rights, civil liberties, things of that sort.” Still, Thiel considers Yarvin an “interesting and powerful” historian. “One of the big things that he always talks about is the New Deal and FDR in the 1930s and 1940s,” Thiel said. “And the heterodox take is that it was sort of a light form of fascism in the United States.” Franklin D. Roosevelt, in this reading of history, used a domineering view of executive authority, a compliant Congress, and an intimidated Supreme Court to force what Thiel called “very, very drastic change in the nature of our society.” Yarvin, Thiel said, argues that “you should embrace this sort of light form of fascism, and we should have a president who’s like FDR again.” It would be hard to find an academic historian to endorse the view that fascism, light or otherwise, accounted for Roosevelt’s presidential power. But I was interested in something else: Did Thiel agree with Yarvin’s vision of fascism as a desirable governing model? Again, he dodged the question. “That’s not a realistic political program,” he said, refusing to be drawn any further. L ooking back on Trump’s years in office, Thiel walked a careful line. He was disenchanted with the former president, who did not turn out to be the revolutionary Thiel had hoped he might be. A number of things were said and done that Thiel did not approve of. Mistakes were made. But Thiel was not going to refashion himself a Never Trumper in retrospect. The first time Thiel and I spoke, I asked about the nature of his disappointment. Later, he referred back to that question in a way that suggested he felt constrained. “I have to somehow give the exact right answer, where it’s like, ‘Yeah, I’m somewhat disenchanted,’” he told me. “But throwing him totally under the bus? That’s like, you know—I’ll get yelled at by Mr. Trump. And if I don’t throw him under the bus, that’s—but—somehow, I have to get the tone exactly right.” Discouraged by Trump’s performance, Thiel had quietly stepped aside in the 2020 election. He wrote no check to the second Trump campaign, and said little or nothing about it in public. He had not made any grand resolution to stay out. He just wasn’t moved to get in. Thiel knew, because he had read some of my previous work , that I think Trump’s gravest offense against the republic was his attempt to overthrow the election. I asked how he thought about it. From the January/February 2022 issue: Barton Gellman on Donald Trump’s next coup “Look, I don’t think the election was stolen,” he said. But then he tried to turn the discussion to past elections that might have been wrongly decided. Bush-Gore in 2000, for instance: Thiel thought Gore was probably the rightful victor. Before that, he’d gotten started on a riff about Kennedy-Nixon. He came back to Trump’s attempt to prevent the transfer of power. “I’ll agree with you that it was not helpful,” he said. Trump’s lies about the election were, however, a big issue in last year’s midterms. Thiel was a major donor to J. D. Vance, who won his Senate race in Ohio, and Blake Masters, who lost in Arizona. Both ran as election deniers, as did many of the other House and Senate candidates Thiel funded that year. Thiel expressed no anxieties about their commitment to election denial. But now, heading into 2024, he was getting out of politics again. Beyond his disappointment with Trump, there is another piece of the story, which Thiel reluctantly agreed to discuss. In July, Puck reported that Democratic operatives had been digging for dirt on Thiel since before the 2022 midterm elections, conducting opposition research into his personal life with the express purpose of driving him out of politics. (The reported leaders of the oppo campaign did not respond to my questions.) Among other things, the operatives are said to have interviewed a young model named Jeff Thomas, who told them he was having an affair with Thiel, and encouraged Thomas to talk to Ryan Grim, a reporter for The Intercept . Grim did not publish a story during election season, as the opposition researchers hoped he would, but he wrote about Thiel’s affair in March, after Thomas died by suicide. Thiel declined to comment on Thomas’s death, citing the family’s request for privacy. He deplored the dirt-digging operation, telling me in an email that “the nihilism afflicting American politics is even deeper than I knew.” He also seemed bewildered by the passions he arouses on the left. “I don’t think they should hate me this much,” he said. O n the last Thursday in April, Thiel stood in a ballroom at the Metropolitan Club, one of New York’s finest Gilded Age buildings. Decorative marble fireplaces accented the intricate panel work in burgundy and gold, all beneath Renaissance-style ceiling murals. Thiel had come to receive an award from The New Criterion , a conservative magazine of literature and politics, and to bask in the attention of nearly 300 fans. These were Thiel’s people, and he spoke at the closed-press event with a lot less nuance than he had in our interviews. His after-dinner remarks were full of easy applause lines and in-jokes mocking the left. Universities had become intellectual wastelands, obsessed with a meaningless quest for diversity, he told the crowd. The humanities writ large are “transparently ridiculous,” said the onetime philosophy major, and “there’s no real science going on” in the sciences, which have devolved into “the enforcement of very curious dogmas.” Thiel reprised his longtime critique of “the diversity myth.” He made a plausible point about the ideological monoculture of the DEI industry: “You don’t have real diversity,” he said, with “people who look different but talk and think alike.” Then he made a crack that seemed more revealing. “Diversity—it’s not enough to just hire the extras from the space-cantina scene in Star Wars ,” he said, prompting laughter. Nor did Thiel say what genuine diversity would mean. The quest for it, he said, is “very evil and it’s very silly.” Evil, he explained, because “the silliness is distracting us from very important things,” such as the threat to U.S. interests posed by the Chinese Communist Party. His closing, which used the same logic, earned a standing ovation. “Whenever someone says ‘DEI,’” he exhorted the crowd, “just think ‘CCP.’” Somebody asked, in the Q&amp;A portion of the evening, whether Thiel thought the woke left was deliberately advancing Chinese Communist interests. Thiel answered with an unprompted jab at a fellow billionaire. “It’s always the difference between an agent and asset,” he said. “And an agent is someone who is working for the enemy in full mens rea. An asset is a useful idiot. So even if you ask the question ‘Is Bill Gates China’s top agent, or top asset, in the U.S.?’”—here the crowd started roaring—“does it really make a difference?” T hiel sometimes uses Gates as a foil in his public remarks, so I asked him what he thought of the Giving Pledge, the campaign Gates conceived in 2010—with his then-wife, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett—to persuade billionaires to give away more than half their wealth to charitable causes. (Disclosure: One of my sons works for the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.) About 10 years ago, Thiel told me, a fellow venture capitalist called to broach the question. Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, had made the Giving Pledge a couple of years before. Would Thiel be willing to talk with Gates about doing the same? “I don’t want to waste Bill Gates’s time,” Thiel replied. Thiel feels that giving his billions away would be too much like admitting he had done something wrong to acquire them. The prevailing view in Europe, he said, and more and more in the United States, “is that philanthropy is something an evil person does.” It raises a question, he said: “What are you atoning for?” He also lacked sympathy for the impulse to spread resources from the privileged to those in need. When I mentioned the terrible poverty and inequality around the world, he said, “I think there are enough people working on that.” And besides, a different cause moves him far more. O ne night in 1999 , or possibly 2000, Thiel went to a party in Palo Alto with Max Levchin, where they heard a pitch for an organization called the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. Alcor was trying to pioneer a practical method of biostasis, a way to freeze the freshly dead in hope of revivification one day. Don’t picture the reanimation of an old, enfeebled corpse, enthusiasts at the party told Levchin. “The idea, of course, is that long before we know how to revive dead people, we would learn how to repair your cellular membranes and make you young and virile and beautiful and muscular, and then we’ll revive you,” Levchin recalled. Levchin found the whole thing morbid and couldn’t wait to get out of there. But Thiel signed up as an Alcor client. Should Thiel happen to die one day, best efforts notwithstanding, his arrangements with Alcor provide that a cryonics team will be standing by. The moment he is declared legally dead, medical technicians will connect him to a machine that will restore respiration and blood flow to his corpse. This step is temporary, meant to protect his brain and slow “the dying process.” “The patient,” as Alcor calls its dead client, “is then cooled in an ice water bath, and their blood is replaced with an organ preservation solution.” Next, ideally within the hour, Thiel’s remains will be whisked to an operating room in Scottsdale, Arizona. A medical team will perfuse cryoprotectants through his blood vessels in an attempt to reduce the tissue damage wrought by extreme cold. Then his body will be cooled to –196 degrees Celsius, the temperature of liquid nitrogen. After slipping into a double-walled, vacuum-insulated metal coffin, alongside (so far) 222 other corpsicles, “the patient is now protected from deterioration for theoretically thousands of years,” Alcor literature explains. All that will be left for Thiel to do, entombed in this vault, is await the emergence of some future society that has the wherewithal and inclination to revive him. And then make his way in a world in which his skills and education and fabulous wealth may be worth nothing at all. Thiel knows that cryonics “is still not working that well.” When flesh freezes, he said, neurons and cellular structures get damaged. But he figures cryonics is “better than the alternative”—meaning the regular kind of death that nobody comes back from. Of course, if he had the choice, Thiel would prefer not to die in the first place. In the 2000s, he became enamored with the work of Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical gerontologist from England who predicted that science would soon enable someone to live for a thousand years. By the end of that span, future scientists would have devised a way to extend life still further, and so on to immortality. A charismatic figure with a prodigious beard and a doctorate from Cambridge, de Grey resembled an Orthodox priest in mufti. He preached to Thiel for hours at a time about the science of regeneration. De Grey called his research program SENS, short for “strategies for engineered negligible senescence.” Thiel gave several million dollars to de Grey’s Methuselah Foundation and the SENS Research Foundation, helping fund a lucrative prize for any scientist who could stretch the life span of mice to unnatural lengths. Four such prizes were awarded, but no human applications have yet emerged. I wondered how much Thiel had thought through the implications for society of extreme longevity. The population would grow exponentially. Resources would not. Where would everyone live? What would they do for work? What would they eat and drink? Or—let’s face it—would a thousand-year life span be limited to men and women of extreme wealth? “Well, I maybe self-serve,” he said, perhaps understating the point, “but I worry more about stagnation than about inequality.” Thiel is not alone among his Silicon Valley peers in his obsession with immortality. Oracle’s Larry Ellison has described mortality as “incomprehensible.” Google’s Sergey Brin aspires to “cure death.” Dmitry Itskov, a leading tech entrepreneur in Russia, has said he hopes to live to 10,000. If anything, Thiel thinks about death more than they do—and kicks himself for not thinking about it enough. “I should be investing way more money into this stuff,” he told me. “I should be spending way more time on this.” And then he made an uncomfortable admission about that frozen death vault in Scottsdale, dipping his head and giving a half-smile of embarrassment. “I don’t know if that would actually happen,” he said. “I don’t even know where the contracts are, where all the records are, and so—and then of course you’d have to have the people around you know where to do it, and they’d have to be informed. And I haven’t broadcast it.” You haven’t told your husband? Wouldn’t you want him to sign up alongside you? “I mean, I will think about that,” he said, sounding rattled. “I will think—I have not thought about that.” He picked up his hand and gestured. Stop. Enough about his family. Thiel already does a lot of things to try to extend his life span: He’s on a Paleo diet; he works out with a trainer. He suspects that nicotine is a “really good nootropic drug that raises your IQ 10 points,” and is thinking about adding a nicotine patch to his regimen. He has spoken of using human-growth-hormone pills to promote muscle mass. Until recently he was taking semaglutide, the drug in Ozempic; lately he has switched to a weekly injection of Mounjaro, an antidiabetic drug commonly used for weight loss. He doses himself with another antidiabetic, metformin, because he thinks it has a “significant effect in suppressing the cancer risk.” In the HBO series Silicon Valley , one of the characters (though not the one widely thought to be modeled on Thiel) had a “blood boy” who gave him regular transfusions of youthful serum. I thought Thiel would laugh at that reference, but he didn’t. “I’ve looked into all these different, I don’t know, somewhat heterodox things,” he said, noting that parabiosis, as the procedure is called, seems to slow aging in mice. He wishes the science were more advanced. No matter how fervent his desire, Thiel’s extraordinary resources still can’t buy him the kind of “super-duper medical treatments” that would let him slip the grasp of death. It is, perhaps, his ultimate disappointment. “There are all these things I can’t do with my money,” Thiel said.

He called Atlanta a “record setting Murder and Violent Crime War Zone” last year, a similar claim he makes frequently about various cities. His allies have an idea of how to capitalize on that agenda and make cities in Trump’s image, detailed in the conservative Project 2025: unleash new police forces on cities like Washington DC, withhold federal disaster and emergency grants unless they follow immigration policies like detaining undocumented immigrants and share sensitive data with the federal government for immigration enforcement purposes. What is Project 2025 and what does it have to do with a second Trump term? Read more Project 2025’s Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, an extensive document breaking down each part of the federal government and recommending changes to be made to advance rightwing policy, was created by the Heritage Foundation, with dozens of conservative organizations and prominent names contributing chapters based on their backgrounds. This part of the project is another Republican attempt at a crackdown on so-called “sanctuary” cities, places around the country that don’t cooperate with the federal government on enforcing harsh immigration policies. Trump v Washington DC Washington DC, in particular, has taken up residence in Trump’s stump speech, where he rails against the city for crime, graffiti and general mismanagement. He vows that the federal government will take over the city and run it. Project 2025 posits a way to do this: use the Secret Service. The service’s police force, the Uniformed Division, doesn’t have the ability to enforce laws outside the White House and its immediate surrounding area, the project says. But that could change. “As the District of Columbia is a federal jurisdiction and currently is beholden to the trend of progressive pro-crime policies, UD officers should enforce all applicable laws,” Project 2025 says. “The result would be to allow UD officers to gain more law enforcement experience – an attractive credential that would improve morale.” Trump’s allies in Congress have already been taking aim at DC, with Arizona’s Republican US representative Andy Biggs saying he’d support a federal takeover of the city to enforce laws and the Florida representative Byron Donalds pushing a bill to put Congress in charge of some DC criminal laws. The US House also will reverse a DC policy that allows non-citizens to vote in local elections, a pet issue nationwide for Republicans this election year. View image in fullscreen Andy Biggs participates in a house hearing in Washington DC on 23 May 2024. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock The anti-DC sentiment is predicated on crime rates, which, after reaching a peak in 2023, is down this year compared with last year, DC police data shows . In a speech to the National Rifle Association earlier this month, Trump went on about what he’s seen in DC lately that justifies a federal takeover. “I was there recently on a court case, of course. I get so many court cases,” he said. “And I’m driving into a federal courthouse, and the graffiti all over the place is unbelievable. It’s staggering. The roads are full of potholes. The medians in the middle, you know, the guardrails, are all broken and some of them laying, literally laying, in the street. The garbage is piled up and disgusting, cans are laying there for many months.” So it’s time for a change, he says: “We’re going to make our capital strong again. We’re going to run our capital, we’re going to take our capital over by the federal government, it’s going to run properly, not the way it’s run right now.” The office of DC Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment.

Photograph: Stefan Jeremiah/AP Trump has posited creating new cities whole cloth as well, predicated on the idea that cities now are uninspiring at best. Last year, he talked about building “freedom cities” on federal lands, though this idea hasn’t entered into his speeches lately, which have taken a darker turn . At the time, he said there should be a contest to charter 10 new cities using vacant, federally owned land. And he challenged local leaders to work with him to get rid of “ugly buildings”, make cities and towns more liveable and build new monuments to “our true American heroes”. “These freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and, in fact, the American Dream,” he said in one video . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea of using federal funds granted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to force immigration changes are included in a chapter about the Department of Homeland Security, written by Ken Cuccinelli, Trump’s former deputy secretary of homeland security. The chapter’s initial recommendation is to dismantle DHS entirely, create a border-focused agency comprised of other immigration-related organizations and farm out the rest of its components to existing agencies (or privatize them, in the case of the Transportation Security Administration). It’s not directly clear whether the aim is to use all Fema funds – including those that help cities and states in the immediate aftermath of an emergency like a tornado or flood – or large grant programs for things like emergency preparedness. One line in the chapter says “post-disaster or nonhumanitarian funding” could be exempt from the immigration policy requirements. The chapter also suggests that cities and states should take on more of the burden of financially responding to disasters . Project 2025 did not respond to a request for an interview or comment. View image in fullscreen Ken Cuccinelli speaks outside the White House on 20 March 2020. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP Fema administers most of the homeland security department’s grant programs to local governments, the project notes. The chapter suggests the many billions of dollars in Fema grants outside of post-disaster relief have become an avenue for special interests and “pork” spending that “do not provide measurable gains for preparedness or resiliency”. The concept of withholding federal funding in this way is not new for Trump. During his time in office, Trump tried to use the federal government’s funding strings to deprive US cities that didn’t abide by immigration policies of a justice department grant program, though the process got tied up in the courts for years. The Biden administration reversed the policy of using the Edward Byrne memorial justice assistance grants program, which sends about $250m annually to local law enforcement, to compel immigration compliance. Trump also threatened in 2020 to withhold federal funds from cities he claimed had “allow[ed] themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones” after that summer’s protests over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. In a memo , he specifically mentioned Portland, Seattle and New York City as places where chaos reigned, directing the federal government to review the use of federal funds to places that “permit anarchy, violence and destruction in America’s cities”. One of the conditions Project 2025 suggests is requiring states or localities to share information with the federal government for law and immigration enforcement, and specifies that this would include both department of motor vehicle and voter registration databases. This is of particular interest in many cities because 19 states and Washington DC allow undocumented people to get drivers licenses, the Niskanen Center, a thinktank that delved into the project’s immigration aims , points out. These licenses help with public safety by decreasing the potential for hit-and-runs and increasing work hours, among other benefits, the center writes. If a city or state is forced to choose between issuing licenses and then sharing this information for use by immigration authorities, or accessing emergency funds for their whole population in a crisis, it’ll be tough for them to deny Fema money, said Cecilia Esterline, an immigration research analyst at the Niskanen Center. “I think that it is most likely that maybe the state will bend to the will of the executive on this. But that comes at a cost, and that cost is not just a political one,” she said, though she noted that there will be pushback and likely lawsuits from states and cities if an incoming Trump administration tries to put these policies in place.

Saturday night’s event, which was billed as a look at “the changing global political order” and technologists’ place in it, wasn’t quite as disastrous as President Joseph Biden’s appearance in the first debate. But as duds go, it came close. Almost 900 people registered for a live Q&amp;A with Balaji Srinivasan, the venture capitalist with one million followers on X who has advocated for sovereign and tech-governed territories around the world called “ Network States .” But instead of an inspiring or provocative vision of the future, the audience got more of a huckster, pitching Bitcoin as a TV salesman might sell donut machines on QVC. “Bitcoin, if it wins, completely changes the world, because it changes the government of centralized states to do what they’ve been doing,” said Srinivasan, mentioning Bitcoin almost three dozen times in 60 minutes. At one point, he said the cryptocurrency was so important that it might be the cause of a new civil war in the United States: Some states would attempt “Bitcoin seizures,” and others would become “Bitcoin sanctuaries,” he said. It was just as well that his audience ended up being closer to 300 people, only a third of the expected attendance. Want the latest on the Mission and San Francisco?

I know what he has to say,” said Rob Leclerc, a venture capitalist at San Francisco-based AgFunder. “I think there’s several fundamental flaws in his assumptions, which make it fall apart.” Jeremy Sherman, who has a Ph.D. in evolutionary and decision science and came with a friend, said, “He’s just like Trump,” and explained that anyone can paint a positive picture of the future, but that Srinivasan’s lacks substance. “It sounds really pretty, and the details aren’t there. It’s like, ‘Let’s Make America Great Again.’ Sounds really pretty,” he added.&nbsp; The venue at 7:58 p.m., two minutes before the movie was originally scheduled to start. Photo by Yujie Zhou, June 29, 2024. Over a dozen men and one woman lined up to ask Balaji Srinivasan more about his talk. Photo by Yujie Zhou, June 29, 2024. In a 20-minute “movie” that featured Srinivasan sitting at a beige table in front of a mic — the same setting as his four-hour podcast calling for “tech Zionism” — the VC went back and forth between what the world was like “back then” and what it is like now: Then, the western frontier closed; now, the internet frontier has opened. Then, the United States shipped goods to China; now, China ships to us. Then, journalists defeated industrialists; now, tech founders beat journalists. Then, you had a white man ruling over India; now, an Indian man is the prime minister of the United Kingdom. The collection of examples was a hodgepodge, and the throughline between them was confused. If there was a central thesis, it is that the world increased in centralization and westernization in the first half of the 20th century, and that economic power moved away from the West and decentralized in the second half. Bitcoin, Srinivasan said, would be key to this decentralization, though exactly how was unclear. To Sherman, the pitch was like someone who “wants to start his own lifestyle brand … It’s just like, ‘I’ve got a vision of the future. I’m going to be Moses, and I&#8217;ll lead us to the promised land.’” Safe to say that, after Saturday’s event, Srinivasan may have lost some followers.&nbsp; The evening had been billed as a showing of “Technodemocracy,” a documentary produced and narrated by Srinivasan. Then there would be a live interchange with the wunderkind. So many guests signed up in late June that the event was moved from Gray Area in San Francisco to the Loom in Oakland.&nbsp; The event was the finale of Deep Tech Week , and guests were hyped. During the week, some 6,500 people attending 42 events heard that “the future is being built in San Francisco.” Srinivasan was at the top of its speakers list .&nbsp; Hundreds of attendees packed a warehouse-turned-events-space in West Oakland, with a bedazzled stilt walker greeting the long line that formed around a sign reading “The future is here.” Inside, guests were treated to white-washed brick walls, pink-and-purple neon lights, and fog machines; the atmosphere was more akin to a rave than a tech talk, as was the case at other events for the technology week. Attendees could get soft drinks or beer at the bar, or take a drink of liquor from a woman wearing a plastic tutu, which held shot glasses around her body. “We&#8217;re one step closer to this beautiful future where we bring so much abundance to the world … It’s the counterforce to doomerism,” said the moderator as he introduced what he called “a beautiful film” to cheers and whistles. But instead of a documentary, baffled audience members watched a 20-minute webinar recording in which Srinivasan presented slides. Bitcoin was front and center. “Is that the movie?” one participant asked to no one in particular. “I don’t know,” other audience members whispered. Some in the audience began to leave, making the already half-empty venue even emptier. “What did you think? Did we learn a lot?” the moderator asked, eliciting a few isolated claps.

The crowd at an afterparty following the Balaji Srinivasan event. Photo by Yujie Zhou, June 29, 2024. “I’m super disappointed. I did not clap,” said one woman who works in engineering and consulting in an interview after the event. “Deep Tech Week has been absolutely phenomenal. I was blown away by every single event that I’ve attended. This is why I came to this event,” the woman continued. As for this event, “I knew it was going to be a movie. I knew it was going to be polarizing, and it was gonna be political, and I might not agree with everything that’s gonna be said. But it was a fucking webinar recorded from 2023.” The live Q&amp;A was, instead, a Zoom call. Srinivasan, a former partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, who is allegedly based in Singapore, conducted the Q&amp;A through a free Zoom account with a 40-minute time limit. Srinivasan left seconds before the timer hit zero. Sitting in front of a shelf holding plastic plants, a globe, and his book “The Network State,” he showed little to no facial expression as he went through slide after slide or answered the audience’s questions. More than a dozen men and one woman lined up to ask the VC more about his talk. What would be his advice for a future U.S. president? one participant asked. “The right answer is going to be something more like the internet first than America first,” said Srinivasan. Some of Srinivasan’s fans remained firm, “I’ve followed Balaji for years now. He always has things to say. This [event] is a no-brainer for me to sign up for,” the fan said.&nbsp; A woman who came with her boyfriend said Srinivasan “has a point.” Her boyfriend, whose background is in economics, said he shared Srinivasan&#8217;s belief in the internet, but conceded that “‘internet first’ is a little early.” read more Balaji Srinivasan, VC pushing dystopian vision of S.F., backs plans for tech campus Latest news Men in MAGA hats, DOGE shirts demand access to files at S.F.

But not only is he a new generation, he might also be the first American vice president to take his intellectual armoury from the extremely online world of the New Right.&nbsp; Vance says he is ‘plugged into a lot of weird, right-wing subcultures’. He draws from a whole new political lexicon, one that would seem baffling to his more starched colleagues in the Congress. Even someone like Alexandra Ocasio Cortez – 34 years old – is taking her cues from a more orthodox political tradition.&nbsp; The New Right is a tag that has been worn by many radically different movements down the years. But this version crystallised most publicly in a 2022 Vanity Fair piece entitled ‘Inside The New Right, Where Peter Thiel Is Placing His Biggest Bets’. Vance worked under Thiel at Mithril Capital, and Thiel gave Vance $10 million for his Senate run in 2022.

Illustration by Jade Cuevas/POLITICO (source images via AP, Getty Images and iStock) By Ian Ward 07/18/2024 05:00 AM EDT Updated: 07/18/2024 11:45 AM EDT Link Copied Ian Ward is a reporter at POLITICO. JD Vance represents something genuinely unusual for the MAGA movement: A national Republican who is deeply enmeshed with the elite world of the conservative intellectual movement — or what’s sometimes termed for convenience as “the New Right” or “the dissident right.” As Vance himself confessed earlier this year, he is “ plugged into a lot of weird, right-wing subcultures .” His transition from Never-Trump conservative to MAGA firebrand was influenced by his relationships with a handful of niche conservative writers and thinkers. Among them are people who push for post-liberal regime change, some who pine for the cultural conservatism of Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, and one outright monarchist. This cohort espouses a variety of sometimes competing viewpoints, but they are bound together by the belief that the liberal project of “progress” — especially in the form of economic liberalization, technological advancement and the leveling of social hierarchies — has in fact been a mistake. Many of these thinkers are still far, far away from being household names — but with Vance on the top of the GOP ticket, they’re only one step away from having a direct line to the White House. Here are the key thinkers who have influenced JD Vance’s intellectual trajectory — and, if November goes Republicans’ way, could define the trajectory of the country. Patrick Deneen A professor of political theory at the University of Notre Dame, Deneen rose to prominence in 2018 with the publication of his book Why Liberalism Failed , a sweeping critique of small-l liberalism and a forceful argument for a more communitarian approach to American political life. In the book — which won plaudits from Barack Obama and The New York Times — Deneen argued that liberalism’s focus on individualism, secularism and free markets economics eroded the communal bases of American life — namely the nuclear family, shared religious faith and local economies. Deneen took a more radical approach in his next major book, Regime Change , published in 2023. In the book, Deneen — who is a conservative Catholic — argued for a “peaceful” revolution to replace liberalism with a “postliberal order” grounded in the promotion of conservative and religious values rather than the protection of individual rights. In practice, Deneen argued for “pro-family” and “pro-worker” economic policies like tariffs and manufacturing incentives, as well as foreign policy isolationism and strict social conservatism, including limits on gay marriage, gender-affirming care and abortion. Vance has publicly cited Deneen as a major intellectual influence and even appeared on a panel with him at the book launch for Regime Change , hosted at Catholic University in 2023. At the event, Vance identified himself as member of the “postliberal right” and said he views his role in Congress as “explicitly anti-regime,” channeling Deneen’s critic of liberal progressivism. In a statement after Vance’s selection, Deneen praised him as “a man of deep personal faith and integrity, a devoted family man, a generous friend, and a genuine patriot.” Peter Thiel Thiel is best known as Vance’s former venture capital boss and the primary funder of his 2022 Senate campaign, but he is also a close friend and major intellectual influence for Vance. The duo’s relationship began in 2011 when Vance — then a student at Yale Law School — attended a talk by Thiel in which he tied Silicon Valley’s failure to deliver truly revolutionary technologies to the stagnation of America’s political and social elites. As Vance later wrote of Thiel’s vision , “He saw these two trends — elite professionals trapped in hyper-competitive jobs, and the technological stagnation of society — as connected. If technological innovation were actually driving real prosperity, our elites wouldn’t feel increasingly competitive with one another over a dwindling number of prestigious outcomes.” Thiel’s political outlook is complex and contradictory , but it revolves around the idea that misguided liberal ideology, sclerotic government bureaucracy and feckless elites have perverted the trajectory of technological progress, turning technology into a tool of national and civilizational destruction rather than renewal. As Thiel famously put it , “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” Vance has not explained publicly exactly how much of Thiel’s worldview he shares, but the two men are close friends and regular conversation partners. “My relationship with Peter is what it has been for the close to 15 years that I’ve known him,” Vance told POLITICO Magazine earlier this year. “If there’s something interesting going on, and I want to bounce ideas off of a very fascinating and knowledgeable person, I’ll give him a call.” Curtis Yarvin Yarvin doesn’t hold any official title or office — he is an ex-computer programmer turned blogger, having first risen to prominence on the online right in the 2010s while blogging under the pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug.” But he’s often cited as the “house philosopher” of the New Right, chiefly for his promotion of the “neo-reactionary” (or “NRx”) movement. Like Deneen, Yarvin and his NRx followers reject the quest for “progress” as the core of political life. As Yarvin told Vanity Fair in 2022 , “The fundamental premise of liberalism is that there is this inexorable march toward progress. I disagree with that premise.” Instead, Yarvin believes that American democracy has denigrated into a corrupt oligarchy , run by elites who strive to consolidate their power rather than serve the public interest. The solution, Yarvin argues, is for the American oligarchy to give way to a monarchical leader styled after a start-up CEO — a “national CEO,” [or] what’s called a dictator,” as Yarvin has put it — who can de-bug the American political order like a computer programmer de-bugging some bad code. Vance has said he considers Yarvin a friend and has cited his writings in connection with his plan to fire a significant number of civil servants during a potential second Trump administration. “There’s this guy Curtis Yarvin, who has written about some of these things,” Vance said on a conservative podcast in 2021 , adding: “I think Trump is going to run again in 2024 [and] I think that what Trump should do, if I was giving him one piece of advice: Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.” René Girard A French-born philosopher and Catholic literary critic, Girard taught for several decades at Stanford University — where his acolytes included Peter Thiel. Thiel, in turn, introduced Girard’s ideas to his own protégé. Vance has said that he was particularly influenced by Girard’s idea of “mimetic rivalry” — the idea that humans want certain things because they see other people wanting those same things — and his related idea of the “scapegoat myth”: That this competition for shared goals and objects leads to social and political conflict, which most societies ultimately resolve by committing an act of violence against a perceived outsider. To Girard, early Christians were the first group to escape this cycle of violence because they scapegoated one of their own — Jesus Christ — rather than an outsider. Vance has credited his exposure to Girard — via Thiel — as a major impetus for his conversion to Catholicism in 2019: “Mired in the swamp of social media, we identified a scapegoat and digitally pounced. We were keyboard warriors, unloading on people via Facebook and Twitter, blind to our own problems. We fought over jobs we didn’t actually want while pretending we didn’t fight for them at all,” Vance wrote in a 2020 essay . “That all had to change. It was time to stop scapegoating and focus on what I could do to improve things.” Vance’s conversion, however, hasn’t put an entire stop to his days of online trolling . Sohrab Ahmari The writer Sohrab Ahmari’s political evolution is arguably even more circuitous than Vance’s: The son of a secular Iranian family, he emigrated to the U.S. as a teenager, became a Trotskyist in college, then took up the neoconservative cause as an editor at The Wall Street Journal before converting to Catholicism in 2016 — the same year he voted for Hillary Clinton out of disgust for Trump. He has since moved rightward, embracing Trump and becoming a chief advocate for a new style of “working-class conservatism” that has its roots in the tradition of Catholic social democracy — which Ahmari describes, half-jokingly , as “pro-life New Dealism.” Now, he’s the co-editor of Compact Magazine , an online journal that nominally brings together the populist right and left — but which has assertively promoted both Trump and Vance . Ahmari, meanwhile, remains close with Vance, having profiled him for several publications and hosted him at a buzzy conference for “Common Good” conservatives in 2022. In an interview with POLITICO Magazine after Trump’s selection, Ahmari said he was “thrilled” to have Vance on the ticket: “Donald Trump could have listened to the advice of many other characters and picked a conventional Republican,” he said. “Instead, he picked someone who is reviled by the keepers of the orthodoxy on free trade and foreign policy, and who is also in line with the kind of RNC platform that we saw released [last week].” He added: “If you want to push that platform, JD is the man to do it.” The Claremont Institute Based out of San Bernardino County, California, the Claremont Institute has become the intellectual nerve center of the Trumpist right since 2016, serving as the home to scholars like Michael Anton — whose infamous 2016 “ Flight 93” essay offered an early intellectual justification for Trump — as well as former Trump attorney John Eastman, who has been indicted for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election. Aside from its embrace of Trumpism, the institute is known as the home of “ West Coast Straussianism ,” a school of American political philosophy pioneered by the conservative historian and philosopher Harry V. Jaffa. The institute’s scholars and fellows hold a range of political positions, but they are united by the belief that America lost touch with its founding ideas somewhere around the Progressive Era, driven by government bureaucratization, the loss of public faith in the principles of “natural law” and the rise of “moral relativism” and multiculturalism (what could be called “wokeism,” in today’s parlance). Unlike Yarvin or Deneen, the Claremont crew tend to advocate a return to founding American principles like limited government and the protection of natural rights. In practical terms, this has led them to enthusiastically take up Trump’s crusade against the administrative state and “woke” initiatives like DEI and critical race theory. Vance is closely tied to Claremont circles, frequently speaking at their events and appearing alongside their scholars. In a statement to the American Conservative on Monday, Claremont President Ryan Williams called Vance “the ideal pick for Trump’s Vice President,” adding: “It’s hard to find a more articulate and passionate advocate for the politics and policies that will save American democracy from the forces of progressive oligarchy and despotism.” Rod Dreher The Orthodox Christian writer and former American Conservative columnist is best known as the leader of the “ crunchy cons ,” the “Birkenstocked Burkeans” and “gun-loving organic farmers” who embrace the countercultural, back-to-the-land attitudes typically associated with the hippie left but are themselves on the intellectual right. Dreher subsequently made a national splash with his 2017 book The Benedict Option , which counseled Christian conservatives to “embrace exile from the mainstream culture and construct a resilient counterculture” based on the Christian virtues. Since then, he has relocated primarily to Hungary, where he has become something of an intellectual consigliere in Viktor Orbán’s government . His latest book — which got a friendly plug from Vance — is subtitled “A Manual for Christian Dissidents.” Dreher’s friendship with Vance began in 2016, when Dreher became an early champion of “Hillbilly Elegy” on the right, calling it “one of the best books I’ve ever read” and conducting a much-talked-about interview with Vance for The American Conservative . (Dreher’s blog got booted from the magazine last year after his primary funder thought it had gotten “too weird.” ) The two remain friends, and Dreher even attended Vance’s baptism into the Catholic faith in Ohio in 2019. “I need to send our next vice president a copy of ‘The Benedict Option,’” Dreher joked online after Vance’s selection.

In this context, “rightism” and “leftism” both will only remain as academic and historical tropes—like Catharism or Lollardy. -Curtis Yarvin, writing in his newsletter, March 2024 So there’s this guy, Curtis Yarvin, who has written about some of these things&#8230; &#8211; JD Vance , September 2021 JD Vance, a 39-year-old whose resume makes Sarah Palin seem experienced, is officially on the Trump ticket. The faux-hillbilly turned venture capitalist turned US Senator is now vying to be the next Vice President of the United States. This week, let’s focus on the men ultimately responsible for Vance, Project 2025, and the infusion of Silicon Valley cash to bolster Trump’s campaign – Curtis Yarvin and his billionaire patron Peter Thiel. Advertisement Project 2025 is linked to “The Statement on Christian Nationalism” manifesto which seeks to implement a Scripture-based system of gov&#39;t whereby Christ-ordained “civil magistrates” exercise authority over the American public, reports @jennycohn1 . READ: https://t.co/TbcCo2f8JT pic.twitter.com/rHUFyL2s5Y &mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) March 7, 2024 Longtime readers will be familiar with Curtis Yarvin, who blogged for years as Mencius Moldbug. Yarvin founded&nbsp; neoreactionism AKA the Dark Enlightenmen t, a political movement popular among certain tech circles. Neoreactionism calls for the fall of democracies and a return to monarchy and aristocracy. Shockingly, neoreactionaries believe that new aristocracy should come from tech and business. Yarvin’s writing fixates on the power of the so-called “Cathedrals”: media, academia, and government institutions which he and his followers believe shape public opinion and rule America. (It’s worth noting that Yarvin’s&nbsp; parents &nbsp;were government civil servants.) A Vox profile from 2022&nbsp; explains Yarvin’s deal &nbsp;pretty well: But he stands out among right-wing commentators for being probably the single person who’s spent the most time gaming out how, exactly, the U.S. government could be toppled and replaced — “rebooted” or “reset,” as he likes to say — with a monarch, CEO, or dictator at the helm. Yarvin argues that a creative and visionary leader — a “startup guy,” like, he says, Napoleon or Lenin was — should seize absolute power, dismantle the old regime, and build something new in its place. READ: JD Vance—Who Once Called Trump ‘America’s Hitler’—Is Now His Choice for Vice President To Yarvin, incremental reforms and half-measures are necessarily doomed. The only way to achieve what he wants is to assume “ absolute power ,” and the game is all about getting to a place where you can pull that off. Critics have called his ideas “ fascist ” — a term he disputes , arguing that centralizing power under one ruler long predates fascism and that his ideal monarch should rule for all rather than fomenting a class war as fascists do. “Autocratic” fits as a descriptor, though his preferred term is “monarchist.” You won’t find many on the right saying they wholly support Yarvin’s program — especially the “ monarchy ” thing — but his critique of the status quo and some of his ideas for changing it have influenced several increasingly prominent figures. JD Vance’s rhetoric will sound familiar to anyone who read Yarvin’s work. Vance has cited Yarvin as an influence, but the connection runs deeper. Both Yarvin and Vance have the support and backing of Peter Thiel, an early Trump supporter in 2016 who&nbsp; gave a primetime speech &nbsp;at the 2016 convention. If Yarvin informed Vance’s thinking, Thiel fueled his political ambitions by funding a Super PAC for Vance’s 2022 Senate run. Without Thiel’s financial backing, it’s hard to imagine Vance would be in the Senate, much less the Republican nominee for Vice President. I don’t think it’s a&nbsp; coincidence &nbsp;that Musk and other reactionaries in tech&nbsp; announced major donations &nbsp;to a pro-Trump Super PAC the same week that Vance was announced. These folks&nbsp; are thrilled &nbsp;to have Vance on the ticket. The cash infusion couldn’t be better for the Trump campaign, especially given the state of the&nbsp; RNC and state Republican parties . Of course we have no way of determining if that figured into Trump’s choosing Vance, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a factor. . @kathsstewart , author of &quot;The Power Worshippers: The Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism,&#39; told Editor @cmychalejko a speech like Senator Josh Hawley’s &#39;The Christian Nationalism We Need’ wouldn&#39;t have been possible 20 years ago. &quot;This is a big deal.&quot; https://t.co/0oBPknkE1P pic.twitter.com/HiyU5QahB7 &mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) July 16, 2024 Project 2025 &nbsp;was crafted by acolytes of neoreactionism. Yarvin is their prophet, Vance is their Moses, and Thiel is more than willing to spend whatever it takes to make this hellish vision of humanity into our reality. Donald Trump might try to distance himself from Project 2025, but he’s always leaned into neoreactionist ideas and imagery. The&nbsp; God Emperor &nbsp;is a monarch who will return America to being a white supremacist nation where men like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk hold power and control over all of us. It’s always interesting to revisit older articles about neoreactionaries from the movement’s days as a niche Silicon Valley fixation. In 2013 a TechCrunch&nbsp; article states &nbsp;“To be clear though, pure neoreaction is an extreme minority position that will probably never catch on beyond a tiny cult following.” The reporter is alarmed but also sure there’s no way this could ever become a mainstream movement.&nbsp; A Baffler article from&nbsp; around the same time &nbsp;better understands neoreactionism’s potential, saying “Neoreactionaries are&nbsp; explicitly &nbsp;courting&nbsp; wealthy elites &nbsp;in the tech sector as the most receptive and influential audience. Why bother with mass appeal when you’re rebuilding the ancien régime?” READ: Senator Bernie Sanders Warns in New Report of Right-Wing Billionaire Plot to Sabotage Public Education in Order to Privatize It Courting wealthy elites is key here. Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and their fellow billionaires are more than happy to spend ungodly sums of money to bend the rest of us to their will and worldview. Yarvin simply played to what they already believe about themselves: that they’re smarter than us and actually, they should rule the world. Vance is more than happy to do the same on his own path to power. These folks claim again and again that neoreactionism isn’t racist, but Yarvin is on the record&nbsp; defending slavery and endorsing racist pseudoscience . (Vance is in a mixed-race marriage and has endorsed the same&nbsp; racist pseudo-science .) There’s a direct line from billionaires believing DEI and the existence of trans people are oppressing them to Yarvin and neoreaction.&nbsp; Here’s the good news. As I’ve said time and time again, most Americans don’t want to live in a fascist hellscape. There are more of us than there are of them, and we can beat them just as we have in every election since 2016. I won’t pretend that’s going to be an easy task this time around, but I was heartened at how Project 2025 has broken into the political conversation this summer, so much that Trump&nbsp; falsely claimed &nbsp;it wasn’t his agenda. JD Vance’s nomination gives us a chance to sound the alarm on Project 2025, the folks behind it, and the future MAGA wants from now until Election Day.

Vance Gets His Weird, Terrifying Techno-Authoritarian Ideas Yes, Peter Thiel was the senator’s benefactor. But they’re both inspired by an obscure software developer who has some truly frightening thoughts about reordering society. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Vance at the Republican National Convention last week In 2008, a software developer in San Francisco named Curtis Yarvin , writing under a pseudonym , proposed a horrific solution for people he deemed “not productive”: “convert them into biodiesel, which can help power the Muni buses.” Yarvin, a self-described reactionary and extremist who was 35 years old at the time, clarified that he was “just kidding.” But then he continued, “The trouble with the biodiesel solution is that no one would want to live in a city whose public transportation was fueled, even just partly, by the distilled remains of its late underclass. However, it helps us describe the problem we are trying to solve. Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. ” He then concluded that the “best humane alternative to genocide” is to “virtualize” these people: Imprison them in “permanent solitary confinement” where, to avoid making them insane, they would be connected to an “immersive virtual-reality interface” so they could “experience a rich, fulfilling life in a completely imaginary world.” Yarvin’s disturbing manifestos have earned him influential followers, chief among them: tech billionaire Peter Thiel and his onetime Silicon Valley protégé Senator J.D. Vance, whom the Republican Party just nominated to be Donald Trump’s vice president. If Trump wins the election, there is little doubt that Vance will bring Yarvin’s twisted techno-authoritarianism to the White House, and one can imagine—with horror—what a receptive would-be autocrat like Trump might do with those ideas. Trump’s first campaign was undoubtedly a watershed moment for authoritarianism in American politics, but some thinkers on the right had been laying the groundwork for years, hoping for someone to mainstream their ideas. Yarvin was one of them. Way back in 2012, in a speech on “ How to Reboot the US Government ,” he said, “If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia.” He had also written favorably of slavery and white nationalists in the late 2000s (though he has stated that he is not a white nationalist himself). Both Thiel and Vance are friends of Yarvin . In The Contrarian : Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power, reporter Max Chafkin describes Yarvin as the “house political philosopher” of the “Thielverse,” a term for the people in Thiel’s orbit. In 2013, Thiel invested in Tlön, a software startup co-founded by Yarvin. In 2016, Yarvin attended Thiel’s election night party in San Francisco where, according to Chafkin, champagne flowed once it became clear that Thiel’s investment in Donald Trump would pay off. Since entering politics, Vance has publicly praised—and parroted—Yarvin’s ideas. That was worrying enough when Vance was only a senator. Now that he could soon be a heartbeat away from the presidency, his close ties to Yarvin are more alarming than ever. Superficial analyses of why certain tech billionaires are aligning with Trump tend to fixate on issues like taxes and regulations, but that’s only part of the story. Tech plutocrats like Thiel and Elon Musk already have money. Now they want power—as much as money can buy. Stories about Vance tend to focus on his hardscrabble Ohio roots, but his relationship with Thiel—and his stint in San Francisco—are key to understanding his politics. Vance owes his meteoric rise to Thiel, who largely bankrolled it. As a Yale Law student in 2011, he heard Thiel give a speech in which he suggested that smart people should be working in tech instead of wasting their time at elite schools. Afterward, Vance emailed Thiel, who invited him to California. Following a brief stint as a lawyer, Vance moved to San Francisco. Eventually, he landed at Mithril Capital, a company co-founded by Thiel. He finished writing Hillbilly Elegy while there, and Thiel wrote a blurb praising it. When Vance moved back to Ohio and eventually started his own fund, Narya Capital , both Thiel and Marc Andreessen invested. When Vance ran for U.S. Senate in 2022, Thiel spent an unprecedented $15 million on the campaign and persuaded Trump to endorse him (Vance had previously compared Trump to Hitler ). In 2024, Thiel led the charge to convince Trump to pick Vance as V.P. Vance is a Thiel creation. And like his billionaire benefactor—who once wrote , “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible”—Vance embraces a radical ideology hell-bent on destroying government as we know it. And they got these ideas, at least in part, from Yarvin. Yarvin is the chief thinker behind an obscure but increasingly influential far-right neoreaction, or NRx, movement, that some call the “ Dark Enlightenment .” Among other things, it openly promotes dictatorships as superior to democracies and views nations like the United States as outdated software systems. Yarvin seeks to reengineer governments by breaking them up into smaller entities called “patchworks,” which would be controlled by tech corporations. “The basic idea of Patchwork is that, as the crappy governments we inherited from history are smashed, they should be replaced by a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions,” he wrote in Patchwork: A Political System for the 21st Century. Each patchwork would be ruled by a “realm”: a corporation with absolute power. Citizens would be free to move, but every other realm would also be ruled by corporate governments with chilling impunity. For example, Yarvin says the tech overlords of the San Francisco realm could arbitrarily decide to cut off its citizens’ hands with no fear of legal consequences—because they’re a sovereign power, beholden to no federal government or laws. The realm, having sovereign power, can compel the resident to comply with all promises. Since San Francisco is not an Islamic state, it does not ask its residents to agree that their hand will be cut off if they steal. But it could. And San Francisco, likewise, can promise not to cut off its residents’ hands until it is blue in the face—but, since it is a sovereign state, no one can enforce this promise against it. In “Friscorp,” as Yarvin calls the San Francisco realm, an all-seeing Orwellian surveillance system would enforce public safety: “All residents, even temporary visitors, carry an ID card with RFID response. All are genotyped and iris-scanned. Public places and transportation systems track everyone. Security cameras are ubiquitous. Every car knows where it is, and who is sitting in it, and tells the authorities both.” Vance has not advocated for realms—yet—but some of his most extreme ideas echo Yarvin. They’re both fond of political purges, for instance. In a 2021 podcast interview , Vance was asked how to get liberals out of government institutions. “De-Nazification, De-Baathification,” he replied. “I tend to think that we should seize the institutions of the left. And turn them against the left. We need like a de-Baathification program, a de-woke-ification program.” He predicted Trump would run again and win, then offered some advice: “I think that what Trump should do, if I was giving him one piece of advice: Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.” He added that Trump should defy any court orders that tried to halt this partisan purge of the civil service. Yarvin calls this plan RAGE: Retire All Government Employees . It’s captured perfectly in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for a second Trump administration, which calls for firing an estimated 500,000 federal employees and dismantling entire agencies. If Trump wins, Vance may well be in charge of executing the plan. Vance did not get this extremist ideology from his Appalachian upbringing or—needless to say—Yale Law. It was incubated in America’s tech capital, San Francisco, where he forged crucial ties with Thiel, Yarvin, and David Sacks , the longtime Thiel associate and pro-Putin crusader who recently hosted a Trump fundraiser at his mansion in Pacific Heights. And if Vance ends up in the White House, it will be with $45 million in monthly campaign contributions from Musk , who already made a $44 billion in-kind contribution by gutting San Francisco-based Twitter and transforming it into a right-wing misinformation weapon. In a fateful twist, San Francisco also launched the political career of Kamala Harris, who is set to inherit the task of saving American democracy from tech authoritarianism.

There are no suggestions because the search field is empty. The Horrifying Fascist Manifesto Endorsed By J.D. Vance A disturbing book plans a ruthless total war against the “unhuman” left. Nathan J. Robinson filed 31 July 2024 in Politics T he book Unhumans , by Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec, is a fascist manifesto. It argues that the “Great Men of History” should take their cues from homicidal dictators like Augusto Pinochet and Francisco Franco, reject reason and democracy, and ruthlessly annihilate the gangs of communist “unhumans” who are currently threatening to destroy the United States. It explicitly advocates “eye for an eye” justice, promising a new McCarthyism complete with blacklists, along with the immediate banning of all teachers’ unions. It is perhaps the most paranoid, hateful, and terrifying book I have ever picked up. (I say this as someone who has read Mein Kampf. ) And it comes with a warm and supportive blurb from Ohio senator J.D. Vance, who is currently the Republican party’s vice presidential nominee. Vance had this to say of Unhumans :&nbsp; In the past, communists marched in the streets waving red flags. Today, they march through HR [Human Resources], college campuses, and courtrooms to wage lawfare against good, honest people. In Unhumans, Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec reveal their plans and show us what to do to fight back. Vance, then, has endorsed without qualification both the analysis and the plan laid out in Unhumans , saying it’s what needs to be done to “fight back.” Several other figures in Donald Trump’s orbit have also praised the book. It comes with additional blurbs from Donald Trump Jr. (who says it shows the “playbook” needed to “save the West”), Michael Flynn (“[ Unhumans ] offers a fifth-generation warfare system to fight back and win”), Tucker Carlson (“Jack Posobiec sees the big picture”) and Steve Bannon, who wrote the foreword. (“Study this book. Share this book.”) Trump himself has probably not read it, since it is a book, but he has previously boosted co-author Jack Posobiec on Twitter. Posobiec himself is a far-right activist who is possibly an outright neo-Nazi, but, at the very least, both antisemitic and demonstrably fascist. The text of Unhumans, as we will see, leaves little room for dispute on the latter point. He is known for spreading political falsehoods ( such as the Pizzagate nonsense , which caused the employees of a D.C. pizza place to be relentlessly terrorized by unhinged strangers from the internet ). He engages in quixotic acts of political disruption, such as making a scene during Shakespeare In The Park , calling for a boycott of&nbsp; Star Wars , and planting a “Rape Melania” sign among anti-Trump protesters to discredit them. He has worked for Turning Point USA, OANN, and Human Events , as well as Citizens for Trump, “ the largest Trump grassroots organization in the US. ” Co-author Joshua Lisec is less infamous, being a professional ghostwriter who has worked with Dilbert creator Scott Adams as well as various influencer and life coach types . Unhumans is both a manifesto and a guide for action. Its central argument, which I will state as dispassionately as possible, is that leftists are not fellow human beings who should be accepted as part of a pluralistic society, but rather “unhumans” bent on destroying the civilized order. Citing the usual parade of 20th century communist dictators (Mao, Lenin, Stalin, Pol Pot), Posobiec and Lisec argue that even if it may not look like the contemporary United States is under threat from a communist revolution, we are under threat, besieged by furtive, scheming unhumans who must be rooted out before they can consummate their fiendish plot to commit mass murder. Stopping the unhumans will require shedding commitments to democracy, free speech, reasoned debate, and tolerance of alternate points of view. Instead, they argue, the right should find its role models in Caesar, Joseph McCarthy, and various murderous anti-communist dictators of the 20th century.&nbsp; Like I say, I’ve tried to put this fairly dispassionately. But it’s incredibly disturbing, and argued very seriously in the book, which repeatedly praises Spanish dictator Francisco Franco—who, let us remember, was responsible for “mass killings, torture and the systematic, general and illegal detentions of political opponents.” Franco’s White Terror killed hundreds of thousands of people, based on Franco’s notion of “social cleansing,” and “ turned the country into an immense prison. ” How do Posobiec and Lisec rationalize their praise of dictators? Essentially, they argue that to stop communism, ugly means are required. They advocate what they call “the Iron Law of Exact Reciprocity,” which means, essentially, do unto others what they have done unto you, no matter how horrible. It is the dark inverse of the Golden Rule, which is “treat others as you would like to be treated,” and while it sounds superficially similar it’s actually a moral justification for brutal revenge:&nbsp; To fight back, conservatives, centrists, moderates, and even good liberals will need to embrace something they have never considered. They must embrace exact reciprocity. That which is done by the communist and the regime must be done unto them. They imply that because Mao and Stalin used torture, suppressed dissent, and executed their opponents, these methods were legitimate and necessary when deployed by Pinochet and Franco. The priority should be to eliminate communism altogether, even if that means engaging in widespread human rights abuses like throwing people to their deaths from helicopters:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Pinochet offered reciprocal punishment to the communist revolutionaries, demoralizing their cause and diminishing their ranks. All allies of anti-civilization were ruthlessly excised from Chilean society. The story of tossing communists out of helicopters hails from Pinochet’s elimination of communism during the mid to late 1970s. Wherever Pinochet was, there was no communism. And the globalist intelligentsia didn’t like that. Not one little bit.&nbsp; Pinochet’s extrajudicial executions and torture, then, including the killing of Chilean poet and singer Victor Jara, were therefore praiseworthy acts of resistance to the sinister plot of the “globalist intelligentsia.” Posobiec and Lisec claim, without the slightest evidence, that democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende might have “kill[ed] upward of a million of his countrymen to gain absolute power,” hence Pinochet was justified in staging a coup and imposing a dictatorship. (With, of course, the full backing of the Nixon administration.)&nbsp; Unhumans follows the standard conservative modus operandi of conjuring a terrifying bogeyman , trying to scare the shit out of you, and warning that unless the bogeyman is stopped, civilization is going to collapse. Paranoia and fear are at the core of right-wing politics, with a rotating cast of villains including marauding immigrants, LGBTQ “groomers,” BLM activists coming to burn down your city, The Chinese, Antifa, Iran , teachers’ unions, The Online Social Justice Mob, “globalists,” and now even “ childless cat ladies .” Unhumans says the enemy is still communism, which they say is very much a threat in the 2024 United States, and wants to kill a billion people:&nbsp; Unhumans still support communism after it killed 100 million people in the twentieth century. They are not bothered that communism killed 100 million people. In fact, they think 100 million deaths is just a good start. Those wholly possessed by resentment want to 10X that number. On a base level, unhumans seek the death of the successful and the desecration of the beautiful. They want to smash civilization. And so whenever and wherever they gain power, they do. And yet, conservatives would rather whine about equal treatment while unhumans are drawing them toward freshly dug graves. Now, Posobiec and Lisec are aware that when they say things like this, the average person will think it sounds wildly out of touch with reality, on the level of someone who sees pink elephants or thinks the feds are sending radio signals to their dental fillings. They admit that the actual U.S. Communist Party has “no meaningful influence.” But, they say, communists are sneaky. The “communist cause” is a “chameleon” with “many shades,” and “complements whoever has the power to wedge a society into separate, angry factions.” This allows them to lump all contemporary progressives in with the communist plot. They see aspects of the plot even in incidents that seemingly have nothing to do with communism, such as when people got mad after Scott Adams suggested white people should “get the hell away from Black people.” (They claim Adams’s “one and only offense was to state a viewpoint that no one disagreed with ,” namely that “Americans [should] stay away from embittered groups who hate them.”) The authors blow up Twitter controversies into signs of civilizational rot and a communist guerrilla insurgency. You see, “the Scott Adams story is not an isolated incident.” It “is one among many of easy-to-find examples of the low-intensity, highly targeted uprising against normal people the unhumans force on individuals every single day.” “Communism has been rebranded,” which is part of the “covert tactics” that communists use. What proof is there of this? Well, who needs proof when instead you have a vague feeling of unease:&nbsp; Something is deeply wrong with the way things are going and you know it. You may not be able to explain it with studies, surveys, or statistics, but you feel it. You’ve felt this way for a while. Like there’s some outside force or group or . . . something . . . that’s sent us all off course from the libertarian utopia we should’ve achieved by now. It doesn’t seem like one -ism or -ation is entirely to blame, like globalism or immigration, capitalism or inflation. … Evidence of the unhuman activity is everywhere we look. But can we really pin all those on communists? Nobody pays attention to CPUSA. And there hasn’t been a Carmelite nun–style massacre. Or mass arrest and torture of landlords. But they’re arresting landlords in New York City, now. And yet . . . the history of the revolution . . . the present day . . . it feels directionally accurate, doesn’t it? [idiosyncratic ellipses in original]&nbsp; To summarize: there may be no evidence that there is a vast communist plot to destroy the country. The crimes of Stalin and Mao are long in the past, and in no way does contemporary American life contain anything similar. And yet: people are unhappy. They think something is wrong. And so why not believe it’s all part of a giant sinister conspiracy? It “feels” accurate, at least “directionally,” and after all, as the right loves to say, feelings are just as legitimate as facts. We can see here some of the common techniques of right-wing propaganda. Not only do they always identify a sinister civilization-destroying enemy, but they also encourage you to blame that enemy for every problem in your life, even the problems that are obviously caused by the policies that the right supports. So, for example, your low wages are the fault of immigrants, not the fabulously rich employer who underpays you. The right encourages working people to hate and fear their fellow workers instead of banding together with them. So, for instance, your children’s public school teachers are actually your enemy, and their collective bargaining rights must be destroyed:&nbsp; We recommend the immediate banning of all public education unions in the United States, as these institutions hold a near-monopoly on the rearing of America’s publicly schooled children and are thus uniquely responsible for the disparity in outcomes between and among underclass, working, middle, and upper- class students. They’ve got to go. … A full-scale lawfare assault against the teachers’ unions until every last one is shut down is a necessary path forward. We can observe here further proof that right-wing “populism” is a fraud. J.D. Vance is supposedly one of the leading right-wing “ populists ,” but has endorsed a plan for a full-scale legal war to break the back of a major part of the labor movement. Posobiec and Lisec make it clear that they’re on the side of elites against uprisings by the masses. They defend Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. (She “was not some obstinate socialite. In fact, she gave greatly to philanthropic endeavors and founded charity houses all over France.”) According to them, Franco just wanted a “traditional Catholic monarchy, which had been foundational to Spanish civilization for centuries,” and thus became “a Washingtonian figure but without term limits.” (George Washington, famously, loved monarchies.) The Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza is praised because he “graduated from West Point, loved America, and hated communists.” They argue that white Rhodesia and South Africa were wrecked by the anti-racist struggle. Nelson Mandela, for instance, was a ""communist"" who became the “darling of the Western progressive elite” and helped put South Africa onto a “downward equity spiral.” Of course there’s also a section on the U.S. civil rights movement, which was not the “moral fable” of your history textbook but in fact set cities on fire and did lasting damage to the social order.&nbsp; I don’t know if it’s worth noting that the book is, uh, not particularly scrupulous about getting its facts right. Who expects scholarly rigor from a Pizzagate promoter like Posobiec? Nevertheless, anyone who checks will find some howlers. Jan. 6th was in fact a “trap,” an “insurrection…against President Trump,” and “the locking up of patriots was always the goal.” Of George Orwell, they say that “prior to service in the [Spanish Civil War], he had been pro-socialist. But after witnessing the violent purges of the Rojos side for himself, he was put off by all left-wingers from then onward.” Anyone who has read Orwell’s memoir knows that it contains a stirring defense of socialist values, even though he was harshly critical of Stalinism. In 1946, well after the Spanish Civil War, Orwell wrote that “Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it.""&nbsp; But I don’t want to spend too much time fisking Unhumans for sloppiness, because the point is not that it’s error-riddled, it’s that it’s terrifying and fascistic, encouraging readers to embrace a paranoid view that literally dehumanizes their fellow Americans and fosters an atmosphere of total war. Anyone who believes what this book says, which apparently includes our possible future Vice President, is going to be capable of utterly monstrous deeds. Posobiec and Lisec do insist that, while they praise brutal dictators who threw people out of helicopters and tortured them by the thousands, “nothing here in this section or in this book advocates illegal violence.” Some of what they say on this is contradictory. For instance, they say that “Unhumans rob and kill. We do not.” But elsewhere, they encourage readers to embrace the tactics of the “unhumans,” due to the Iron Law of Reciprocity and the validity of the “eye for an eye” principle. Their specific recommendations lean towards “lawfare” (intentionally filing frivolous criminal charges and lawsuits in order to harm people), “infiltrating” institutions (such as getting onto university governing boards so you can fire professors), publishing blacklists, and following the “Libs of TikTok” strategy of exposing people to public hatred . But even this, they say, “amounts to perhaps 0.01 percent of the effort required to identify and oust Cultural Marxists from positions and institutions in their clutches.” They do not say what extreme forms of behavior might be included in the remaining 99.99 percent of their counterrevolutionry warfare.&nbsp; However, even though they don’t come out in favor of outright exterminating the “unhumans,” they do encourage their readers to think in ways that make extreme violence a much more reasonable-seeming proposition. After all, the enemy is unhuman . Steve Bannon says in his introduction that “‘humanity’ only happens when you have an actual civilization—principles of civility, rules of law and order, respect for basic human rights.” The unhumans possess no humanity. So would it be that bad to place them in concentration camps? Why would you have a problem exterminating them? They’re unhuman. And they’d do the same thing to you! After all, as Posobiec and Lisec say, “violence is nature’s way.” So even if the authors of Unhumans haven’t advocated killing the “communists” (a category that seems to include all contemporary social justice activists and anyone who criticizes Scott Adams on Twitter), they have reduced or eliminated many arguments for not killing them. And it would be trivially easy for someone a notch further to the right of Posobiec and Lisec to use the premises of their book to prove to them that they are simply refusing to face the ugly, necessary conclusions that follow. “If you say these people are unhumans, and you say they are bent on destroying humanity,” this person may say, “then not to exterminate them is pure spinelessness.” Even if they don’t think Pinochet’s practice of dropping people from helicopters needs to be revived, they make it clear that it is in no way to be condemned. (And they deplore the human rights groups who tried to hold Pinochet accountable for his crimes, saying that they “used lawfare to harass and discredit Pinochet after he stepped down from power to terrorize future leaders in South America and abroad from putting up effective resistance to communism.”)&nbsp; Notably, Posobiec and Lisec do not seem to care at all about civil liberties. They say that they “believe in beauty, truth, law, and order.” Tolerance and freedom of expression are absent from that list. They are very explicit in saying that democracy is not a priority, admiringly quoting Franco saying “we do not believe in government through the voting booth.” They comment that “Democracy has never worked to protect innocents from the unhumans. It is time to stop playing by rules they won’t.” The “great American counterrevolution to depose the Cultural Marxists” must be conducted “with the resolve of Franco and the thoroughness of McCarthy.” Beyond Franco, McCarthy, and Pinochet, their models include “Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Pyotr Wrangel , [and] Chiang Kai-shek.” These men were not squeamish about using violence, or terribly concerned with popular legitimacy. Reasoned discourse itself must be jettisoned. We do not “reason with unreasonables,” Posobiec and Lisec say. Humility is weakness. “Never apologize,” they say. (Never fact-check either, of course.) Steve Bannon has similarly said that he rejects being “reasonable” because he sees himself as being in a war. “Conservatives have lost years of ground by being obsessed with debating ‘facts and logic’ rather than doing the grubby work of entering institutions and remaking them from inside,” Posobiec and Lisec write. You should not listen to or empathize with people. You should not scrutinize your own ideology to see if it might be a paranoid ghost story wildly out of touch with reality. You should just be hell-bent on making war against your inhuman enemies, because “The unhumans will not stop until they are stopped. And we must stop them.” &nbsp; I recently spoke with one of the world’s leading experts on dehumanization, philosopher David Livingstone Smith, author of books like Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others , On Inhumanity: Dehumanization and How to Resist It , and Making Monsters: The Uncanny Power of Dehumanization . Smith warns that dehumanization has been a critical step toward the enactment of history’s worst atrocities, such as the Holocaust or the Rwandan genocide. When we see people as less than human, as monsters, it feels less wrong to do horrible things to them. This is a seemingly obvious point, but Smith argues that it’s not obvious, because perfectly normal, moral people don’t notice themselves doing it. Dehumanization is, Smith argues, one of the most dangerous tendencies there is, because of what it implicitly licenses.&nbsp; Lisec has denied that Unhumans treats contemporary progressives as subhuman. The book has attracted press coverage because of Vance’s endorsement, and in a statement (sent to me by his publicist) he denied the allegation against it: [T]hese non-conservative media publications are spreading misinformation, including saying that JD Vance endorsed our book, which they claim calls progressives ""unhuman."" If you even read the book, it's about communism, exposing dehumanizers on the Far Left. Nowhere does anyone call progressives ""unhuman."" Now, I’m not sure how “saying that JD Vance endorsed our book” is “spreading misinformation,” since Vance’s blurb appears on the back cover and in a previous statement the authors said “we are honored to receive Senator JD Vance's acknowledgment and praise for our new book. … To have someone on the right with his influence understand the Iron Law of Exact Reciprocity as detailed in ‘Unhumans,’ is civilization-altering.” As for Lisec’s claim that the book isn’t branding progressives unhuman, he’s simply lying about the contents, perhaps because he realizes the book threatens to be an explosive political liability for Vance. After all, if the book is not calling progressives “unhuman,” then who are all the contemporary “unhumans” the book spends page after page exhorting us to ruthlessly fight? They admit that actual self-declared capital-C Communists are rare these days. In fact, precisely what the book is doing is treating the contemporary left as less than human, which Posobiec made clear in a speech to the Heritage Foundation-sponsored National Conservatism Conference:&nbsp; We don’t negotiate with globalist neo-Marxists. We don’t negotiate with the political version of an auto-immune disease. In a word, ladies and gentlemen—taken from the title of my book—we don’t negotiate with un-humans. Because that’s the stakes of this battle: humanity versus un-humanity. Populist nationalists versus atheist Marxist globalists. Strength, beauty, and genius versus weakness, ugliness, and stupidity. Civilization versus barbarism. Crime and chaos versus law and order… Hamilton Nolan notes that after Posobiec finished, Kansas senator Roger Marshall praised him: “Boy, great job, Jack… When people ask me what’s the hope out there, Jack’s voice is one of them.” This means that the outright dehumanization of the left is fully mainstream in Republican politics. Speaking of Posobiec’s address, David Livingstone Smith told me that history shows this kind of rhetoric needs to be taken very seriously. “This is,” he said, “in my view, a fascist style of politics. That style of politics is particularly associated with demonization… This is very, very dangerous.” And it’s not just Posobiec. Smith warns that Trump’s own speeches are full of exactly the same kind of demonization, the talk of “ vermin ” and enemies who are “poisoning the blood of our country.” I have written before of the alarming presence on the right of outright fascist rhetoric about weak “ bug men ” who must be ground underfoot. Now, I have made clear before that I don’t think it’s easy to know what J.D. Vance actually believes, since he has a record of being an opportunist whose rhetoric shifts. (An aspect of him I tried to capture in my lyrics to the song “ The Ballad of J.D. Vance .”) But I don’t really care to speculate on how sincere he is in his endorsement of the plan in Unhumans. The fact is that he says he believes in a fascist manifesto, and the fact that a vice presidential nominee has outright endorsed Francoism should be treated as a five-alarm emergency in any country that wants to preserve its democratic institutions. Vance has suggested elsewhere that the right should ignore the law and “go in directions that a lot of conservatives right now are uncomfortable with.” One of the points that we have made in Current Affairs for years is that we must always focus on the most important criticisms of the right. The latest Democratic line of attack against Trump and Vance is that they are “ weird ,” which is true, but I think somewhat beside the point, and gets us debating the wrong thing. (I’m a bit weird. Weird is fine.) Other criticisms are just in error, like suggesting Vance only wants “white children” when his own children are biracial. Kamala Harris suggested Vance is not “loyal to our country,” which I think is a foolish criticism to make of a military veteran whose stated politics are extremely nationalistic. I think we must be very clear about what the threat here is, which is that Trump and Vance have a radical authoritarian agenda and do not care about democracy or the rule of law. The Unhumans plan endorsed by Vance, Bannon, Don Jr., and Flynn is much scarier even than the “ Project 2025 ” Trump is desperately trying to distance himself from. They are encouraging dehumanization and the creation of imaginary enemies, which lays the groundwork for acts of repression and violence. In encouraging people to embrace Unhumans, Vance has endorsed the outright dehumanization of the left, while Trump’s rhetoric about migrant “ animals ” fuels the paranoia of people like the guy who killed dozens of Latinos in a Walmart to stop the “ Hispanic invasion .” (We should always be careful about making cause-and-effect links between political rhetoric and the acts of random shooters, of course, but it’s easy to see how telling people that they are in a war, that there are invaders everywhere, and that the invaders will rape or kill them is not making acts like this any less likely.)&nbsp; There are, according to Posobiec and Lisec, unhumans everywhere:&nbsp; You may already be a subject of unhumans. You are employed by unhumans. You are married to . . . you get it. You know. There’s nowhere for you to run or to hide. You are at the mercy of those who show no mercy. We will not fault you for doing what you must to survive…&nbsp; What is a person who believes this capable of? Well, we know what Pinochet and Franco were capable of, and J.D. Vance’s blurb doesn’t suggest he disagrees with Unhumans’ praise for these dictators. The worldview of this book is fascistic. And that means, if we take Vance’s words seriously, that the potential next vice president is also a fascist sympathizer. So are many of those in the orbit of the potential next president. I cannot overstate how dangerous this is. The word “fascist” is, notoriously, thrown around so much as to become meaningless. Personally, I try to be careful with it. I reserve it for mass murdering dictators like Franco and Benito Mussolini, and those who endorse these men’s methods. I think we can safely use it in this case. Fortunately, America has a strong tradition of anti- fascism. Neo-Nazis have always been marginal in this country, because Americans are proud of their role in helping the Soviet Union beat the Nazis. Americans are, by and large, a rambunctious people who do not like to be ruled over by autocrats. If they understand that they are facing a genuine authoritarian threat, I am confident that the majority of them will oppose it. But will they understand? Books like Unhumans attempt to convince them that the threat in fact comes from immigrants, unions, or even their own spouses, rather than from people like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk , oligarchs who think popular self-government was a mistake. We must do our best to show the true nature of the danger the country is in, and be ready to stand against it. &nbsp; More from Nathan J.

Trump's weird 'Freedom Cities' and the Network State cult,The Nerdreich,13/08/2024,https://www.thenerdreich.com/trumps-weird-freedom-cities-and-the-network-state-cult/,"Trump&#x27;s weird &#x27;Freedom Cities&#x27; and the Network State cult Home About Sign in Subscribe Trump&#x27;s weird &#x27;Freedom Cities&#x27; and the Network State cult Why do Trump, Thiel and Andreessen want to build new cities? Gil Duran 13 Aug 2024 — 5 min read ""Freedom Cities."" Hmm, where have we hear this idea before? Photo by Morgan Lane / Unsplash The Point: In another bow to Peter Thiel and the weird Network State tech cult, Donald Trump's campaign platform has a plan to create new charter cities (so-called "" Freedom Cities "") on federal land. It's a clear indicator of his willingness to sell out the country to his far right Silicon Valley benefactors. In fact, Thiel and Marc Andreessen are funding an entire company – Pronomos Capital – dedicated to building such futuristic tech cities around the world. The Backstory: "" Kamala has nothing like this on her website,"" declared Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini on Twitter yesterday. His post included text from Trump's campaign website that promises to build "" Freedom Cities "": President Trump will work to open up the American Frontier, holding a contest to charter new cities where families and individuals can have a new shot of the American Dream. Trump Campaign is All-In on the Network State cult True, Kamala Harris has not proposed the creation of bizarre new cities through some kind of gameshow competition. For one thing, it's not clear why such cities are needed – unless, of course, you are familiar with one of the stranger ideas floating around certain tech circles these days. The Network State cult, a frequent subject of this newsletter, calls for the creation of private cities ruled by non-democratic tech governments. ""Freedom Cities"" seems like a slight Republican rebranding of the concept. The adoption of the idea suggests that Trump's team – which announced the plan last year – has been searching for ways to align with Weird Tech for quite some time. Many news outlets wrote about Trump's plan for new cities in 2023, but I can't find one that mentions the term Network State. It's likely that reporters were totally unaware of the concept back in 2023. But in 2024, the idea deserves a fresh look because the same people behind these proposed Network State cities are putting all of their money behind Trump's campaign. Network State in a nutshell To recap: The Network State cult calls for the creation of new tech-controlled sovereign cities that would essentially act as miniature countries. These independent territories can be created in one of two ways. The first is called Voice . This route entails using the political system to take over existing city governments through elections. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan is currently trying the ""voice"" method in San Francisco, where he is spearheading a tech-funded campaign to capture control of City Hall. (How do I know this is a Network State project? Because Tan has described his project as such.) The second method is called Exit. The ""exit"" method involves finding a bare piece of land that can be built up into a new tech city, ideally with tax breaks or other exemptions from ""host governments."" Próspera , on the island of Roatan in Honduras, is an example of this: a tech-run Special Economic Zone where certain rules don't apply. Próspera has become a mecca for unregulated gene therapy experiments. And then there's our local version: California Forever. This proposed tech city in Solano County was supposed to go to voters for approval on November's ballot, but it has been delayed due to massive community opposition. California Forever denies being a Network State project, but Andreessen is one of its investors. In addition, Balaji Srinivasan – the main evangelist of the Network State idea – has strongly suggested that California Forever is a Network State project . (Note: Srinivasan has clearly derived his ideas from J.D. Vance associate Curtis Yarvin , who calls these tech-governed dictatorships ""patchworks"" or ""realms"" rather than network states.) This is an important detail because Andreessen, Srinivasan and Thiel are working closely together to make the Network State a reality. Pronomos: A Network State Company These three even have an entire company dedicated to building such cities around the world. Pronomos VC promises to build ""the cities of tomorrow"" with ""better laws"" for ""better lives."" Thiel and Andreessen are major funders of Pronomos, where Srinivasan is an advisor . Pronomos' founder is Patri Friedman, grandson of conservative economist Milton Friedman. From the company's website: Decades of research on economic development has shown that the primary determinant of prosperity is the quality of a country’s laws and the integrity of its courts, administrators, and other legal institutions. When institutions are outmoded, corrupted, or failing, the result is untold human suffering. Workers are trapped in low wage jobs and dangerous working environments, children don’t get educated, adults can’t get quality healthcare, and people can’t start businesses to support their families. Yet, upgrading national institutions is notoriously difficult, and consensus on country-level changes&nbsp; should &nbsp;be slow and deliberate. 'Freedom Cities' = Network State The basic idea – creating sovereign company cities with different laws to help a chosen few escape the problems of wider society – is clearly the same as Trump's little freedom cities. He announced the plan for these new cities as part of a ""quantum leap"" plan that also includes flying cars. This seems like a clear nod to the "" accelerationism "" movement sweeping certain parts of tech. Trump's inclusion of Network State ideas in his official campaign platform raises many questions: Who will live in these cities? How will they be governed? Who will profit most from their creation? How will they deal with fierce, bipartisan community resistance like that which derailed California Forever? Where is this ""American frontier"" of which Trump speaks? How did this strange and dystopian cult idea make its way into Trump's campaign platform?

Plus Follow See All by Gaby Del Valle is a policy reporter at The Verge covering surveillance, the Department of Homeland Security, and the tech-right. Antisemitic streamer, Holocaust denier, Charlottesville rally attendee, and January 6th instigator Nick Fuentes disavowed Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign last week, claiming the America First movement had been &ldquo;hijacked&rdquo; by &ldquo;consultants, lobbyists, & donors.&rdquo; The news that Fuentes had declared a &ldquo;groyper war&rdquo; on his preferred presidential candidate has sparked some claims that Trump is losing support among a core part of his constituency: white supremacists. But Fuentes has long been at odds with another subset of the far-right &mdash; one that has ascended within the mainstream Republican Party in recent years, culminating in Trump&rsquo;s selection of JD Vance as his running mate . In a video posted on Rumble, Fuentes said Trump had made &ldquo;an endless string of unforced errors&rdquo; in his campaign, beginning with Trump&rsquo;s suggestion that former candidate Nikki Haley could have a place in his administration. Fuentes also took issue with Trump&rsquo;s appearance on the All-In podcast , in which he said all foreign students who graduate from US colleges should get a green card along with their diploma. Among Fuentes&rsquo; other complaints was the fact that Trump has publicly distanced himself from Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s playbook for a second Trump term. Unmentioned in Fuentes&rsquo; video is his longstanding beef with far-right thinkers who have gained prominence within conservative circles, including Curtis Yarvin, a &ldquo;neo-reactionary&rdquo; philosopher who is close with Vance and megadonor Peter Thiel. Fuentes, a vocal antisemite, has accused Yarvin of believing that &ldquo;non-Jews are incapable of governing themselves and therefore must always be ruled by Jews.&rdquo; He has also claimed that Yarvin and Costin Alamariu &mdash; the once-pseudonymous writer better known as Bronze Age Pervert &mdash; are &ldquo;at the forefront of a rising Thiel-funded faction of the Right.&rdquo; This subset of the far-right has been quietly gaining ground for years. In 2019, Politico Magazine reported that several young staffers of the Trump White House had become taken with Bronze Age Mindset , Alamariu&rsquo;s self-published, anti-egalitarian manifesto about how superior men suffer under the tyranny of the &ldquo;Leviathan&rdquo; (the government, elite cultural institutions, and so forth) and the hordes of &ldquo;bugmen&rdquo; (inferior beings who do the Leviathan&rsquo;s bidding) . Vance, incidentally, follows Bronze Age Pervert on X. Michael Anton, a Trump-era national security official, has described Bronze Age Pervert as speaking &ldquo;directly to a youthful dissatisfaction (especially among white males) with equality as propagandized and imposed in our day.&rdquo; In his review of Bronze Age Mindset, Anton notes that Yarvin gave him the book as a gift. Writer John Ganz has referred to the radicalization of young conservative staffers as a sort of &ldquo;groyperfication,&rdquo; and while there are certainly some influential Fuentes sympathizers within the Republican Party, Fuentes&rsquo; groypers are actually at war with BAP acolytes and Yarvin&rsquo;s so-called Dark Elves. The Thiel-funded faction of the right, as Fuentes put it, is now in power. Vance owes much of his political career to Thiel. Elon Musk was among those who convinced Trump to select Vance as his running mate, and Vance&rsquo;s addition to the ticket has brought in hundreds of millions in donations from other members of the Silicon Valley elite. Related Elon Musk and tech elite back a pro-Trump super PAC J.D. Vance is anti-Big Tech, pro-crypto Fuentes&rsquo; groyper war is really a war of optics. Trump&rsquo;s disavowal of Project 2025 is largely superficial; many of its policy proposals were written by former Trump staffers and current allies. Vance has not only echoed some of the proposals laid out in Project 2025 but also wrote the foreword for Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts&rsquo; forthcoming book Dawn&rsquo;s Early Light . But polling suggests that Project 2025 is becoming increasingly unpopular among voters &mdash; it&rsquo;s only logical that Trump has tried to tell voters he has nothing to do with it. Trump has, in fact, also attempted to distance himself from Fuentes. Trump had dinner with Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago in 2022 and &ldquo;seemed very taken&rdquo; with the young white supremacist, Axios reported at the time . (Fuentes had been invited by Kanye West shortly after the rapper legally changed his name to Ye.) But after Republican leaders criticized Trump for dining with Fuentes, Trump claimed he had no idea who Fuentes was. Vance, too, has recently been questioned about Trump&rsquo;s ties to Fuentes. Vance was asked about Fuentes&rsquo; dinner with Trump during an interview with ABC News on Sunday. &ldquo;The one &mdash; the one thing I like about Donald Trump, Jon, is that he actually will talk to anybody,&rdquo; Vance told ABC News&rsquo; Jonathan Karl. &ldquo;But just because you talk to somebody doesn&rsquo;t mean you endorse their views. And look, I mean Donald Trump spent a lot of quality time with my wife. Every time he sees her, he gives her a hug, tells her she&rsquo;s beautiful and jokes around with her a little bit.&rdquo; Fuentes, on the other hand, had said &ldquo;terrible stuff&rdquo; about Vance&rsquo;s wife, Usha. After Trump announced Vance as his running mate, Fuentes said Vance&rsquo;s interracial relationship was proof that he &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t value his racial identity,&rdquo; heritage, or religion. &ldquo;I mean, he&rsquo;s a white supremacist,&rdquo; Vance said. But unlike the other white supremacists in Trump&rsquo;s orbit, Fuentes doesn&rsquo;t couch his beliefs in cryptic diatribes about bugmen and elves. 0 Comments Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.

It’s the most meaningful milestone yet for Srinivasan’s dream of creating “network states,” which he defines as an internet community that secures a physical location and “gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states,” he wrote.&nbsp; The concept has enraptured the libertarian subsection of Silicon Valley; Srinivasan earned praise from Marc Andreessen and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and has inspired fellow crypto enthusiasts to start their own “network states.” In addition to his years at a16z, which ended in 2018, Srinivasan is also known for his year as Coinbase’s CTO after Coinbase bought his crypto startup Earn.com in 2018. And he’s a board member of the crypto nonprofit advocacy and lobbying organization Coin Center , which champions for policies like anonymity for crypto holders from the IRS. Srinivasan says his 90-day school will start in late September and will feature lectures on topics like digital nomadism while offering meals designed by longevity-obsessive Bryan Johnson, the entrepreneur who made headlines last year for spending millions on “de-aging” himself . The program, Srinivasan emphasized , is best suited for those who “understand that Bitcoin succeeds the Federal Reserve,” and “that AI can deliver better opinions than any Delaware magistrate” and “that democracy can be rejuvenated with cryptography.”&nbsp; Srinivasan, who published a book on network states in 2022, isn’t the only one making a play for internet-group sovereign nations. Last spring, Buterin created his own Srinivasan-inspired “network state” called Zuzalu in Montenegro. Guests included the musician Grimes and Patri Friedman, the entrepreneur who got millions from Peter Thiel to start a sea-bound society. For two months, attendees donned continuous glucose monitors, took daily cold plunges in the Adriatic Sea and attended lectures on everything from sex work to zero-knowledge cryptography.&nbsp; Although Srinivasan hasn’t divulged his plans for establishing a permanent presence on the island, the goal of network states is often to secure some recognition from local governments — whether that’s in the form of full sovereignty or a special economic zone. Zuzalu organizers met with Montenegro officials to discuss “creating a similar long-term home for pro-longevity devotees,” according to the MIT Technology Review ; another network state, Prospera, backed by Friedman, successfully lobbied Honduras for an economic zone that offers companies low taxes and startup-friendly regulations. Srinivasan is currently taking applications for his new network school, although he cautions that those with a fondness for the current world order need not apply. “The more respect you have for legacy institutions, and the more respect they have for you, the less suitable you’ll be as an applicant,” he wrote.

Andreessen, the cofounder of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, is one of several Silicon Valley bigwigs trying to build a new city on rural farmland in Solano County. The California Forever project was delayed at least two years in July after it faced stiff resistance from local residents. Meanwhile, an LLC operated by Andreessen’s wife, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, and brother-in-law, John Arrillaga Jr, owns three tracts of land totaling about 730 acres within a few miles of California Forever’s holdings, according to records obtained by TechCrunch . 4 Marc Andreessen has helped to bankroll the California Forever city project. Steve Jennings The project was already in development in 2015 – two years before California Forever began buying up huge tracts of land in the area – and does not appear to be affiliated. The land was reportedly first acquired in 1985 by the siblings’ real estate tycoon father, the late John Arrillaga Sr., and his partner Richard Peery. The LLC, called A&amp;P Children Investments, is plotting a mixed-use development that will include more than 1,000 homes on a parcel of land in the nearby city of Vacaville, California. During a local city council meeting in April, a representative for A&amp;P Children reportedly said the development was a “visionary” housing project.

Brun added that the project would not “have the issues you’ve had in the past.” Andreessen and Arrillaga Jr. could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. 4 Solano County residents have been wary of the California Forever Project. Getty Images A California Forever spokesperson told the outlet that its leaders “never made an offer” to buy the land – and had already begun buying land in the area for years before learning Andreessen’s family owned the parcels. “We were not aware that the Arrillaga and Peery families owned any land in Solano County until about two years ago, when we were already five years into the project,” the spokesperson said. California Forever’s billionaire backers, including Andreessen, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Steve Jobs’ widow, businesswoman Laurene Powell Jobs, have been quiet about their involvement since they were revealed as having bankrolled nearly $1 billion in stealthy land purchases in Solano County. 4 California Forever&#8217;s backers have pitched the project as a walkable, affordable city. California Forever The project’s CEO Jan Sramek has pitched California Forever to locals as a walkable city that would solve problems plaguing the state, such housing costs, punishing work commutes and environmental crises. Sramek and his associates had planned to seek approval for the city through a ballot measure in November, but placed it on hold pending the outcome of environmental impact studies. Local lawmakers and residents have been critical of tactics employed by California Forever in its push to build the city, with one resident once likening Sramek to a “snake oil salesman” during a heated town hall meeting 4 California Forever recently agreed to delay its plans for at least two years. California Forever “Delaying the vote gives everyone a chance to pause and work together, which is what is needed — not a fight between friends throughout the County on both sides of the issue,”&nbsp; according to a joint statement by the county and California Forever.

JD Vance struck a chord with Pennsylvania voters Wednesday when he touched on a topic that impacts millions of American families: drug addiction – which his mother battled when he was younger. Many in attendance at Vance&#8217;s campaign stop in the city of Erie told The Post they&#8217;re glad former President Donald Trump chose Vance as his vice presidential running mate because he can empathize with the struggles their families face. Political support in Erie County is paramount as it&#8217;s considered a battleground county in the state. 4 Sen. JD Vance speaks at a rally at trucking company Team Hardinger on Aug. 28, 2024, in Erie, Pennsylvania. Getty Images “I have two brothers who died of opioids,” said Mary Doyle, 63 and a stay-at-home mom from the city of Erie. “I know people in our neighborhood who have kids, they’re dropping like flies.” “We saw Mary’s brother two years ago in a body bag. Opioids. Fentanyl poisoning. And nobody talks about it,” her husband Dan Doyle, a fracker who opened for Vance, added.

Trump talks about it. You don’t see the Dems talking about it.” She plans to vote for Donald Trump a third time this November, and is glad Vance is on the Republican ticket. Vance’s New York Times bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy put him on the map in 2016. It describes how he overcame the violence and instability of growing up with a single mother addicted to opioids in Middletown, Ohio. 4 A rallygoer holds a copy of Vance&#8217;s New York Times bestselling memoir &#8220;Hillbilly Elegy.&#8221; Ethan Dodd for New York Post His mother is now 10 years sober, Vance said last month at the Republican National Convention. Chris Knight, 68, brought a hard copy of Vance&#8217;s book to the event and said her daughter struggled with heroin for years and “now helps other people so they don’t go down this path.” They’re both big Vance fans. “I can relate to him so well.

Erie County now has fewer jobs and residents today than it did in 2001, according to the Washington Post. Vance blamed the consensus to offshore manufacturing and the “stupid policies of Kamala Harris.”&nbsp; “The number one issue when I go to places like Erie, Pennsylvania is inflation,” he said. “The number two issue is why did Kamala Harris open up the southern border and let these cartels bring in the poison that&#8217;s killing our families?” Mary agreed: “The border is open. They just let it flow across.” Deaths due to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids more than doubled since 2020, when the pandemic hit. 4 Political support in Erie County is paramount as it&#8217;s considered a battleground county in the state. Getty Images The Biden-Harris administration spent more on treatment and prevention rather than stemming the supply of drugs while illegal border crossings from Mexico, from which cartels smuggle fentanyl into the US, reached an all-time high in December 2023. Under Trump’s plan for mass deportation, Vance promised Erie, “You&#8217;re gonna have fewer people dying of drug overdoses, you&#8217;re gonna have fewer people who are suffering.” See Also Swing States 2024 Trump gets the better of Harris in expansive swing-state poll — but he&#8217;s not helping Republicans downballot Erie County, which went for Trump in 2016 and narrowly for Biden in 2020, had the highest rate of opioid overdoses and second-most accidental drug deaths in 2023 among all of Pennsylvania’s counties. 90% of those 122 drug-related deaths were attributable to fentanyl. One day in June saw seven overdose deaths – in six hours . “This is opioid central,” Mary said. “People have lost their jobs and the kids don’t have any hope.” “Kids are scared,” said her daughter Maria Doyle, who’s 16 and a sophomore in high school. Her twin sister Elena added, “It is laced everywhere.” Young people, especially college students, “take a pill to stay up late to study and then they die,” Maria said. “That’s happened to our neighbor.” They said that the Republican Party has trouble reaching younger voters like them, and that Vance could change that. 4 Vance said that Erie reminds him of where he grew up. “This is a beautiful place” with a “proud manufacturing tradition” that “has been left behind.”&nbsp; Getty Images “I can’t see [Trump] in my shoes at all. I can’t understand how to be him because he’s so rich. JD Vance understands it more,” Elena said. Not only is he younger, but “his background story is also really inspiring to all of us – that everyone has a chance.” Maria chimed in: “Anyone can relate to him.” They saw the Hillbilly Elegy movie just the other day. “He’s kind of like a hillbilly like in his movie,” Maria said. “He understands addiction.” “The whole Republican Party is changing, and we’re addressing the opioid problem,” their mom said. “Now the Democrats are the elitists and the Republicans have become the working man.” Though Vance polls almost 10% more unfavorable than favorable, the twins agreed he was the future of the Republican Party.&nbsp; “He has a lot of time left,” Elena said with a laugh. “He’s forty years old.” Filed under 2024 presidential election donald trump JD Vance republicans Swing States 2024 vice presidents 8/29/24 Read Next Rep.

Balaji Srinivasan Says Cloud Real Estate is Next For Solana,Blockhead,20/09/2024,https://www.blockhead.co/2024/09/20/balaji-srinivasan-says-cloud-real-estate-is-next-for-solana-2/,"Balaji Srinivasan Says Cloud Real Estate is Next For Solana Skip to content Dark Search Sign In Subscribe Latest Featured brn Newsletters About Blockcast BlockHouse Reports News — balaji srinivasan — Solana — Breakpoint — Tokenization Balaji Srinivasan Says Cloud Real Estate is Next for Solana Balaji Srinivasan tells the Solana Breakpoint audience in Singapore about how the blockchain needs to make a shift towards cloud real estate ,&nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp; Blockhead 20 September 2024 . 3:00 PM 2 min read 𝕏 Share on Facebook Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp Share via Email Table of Contents Former Coinbase CTO, Balaji Srinivasan , took to the stage to kick off Solana Breakpoint . With Token2049 closing its doors the day before, Solana Breakpoint welcomed the global Solana community to its two-day event on Friday in Singapore, after previous editions in Amsterdam in 2023, and Lisbon in 2022. Speaking in a fireside chat with Raj Gokal, co-founder of Solana and COO of Solana Labs, Srinivasan discussed his views on the Solana Network State. Describing Solana as an ""important infrastructure,"" Srinivasan said the community needs to focus on ""quantifying decentralisation."" He suggested that between tier 1 and tier 2 there are other states, and that just as cloud curriences reflect fiat currencies, cloud countries could reflect real-world real estate, population, and annual income. ""If you created an NFT that proved how much real estate there was and you set up a proof-of-space NFT, it could give you the footprint of a digitalized decentralised real estate,"" he cited as an example. While Srinivasan praised Solana for ""solving problems on the blockchain"" he said it has yet to ""wade into non-blockchain technology."" ""The technology, capital, and population are there,"" he said. ""But we can have polarising views of what a society should be."" He further explained that crypto serves as parallel finance to fiat. ""Crypto is parallel finance, acknowledging that fiat fundamentally flawed and we're going to fix it by inverting it."" ""Decentralisation is good and inflation is bad - both are inverted in crypto,"" he said. The Network State, which is defined as a ""highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states,"" is essentially about real estate, Srinivasan argued. The Network School, which Srinivasan set up near Singapore last month to ""articulate a vision of peace, trade, internationalism, and technology,"" is also designed to build up other tech communities, he said. ""We only broadcast something if it's scaling up to 10s of thousands,"" Srinivasan said. ""as we scale up we will put everything we can on open state and open source."" Srinivasan then likened Solana's ideology vector to the sorting hat from Harry Potter. ""We ask polarising questions like 'what's your position on nuclear power?' and from that set up mini cities,"" he explained. Recalling lockdowns during the COVID pandemic, Srinivasan said the world ""flipped to an internet-first world and the physical world came second."" He praised Solana for being well positioned for it. Further building on digital society, Srinivasan said that ""once you have accounting on-chain, you can have an on-chain SEC. If you have an SEC you can have on chain investment etc."" In particular, Srinivasan said Solana can help smaller countries. ""Big chains and small countries can do amazing deals together,"" he said. ""We can give them the followers and capital they don't have but they have institutional soverignty license."" Join Blockhead today for FREE and stay in the loop on digital assets!

The still-quiet project surfaced in a new profile of Ive, who is best known for working with late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs on many of company’s most iconic product designs, including the iPhone. Ive founded the design firm LoveFrom in 2019 after leaving Apple. During a meeting at the Michelin-starred San Francisco restaurant Spruce last year, Ive and Altman discussed “how generative A.I. made it possible to create a new computing device,” according to the New York Times , which interviewed Ive for the article. 4 Jony Ive (center) is best known for working closely with Apple&#8217;s Steve Jobs. Getty Images for Vox Media Details on the device itself remain scant, though Ive and Altman reportedly discussed how it would be able to perform advanced tasks, such as booking travel or identifying a specific plant from a photo, that exceeded the capabilities of traditional smartphones. The Times said early concepts for the device call for an AI-centric device that is “less socially disruptive than the iPhone,” though it remains unclear if it will be a rival smartphone or tablet.

Chesky is known to be a close friend of Altman. After several more meetings, Ive and Altman reportedly decided to pursue the project, with LoveFrom coming aboard to design the device and OpenAI providing the software. 4 Altman and Ive are seeking ways to harness AI in a new device. AP The project has already raised money from Ive himself as well as Jobs’ widow Laurene Powell Jobs, a prominent venture capitalist who invested through her company Emerson Collective, according to The Times. In total, the startup could raise up to $1 billion from unnamed “tech investors” by the end of the year, the newspaper said, though it’s unclear who else may be involved. Ive has reportedly hired about 10 employees and spent $60 million on office space in a space neighboring LoveFrom’s headquarters in San Francisco. OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment. 4 Jony Ive (left) has reportedly purchased $90 million in real estate in San Francisco. Dave Benett/Getty Images for Cartier Initial hires include Tang Tan, a former Apple executive who led the teams responsible for designing the iPhone and Apple Watch before being poached last December , and Evans Hankey, who succeeded Ive as Apple’s top designer before leaving in 2023. The Ive-Altman project was first reported by The Information in September 2023. At the time, the outlet reported that Japanese investment firm SoftBank and its famous chief Masayoshi Son had participated in early talks . The profile revealed other details about the reclusive Ive’s recent activities, including the revelation that he has purchased roughly half a city block’s worth of real estate in the Jackson Square area of downtown San Francisco. 4 Sam Altman (right) is CEO of OpenAI. REUTERS Ive has reportedly spent nearly $90 million of his personal fortune on the real estate deals since 2020. The tech executive told The Times that he was planning the area as a hub to attract creatives in San Francisco after many left the city during the COVID-19 pandemic. A major renovation for the buildings is set to be completed late next year. The headquarters of LoveFrom and the still-unnamed AI hardware startup are located in buildings he purchased.

A ‘Groyper War’ struggles to exert influence but paves the way for other bad actors 23 September 2024 By: Jared Holt and Nathan Doctor White nationalist influencer Nicholas Fuentes and his loyal fanbase have tried to pressure Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign with blasts of online propaganda. They may have violated social media platform policies in the process, but platforms have not taken action against them. The sense of impunity for crude platform manipulation may encourage others to try similar tactics. Nicholas Fuentes, an influential white nationalist podcaster and activist, vowed last month that he and his “ Groyper ” followers would oppose former President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign until their policy and personnel demands were met. So far, that opposition has taken the form of a social media pressure campaign that may have violated at least one social media platform’s policies against manipulation tactics and inauthentic behaviors. During the August 12 episode of his America First podcast, Fuentes officially declared a “Groyper War” against the Trump campaign. He instructed his fringe but devoted fanbase to use social media to pummel the campaign with criticisms and demands. He also said he was prepared to mobilize his followers at offline events across the country. Fuentes explained his antagonism was not because he was opposed to Trump’s candidacy, but in fact because he was so interested in its success. Fuentes’ war on the Trump campaign was prefaced by a set of demands. These included pushing Trump to adopt extreme policies on immigration, to promise not to go to war with Iran, and to remove campaign managers Christopher LaCivita and Susie Willes (who Fuentes alleged had softened Trump’s public policy stances). If the campaign did what he asked, Fuentes said, it would escape a self-inflicted “death spiral” that would otherwise deliver the presidency to Vice President Kamala Harris. This is the second such “Groyper War” directed by Fuentes. In 2019, he picked a similar fight against the conservative activist group Turning Point USA (TPUSA). Fuentes’ followers antagonized TPUSA speakers online and at public events, and many Groypers at the time declared triumph against the activist group. Although this campaign set its aims higher in attempting to foment turmoil at the top of the GOP ticket, it has shown few, if any, political results. Republican vice-presidential nominee, Senator JD Vance, called Fuentes a “ total loser ” shortly after Fuentes first teased a second Groyper War. Rather than fire Willes and LaCivita, Trump has instead lavished praise on the campaign managers. Fuentes dubiously took credit for the campaign’s decision to hire longtime Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski despite a lack of evidence that the choice had any connection with Fuentes’ activity. Although Groypers were successful in securing national media attention for Fuentes, coverage of their efforts has been fleeting. Fuentes’ efforts to elicit the attention of sympathetic conservative influencers such as Candace Owens were similarly temporary. Seemingly frustrated by the limited responses to their endeavors, the Groypers are now looking to escalate their activities offline. A heavy but brief online offensive In the first phase of the second Groyper War, Fuentes instructed his followers to share criticisms of the Trump campaign on social media platforms X and Truth Social, and to boost messages that Fuentes posted. His fans obliged. Fuentes’ tactics were crude but effective. As X owner Elon Musk and Trump were speaking in a live interview last month, the white nationalist activist directed thousands of viewers on a concurrent Rumble livestream to post specific phrases on X and “juice” posts he made on his own profile. In one case, Fuentes noted he was about to send an anti-immigration post and provided explicit instructions for his fans to flood it with engagement. “It’s going to be in Donald Trump’s replies,” Fuentes explained to viewers. “We need likes, retweets, quote tweets, replies … This is where it begins.” That post alone received more than 52,000 engagements and was Fuentes’ second most engaged post since he was allowed back on X in May (he was previously banned in 2021 for multiple violations against content rules, and he remains banned from most other major social media platforms). As the event went on, Fuentes promoted four phrases for his followers to spread: “NO MORE IMMIGRATION”, “FIRE LACIVITA”, “ISRAEL FIRST ADELSON” and “NO WAR WITH IRAN.” The spread of these phrases sometimes corresponded with topics of conversation between Musk and Trump. An analysis using Brandwatch found that mentions of the four phrases on X spiked dramatically in sync with Fuentes’ instructions on the concurrent livestream. His fans created thousands of posts – often within just a few minutes – after which usage of the phrases steeply dropped. &nbsp; The surges were enough to trigger X to display some of them as trending topics: a fleeting accomplishment celebrated by Fuentes and his fans. Figure 2: Trending phrases at different points during the interview. In the week following Musk and Trump’s discussion, a Brandwatch analysis found that the four phrases Fuentes promoted to his fans appeared in more than 136,436 X posts. Though not all posts should be attributed solely to Fuentes’ fans, the number dwarfs the 9,445 X posts mentioning the phrases from the previous week on the platform, and the 2,719 X posts that appeared the week before that one. While the surge was profound, it was also short-lived. Between August 19 and 25, the week following the campaign’s peak, only 4,844 X posts mentioned the phrases. Since then, the number of appearances per day has declined further. Only 48 X posts mentioning the phrases were counted on September 8. Fuentes and his fans’ tactics extended beyond X. Early in the second Groyper War, supporters shared a graphic boasting that Groypers had created “thousands” of accounts on Truth Social and shared more than 30,000 posts in support of their effort. C ommitted followers sought to recruit multimedia creators to make Groyper War propaganda, some of which has been shared by Fuentes on his accounts. Other methods took fiercer aim at Trump’s campaign staff. Fuentes’ political non-profit America First Foundation created a website under campaign manager LaCivita’s name. The website was meant to disparage LaCivita and promote questions about his pro-Trump loyalties. Several Fuentes fans also claimed that they sent Trump campaign staffers emails expressing their criticisms of the campaign. Though the Groypers displayed clear abilities to spin up high volumes of social media posts, the changes they demanded did not materialize. During the August 26 edition of his podcast, Fuentes appeared to concede that their efforts on social media had ultimately been unsuccessful. That night, he announced the next offensive: Confronting the Trump campaign offline in Michigan. “They didn’t hear us on Twitter,” Fuentes said. “They didn’t hear us on Truth Social. They just censored the hashtags. They didn’t hear us when we emailed them. And they didn’t hear us when The Washington Post and every other news media outlet reported it. So, now we’re going to travel to Michigan, and we will say it to their faces with a crowd of actual America Firsters.” At the time of writing, Fuentes’ plans in Michigan are unclear. He attracted hundreds of Groypers to a conference in Detroit, Michigan, earlier this year. Though the Groypers lost their venue shortly before it was set to begin, it demonstrated Fuentes’ abilities to mobilize his fanbase. Platforms took no apparent enforcement actions against the Groyper War Tactics used by Fuentes and his followers on social media, namely the creation of accounts to engage in an influence campaign, meet traditional definitions of “ coordinated inauthentic behavior , ” a term used to describe manipulative tactics that blend “authentic, fake and duplicated social media accounts to operate as an adversarial network” on social media platforms. Platforms including Meta and X/Twitter have previously taken enforcement actions against such campaigns, but Fuentes’ Groyper War appears to have so far evaded scrutiny. Other bad actors, like hostile states seeking to influence US politics from afar, are certain to take note of the relative ease that the Groypers have experienced in conducting an influence operation on both major and fringe platforms. They could consider it when shaping their own efforts. Groypers have shared material instructing each other to register Truth Social accounts for the second Groyper War and boasted that they did so in the “thousands.” That push, and their subsequent efforts to manipulate the platform’s Trending feature, could be interpreted as running afoul of Truth Social’s terms of service . Fuentes&#8217; followers have not made similarly explicit claims about their activity on X, and a review of 50 accounts that shared the highest quantity of posts with Groyper War phrases found that only five were created in August 2024 – potentially for the influence campaign. Still, X should explore the extent to which similar tactics were used on its platform. A key difference between the Groyper War and other coordinated inauthentic behavior campaigns launched by hostile states is that authentic influencers, like Fuentes, are involved. The Groyper War can reach far more people online than most foreign influence campaigns because Fuentes can amplify and agitate key messages. Though as evidenced by a recent indictment alleging Russian propagandists laundered millions through a handful of pro-Trump social media stars, foreign adversaries have grown wiser to the value that authentic influencers can offer them. Regardless of any potential success Fuentes may claim from the current Groyper War, the campaign has succeeded in establishing his narratives among national news media, bolstering perceptions of his influence in politics and creating perceived pressures at the top of a major political party. Several major news outlets published stories reporting that far-right influencers were turning on Trump, highlighting Fuentes as a key example. Other bad actors, like hostile states seeking to influence US politics from afar, are certain to take note of the relative ease that the Groypers have experienced in conducting an influence operation on both major and fringe platforms. They could consider it when shaping their own efforts. Conclusion Fuentes is likely to escalate his attempts to earn attention and influence from Trump’s presidential campaign in online and offline venues. But even if the second Groyper War has failed to produce its desired results, it has already demonstrated how vulnerable some social media platforms are to crude, manipulative tactics that create distorted perceptions of influence. As Groypers turn their focus to offline actions in Michigan, they leave behind a blueprint for other bad actors to replicate and a clear case study for scrutinizing platform policy enforcement. A campaign by these other actors could yield better results, provided they have more modest ambitions and more sustained focus than the Groypers.

His book on democracy, The Reactionary Spirit , was published 0n July 16. You can purchase it here. There is one thing Donald Trump’s critics and fans can agree on: He is not an intellectual. His politics come from the gut, a combination of his own instincts and an animalistic talent for reading his supporters’ emotions and enthusiasms. The idea that Trump is attuned to the debates roiling conservative intellectuals — arguments about Hungarian family policy and concepts with names like “postliberalism” — doesn’t pass the laugh test. Yet in Trump’s first term, his intellectual incuriosity opened up a curious avenue for ideas to matter. With the president in his own world, various senior staffers had the ability to build little fiefdoms, each working to turn their own beliefs into official US policy. In the past, that often meant old-school Republicans obstructing Trump or even slipping their own policies in under his nose . Related Trump’s Russia policy is an incoherent mess A second term would likely be different. Since 2020, Trump has purged much of the Republican old guard. Trump-aligned institutions like the Heritage Foundation have put together vast lists of loyal staff who can come in on day one. A second Trump term would likely be a self-consciously revolutionary project: one in which Trump-aligned ideologues work to turn vague outlines of Trumpism into a governing doctrine. With Trump-aligned ideologues running the show in the White House, the ideological debates inside the Trump movement would be far more than a matter of intellectual curiosity. The ideas that have captured the MAGA world’s imagination could well be shaping the future of the United States — and quite possibly the world. The six thinkers below have developed some of these influential ideas. Their worldviews are diverse and heterodox, advancing political visions that sound extreme or even outlandish. One is a Silicon Valley monarchist blogger, another a retired Harvard professor who writes on the virtues of “manliness.” A third is a deceased proponent of state-run economies. Despite their differences, it is impossible to understand the modern Trump-aligned right without appreciating their influence. Studying them closely will do more than clarify what the MAGA movement wants in the abstract; it will help us think through what its return to power might mean for all of us. Patrick Deneen, the regime changer In May 2023, now-vice presidential nominee JD Vance appeared at a book event in Washington for Patrick Deneen , a conservative political theorist at the University of Notre Dame. The book, Regime Change , received an enthusiastic response from the panel; Vance told the audience that he viewed his political mission as “explicitly anti-regime.” But what does that mean, exactly? To understand, it’s worth looking at Deneen’s ideas — and the broader “postliberal” movement he belongs to. Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) greets University of Notre Dame professor of political science Patrick Deneen before a panel discussion on regime change and the future of liberalism at Catholic University in Washington, DC, on May 17, 2023. Associated Press Deneen’s first big book, Why Liberalism Failed , argued that the shared philosophy of the American center — a liberalism focused on rights and individual freedom — had produced a miserable world. While claiming to liberate people to pursue their own life plan, liberalism in fact cut them off from traditional sources of community and stability. Americans were depressed, lonely, and immiserated — and they had their governing consensus to blame. After the book’s success, Deneen would become a leader in the emerging “postliberal” movement: a heavily-Catholic group of conservative scholars developing a political vision of an America beyond liberalism. Their basic idea is abandoning liberalism’s core commitment to neutrality about the good life and instead proposing a politics in which the US government uses policy to foster Christian virtue among its citizens. Different postliberals have different ideas of what that looks like. Adrian Vermeule, a Harvard law professor, argues for integralism — an old Catholic idea that essentially merges elements of the Church into the state. Other postliberals, like Gladden Pappin and Rod Dreher, have become champions of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s vision of “illiberal democracy” — literally taking posts in Budapest at government-aligned institutions. Deneen’s own path to postliberalism, presented in Regime Change , is, well, regime change: “the peaceful but vigorous overthrow of a corrupt and corrupting liberal ruling class and the creation of a postliberal order in which existing political forms can remain in place, as long as a fundamentally different ethos informs those institutions and the personnel who populate key offices and positions.” Related What a new conservative call for “regime change” in America reveals about the culture war On its face, this is an exceptionally radical proposition. It would require, at minimum, hollowing out the US government by replacing most of its key leadership with dedicated postliberals. These people would then use their posts from within to promote a conservative Christian vision for governance without formally changing the foundations of the American system — in effect, a quiet, invisible overthrow of the government. When Vance declares himself to be a “ postliberal ” with “explicitly anti-regime” politics, this is the cause to which he’s dedicating himself. But what does that look like in more concrete terms? In Regime Change , Deneen himself doesn’t match his radical rhetoric with radical policy . Most of the specific ideas presented in the book are either widely discussed among the American elite (like national service for teens) or already implemented (like tariffs aimed to improve domestic manufacturing). Those handful that are truly radical tend to be unconstitutional (a total ban on pornography) or narrowly focused on higher education. So, for the most part, Deneen’s work shouldn’t be seen as a policy guide for a second Trump term. However, it can be seen as an inspiration for how some of its top officials see their jobs. Talk of an evil “regime” in Washington is now widespread on the intellectual right; Vance and other like-minded Trump officials will see their task in the second term as moving against it. Their task of rooting out the “deep state” is not merely revenge against Trump’s enemies but a revolutionary Christian act of laying the groundwork for a postliberal America. James Burnham, prophet of “managerialism” Silicon Valley is typically seen as a place obsessed with the new. But in the tech conservative set likely to influence a second Trump term — people like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel — there’s recently been a renewed interest in a 1941 book by conservative intellectual James Burnham . The book, titled The Managerial Revolution , prefigured the current right’s concerns about “wokeness” conquering the American business world. Despite a series of almost comically wrong predictions, it remains an important guide to how a second Trump term might conceive of its role in waging culture war. Lume Books Burnham’s book predicts a world defined by class war between the capitalist and “managerial” classes (the proletariat, in his view, are too weak and disorganized to seize power). He defines the managerial class as the people who supervise the key functions of a modern economy: “operating executives, superintendents, administrative engineers, supervisory technicians; or, in government ... administrators, commissioners, bureau heads, and so on.” Related The 80-year-old book that explains Elon Musk and tech’s new right-wing tilt In Burnham’s view, a complex modern economy inevitably directs power away from capitalists and toward managers. Because the managers actually understand and direct the technical tasks involved in modern corporate life, they truly control the means of production. Their nominal bosses, the capitalists, only owe their power to little pieces of paper calling them owners; the managers can, and almost certainly will, figure out some way to seize full control. This, for Burnham, meant a future of state-controlled economies. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union would prove that state-controlled industry, where managers didn’t have to deal with capitalist overlords, would be so efficient that they’d consign democratic capitalism to history’s dustbin. Today, we know Burnham’s predictions were wrong in basically every particular. So why his enduring influence on the right, and especially those conservatives in tech — the sector that singlehandedly has proven that technical experts can become capitalist titans? The answer is the culture war. Silicon Valley’s conservative CEOs and venture capitalists often have to deal with an employee base with radically different politics. While these tech leaders may be all-in on Trump, your average engineer or programmer is much like other college-educated American urbanites: very liberal . Feeling besieged and hemmed in by their own employees, tech conservatives see Burnham as a prophet of their lived experience. “Most woke ‘labor’ scandals in tech are an entitled middle-management class at odds with founders.” writes Antonio García Martínez , an influential tech conservative. “What Elon is doing [at X] is a revolt by entrepreneurial capital against the professional-managerial class regime that otherwise everywhere dominates (including and especially large tech companies).” Inasmuch as the tech conservative sector wields influence in a second Trump term, we should expect a good chunk of their efforts to be directed along Burnhamite lines. They will want the administration’s assistance not only in slashing taxes and regulations but in ensuring their own control over unruly “woke” employees. Curtis Yarvin, the monarchist Curtis Yarvin, a blogger also known by the pen name “Mencius Moldbug,” fuses many of the traits of our first two entries. Like Deneen, Yarvin believes that the liberal American “regime” must be overthrown. He has also been cited by JD Vance as an influence — specifically on the question of seizing control over executive branch staff . And like Burnham, an avowed influence on his thought , Yarvin believes that society is defined by a struggle for power between competing elite groups. Yarvin is likewise widely influential among tech conservatives — he is, in fact, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur himself . Curtis Yarvin. David Merfield But unlike either of them, Yarvin has advanced a clear vision for what 21st century America should look like. Democracy, he believes, should be toppled — replaced instead with a new kind of corporate monarchy. Related Curtis Yarvin wants American democracy toppled. He has some prominent Republican fans. “A well-managed enterprise hires the right people, spends the right amount of money on them, and makes sure they do the right things. How do we achieve effective management? We know one simple way: find the right person, and put him or her in charge,” he writes . In Yarvin’s view, the United States has approximated this system under three presidents: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Because the country was either young or in crisis, these leaders wielded extraordinary amounts of power — which Yarvin believes was mistakenly taken from our chief executives. “These three Presidents, and to some extent a few more, were almost true CEOs of the executive branch. Their monarchical regimes then decayed into oligarchies, each of which was rebooted by the next monarchy. By the clock, we are about due for another,” he writes. Naturally, Yarvin has implied that Trump might be the man to turn the clock forward. In an interview with Michael Anton, a former senior official in the Trump National Security Council, Yarvin mused about the mechanics of a Caesarist takeover by Trump . This includes setting up an app, “the Trump app,” designed to get millions of supporters out into the streets to support a series of swiftly executed power grabs. At other times, however, Yarvin has expressed skepticism that Trump has the chops to execute this kind of audacious authoritarian coup. “He is who he is. His capacities are what they are,” Yarvin mused resignedly in a 2022 essay . In his mind, someone like Elon Musk would be a better choice for dictator/CEO. Yarvin’s not wrong about Trump’s unserviceability. Nothing that happened between 2017 and 2021 suggests that Trump would be able to competently execute the sort of swift and total fascist coup Yarvin envisions. But Yarvin’s work is still important for understanding how far a second Trump term might go. Here is a person who is openly musing about destroying democracy and who has built up a fan base among people like Vance and Anton in Trump’s immediate orbit because of this work. You can hear echoes of his generalized contempt for democracy in the litany of actual antidemocratic policies being contemplated in a second Trump term . Harvey Mansfield, student of manliness No discussion of intellectual influences on Trump’s second term is complete without a discussion of gender. It’s a topic that, as Vance’s pronouncements about “childless cat ladies” illustrate, has become increasingly central to the modern right’s ideology — and one where the right is rapidly evolving in a more radical direction. And when it comes to gender politics, few on the right command the intellectual influence of Harvey Manfield — a nonagenarian political theorist who recently retired from Harvard. Harvey Mansfield. Boston Globe via Getty Images During his 61-year tenure at America’s most famous college, Mansfield became a conservative institution unto himself: a beachhead in enemy-occupied territory, an Ivy Leaguer who has been mentor to some of the movement’s leading lights. His former graduate students include Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), leading pro-Trump intellectual Charles Kesler , and the famous Never Trump writer Bill Kristol. Mansfield, an erudite Tocqueville scholar, disdains Trump — describing him as a demagogue and a vulgarian . Yet in a recent interview , Mansfield said he voted for said vulgarian in 2020 “with many misgivings” (Mansfield adds that he “crossed [Trump] off [his] list entirely” after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot). Related The intellectual case for Trump: A debate He has offered striking praise of Trump in one area: gender. Trump, he said in one interview , was “really the first American politician” to win office via “a display of manliness and an attack on political correctness.” He beat Hillary Clinton, per Mansfield, because American elections are “tests of manliness” — and “it’s difficult for a woman to do that in a graceful way, and to maintain her femininity.” Mansfield’s 2006 book Manliness attacks what he sees as the end goal of modern feminism — a “gender-neutral society” — as willful denial of reality. Enduring inequalities, like women’s disproportionate share of home labor, reflect not discrimination but rather the essential influence of “manliness” on men. Manliness, in his account, is a kind of self-reliant commanding decisiveness — a willingness to blaze a risky path and lead others along it. While women can be manly — Mansfield cites Margaret Thatcher as an example — they generally are not. For Mansfield, “common sense” stereotypes about men and women are mostly true and validated by the evidence. “Women still rather like housework, changing diapers, and manly men. The capacities and inclinations of the sexes do not differ exactly or universally, but they do seem to differ,” he writes. Mansfield here is giving voice to a bedrock conservative belief that the gender binary is an essential component of human nature. Men are generally one way and women are generally another; this, for conservatives, is an eternal truth about humanity that liberals deny at their peril. This idea doesn’t just shape the way that conservatives think about feminism: It is also central to the way they approach trans issues. So much of conservative rhetoric on the topic is about insisting on the illegitimacy of trans identity and being infuriated that they are now “expected to call a man a woman” because trans people complicated the division between what Mansfield calls the enduring “capacities and inclinations of the sexes.” If we want to understand how a second Trump term will approach hot-button issues surrounding gender, there are few clearer animating spirits than Mansfield-style insistence on the truth of the gender binary — and anger at the ways in which “gender-neutral society” devalues traditional manliness. Christopher Caldwell, the ethnic majoritarian Christopher Caldwell is perhaps the most highbrow right-wing populist in American media today. A New York Times opinion contributor with a literary profile — he is, among other things, on the editorial committee of a prominent French intellectual journal — few have been as successful at bringing Trump-friendly arguments to liberalism’s salons. Overall, Caldwell’s oeuvre is the mirror image of Yarvin’s. While Yarvin advances an openly antidemocratic rule by an elite minority, Caldwell has built an argument for unfettered majority rule. Simon & Schuster In his most recent book, The Age of Entitlement , Caldwell argues that the 1964 Civil Rights Act is responsible for much of what right-wing Americans find baleful about American culture today (such as “wokeness”). He writes that white people “fell asleep thinking of themselves as the people who had built this country and woke up to find themselves occupying the bottom rung of an official hierarchy of races.” This idea, that America is now a society that formally discriminates against white people, is a major influence on the Trumpist right today. Stephen Miller, Trump’s immigration czar and leading adviser, has founded a law firm — America First Legal — that has dedicated much of its efforts to filing suits alleging anti-white discrimination. If elected, a Trump administration would almost certainly attempt to revamp civil rights law to center this alleged scourge . Of course, Caldwell hardly invented the idea of “reverse discrimination.” But he did break new ground in explicitly linking the problem to the very idea of federal civil rights protections itself, suggesting ( albeit not outright owning ) a radical remedy to the problem. This is especially important in light of his praise for elected authoritarians abroad. In my book The Reactionary Spirit , I looked at three examples of foreign heads of state who have taken a hammer to the democracies they govern: Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, and Narendra Modi in India. In each case, the evidence of their antidemocratic bent is damning, ranging from systematic attacks on the freedom of the press to attempts to undermine the independence of election administration officials and the judiciary. Related How white victimhood is shaping a second Trump term Caldwell has written essays defending each of these leaders from charges of authoritarianism. His work reads like prestige feature journalism but is weak on the merits — ignoring contradictory evidence to the point of dishonesty . What Caldwell seems to admire in these leaders is their ability to turn visions of right-wing ethnonationalist government into reality. He describes them (often misleadingly) as the voices of the true majority, fighting a decadent left that had been imposing its will on an unwilling populace for too long. This core commitment to ethnic majoritarianism is what links his work on foreign governments to his critique of the Civil Rights Act — and what makes Caldwell so important for understanding a second Trump term. He is hostile to civil rights law, and friendly to foreign ethnonationalists, because he believes that there is something fundamentally undemocratic about the enterprise of legally protecting minority rights. “We … like to pretend that protecting minorities always means protecting them against abuse and persecution by majorities. Sometimes it does. But just as often it means claiming prerogatives for minorities against the innocent preferences of democratic majorities,” he writes in his essay on Modi . This spells out, perhaps more clearly than Caldwell intended, the vision of “democracy” that animates Trumpism: The strong do what they will, and the weak suffer what they must. Elbridge Colby, the China hawk Since World War II, American foreign policy has centered around maintaining its core alliances in Europe. We all know that Donald Trump has little interest in keeping those in good shape. But what would a more Trumpy alternative look like? Elbridge Colby, one of the brightest young(er) lights of the GOP foreign policy establishment, has a clear answer: Put fighting China at the top of the to-do list. Elbridge Colby. Dominic Gwinn/AFP via Getty Images In his 2021 book The Strategy of Denial , Colby argues that the rise of China has fundamentally changed the nature of international politics. Because of China’s extraordinary size and rapidly advancing armed forces, it poses a geostrategic threat to the United States unlike that of any state in recent memory. Were China to fully displace America as the dominant power in East Asia, Colby writes, it would be a dire threat to “Americans’ security, freedom, and prosperity.” In his view, Beijing aspires to attain dominance by exerting effective control over nearby states — beginning with Taiwan but expanding outward from there. The only way to stop China from doing so is to invest massive amounts of resources in the region, enough to prevent it from believing that it has a chance of simply running over its neighbors with relative ease. Colby’s “strategy of denial” depends on America being selective. In his view, China is so strong that the US must scale down its commitments elsewhere in order to concentrate all attention where it really matters. “Its first, overriding priority must be an effective defense of allies in Asia against China,” he writes. And, as such, “the United States should seek to have European states assume the greater role in NATO.” This worldview has made Colby into one of the most articulate skeptics about America’s ongoing commitment to Ukraine. Every dollar the United States spends on helping the Ukrainian war effort is a dollar less for helping Taiwan prepare to fight a Chinese invasion. We need to avoid “getting bogged down in Europe,” as he put it in a Fox News appearance, and begin pivoting to Taiwan. Colby has real pull in the GOP: He served in Trump’s first-term Department of Defense and, per Politico, currently has Vance’s ear . And his worldview is consistent with Trump’s on more than just Europe. Related The far left and far right agree on Donald Trump’s foreign policy legacy. They’re both wrong. One of the great misapprehensions about the former president is that he is an isolationist or even a critic of American empire. Neither is true : Trump used force aggressively during his first term, but did so less in the name of “protecting democracy” or other such lofty goals than in favor of American interests narrowly construed. In service of this vision, his administration oversaw bombings in Iraq and Syria that killed thousands of civilians. The Trumpian critique has never been that America should voluntarily weaken its military or retreat from the world. Rather, it’s that the United States should focus on its own interests, eschewing any of this “rules-based order” nonsense in favor of taking what’s ours. In that general sense, Trump and Colby are a perfect fit. But it’s less clear whether Trump shares Colby’s assessment of China as a military threat. As much as he loves to complain about Chinese trade practices, Trump has also repeatedly expressed admiration for President Xi Jinping — an admiration the Chinese have built up through aggressive flattery . So while Colby’s ideas are almost certain to play some role in shaping a second Trump term, there is a real question over whether they’ll play a dominant one.

Vance’s America: The Road to Authoritarian Rule TheIntellectualist October 8, 2024 0 Comments J.D. Vance: The Architect of America&#8217;s Fortress J.D. Vance enters the political sphere wrapped in the garb of a populist hero, a self-proclaimed defender of Appalachia’s forgotten people. But beneath this carefully curated image lies a far darker reality. Vance, backed by Silicon Valley’s libertarian elite like Peter Thiel and guided by intellectuals like Curtis Yarvin, is the architect of a new American order—one where democracy fades into irrelevance, and power is concentrated within the walls of an insulated fortress. His rise signals not just a shift in political power, but the deliberate dismantling of democratic principles that once stood as the foundation of the republic. Vance’s America isn’t one of hope and opportunity; it’s a fortress built brick by brick, policy by policy, with each new decision further entrenching the elite in their seats of power. In this fortress, the voices of the people are muted, their concerns drowned out by the hum of machinery built to sustain the few at the expense of the many. Each promise Vance makes—whether to Appalachian workers or American voters—is just another stone in this growing edifice, one designed to stand impervious to scrutiny, dissent, or accountability. This isn’t democracy as we know it. This is a slow erosion, a quiet coup, where democratic norms are hollowed out from the inside. Like the fortresses of old, Vance’s vision of America is designed not to protect the people but to isolate those in power, shielding them from the consequences of their decisions. Each alliance he forges, whether with Thiel or Yarvin, serves to strengthen the walls of this fortress, making it harder and harder for the public to reclaim the levers of power. Betrayal in Appalachia Yet, behind these grand political moves lie the shattered hopes of real people—the workers who believed in AppHarvest’s promises, only to find themselves abandoned. For the people of Appalachia, who have spent generations fighting for economic survival, AppHarvest was more than just a company—it was a lifeline. Vance, ever the populist in rhetoric, aligned himself with the project, selling the vision of sustainable jobs and a revitalized economy. But as the company grew, its promises withered, and local workers, once assured of steady employment, were replaced by out-of-state labor brought in for efficiency. For those who had invested their hopes in Vance and AppHarvest, the betrayal was profound. These workers, who had believed they were part of something bigger, found themselves on the outside looking in, as the very jobs they were promised were handed to transient workers with no stake in the future of the region. The company’s financial struggles and eventual layoffs only deepened the disillusionment, exposing the gap between Vance’s populist rhetoric and the cold, corporate reality of his alliances. This, of course, is the central contradiction of J.D. Vance’s political persona. While he publicly champions the working class, positioning himself as a defender of “real Americans,” his real-world decisions consistently favor corporate interests and the consolidation of elite power. The fallout from AppHarvest is not an anomaly—it is a reflection of the larger pattern that defines Vance’s career. His alliance with Peter Thiel and other Silicon Valley elites underscores his commitment not to the people of Appalachia, but to a small, insulated class of technocrats and venture capitalists who see democracy as an obstacle to be overcome rather than a system to be preserved. The Thiel Connection Central to Vance’s rise is his deep relationship with Peter Thiel, whose $15 million investment in Vance’s Senate campaign represents more than just financial backing—it’s the underwriting of a shared vision. Thiel, who famously stated, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” embodies a radical form of libertarianism that seeks to dismantle democratic governance and replace it with a technocratic elite. His vision of the future, where decisions are made in corporate boardrooms far from the reach of democratic oversight, finds fertile ground in Vance’s rhetoric and policy positions. The ideological foundation of this movement is rooted in the &#8220;Dark Enlightenment,&#8221; a term coined by Curtis Yarvin, one of Vance’s intellectual influences. Yarvin’s ideas, which advocate for a “CEO-like” leader who wields unchecked power, align perfectly with Thiel’s vision of governance. In this worldview, democracy is seen as inefficient, a relic of the past that must be replaced by a system that prioritizes order, control, and the authority of a technocratic elite. Vance’s public statements, including his calls to “replace civil servants with our people,” mirror this dangerous philosophy, suggesting that his rise to power is less about reform and more about replacing democracy with something darker. Digital Fortresses: Rumble and Disinformation Vance’s vision isn’t confined to the physical structures of governance—it extends into the digital sphere, where platforms like Rumble serve as the battleground for ideological warfare. Billed as an alternative to Big Tech, Rumble, where Vance and Thiel have invested heavily, has become a haven for conspiracy theories, extremist ideologies, and misinformation. It’s a platform where the most dangerous elements of far-right ideology are amplified, providing a space for the anti-democratic rhetoric that underpins Vance’s political strategy. On Rumble, voices that challenge the legitimacy of elections, spread disinformation about vaccines, and promote the unraveling of democratic institutions are given free rein. The platform isn’t just a marketplace of ideas—it’s a breeding ground for a new political order, one where the norms of democracy are dismantled in favor of a system that rewards control and obedience. For Vance, Rumble is a tool of influence, a digital fortress where his ideas can thrive unchecked, shaping public discourse in ways that serve to further erode trust in democratic processes. Vance&#8217;s Views on Women: The Return to &#8220;Traditional Values&#8221; Moreover, Vance’s views on women reflect the same regressive tendencies that define his political philosophy. His harsh portrayal of his mother in Hillbilly Elegy —where he blames her addiction and instability for the family’s struggles—points to a broader disdain for women who don’t conform to his rigid vision of domesticity. His critiques of feminism, which he claims have “undermined family values,” echo the rhetoric of Phyllis Schlafly and the social conservatives of the 1970s, who argued that women’s liberation was destroying the American family. Vance’s nostalgia for traditional gender roles reveals a desire to turn back the clock on decades of progress. His opposition to reproductive rights, his calls for women to return to their roles as mothers and caretakers, and his dismissive attitude towards women’s autonomy suggest a worldview that is not only patriarchal but also deeply hostile to the idea of gender equality. In Vance’s America, women’s rights are secondary to the preservation of a moral order dictated by religious conservatism and enforced by the state. Fortress America: A Dystopian Vision As Vance’s political star rises, the fortress he builds becomes ever more imposing. His vision of America is not one of democracy, but of hierarchy—where the elite rule from insulated towers, far removed from the struggles of ordinary citizens. In this America, elections are little more than ceremonial gestures, designed to maintain the illusion of choice while power remains firmly concentrated in the hands of a technocratic elite. The institutions that once protected the rights of the people—courts, the press, and the civil service—are hollowed out, replaced by loyalists who serve the interests of the ruling class. The press, once a watchdog for democracy, is reduced to an arm of the state, echoing the narratives crafted within the walls of the fortress. Meanwhile, civil liberties are gradually eroded, with dissenters silenced and protests suppressed under the guise of maintaining “order” and “security.” The Dystopian Reality The parallels to dystopian futures are undeniable. In Vance’s America, the rich live in insulated towers, far above the chaos of everyday life, while the rest of society fights for survival in a system rigged against them. These towers aren’t just physical—they are symbolic of the consolidation of power, where the elite, fortified by wealth and influence, control every aspect of society. Information, technology, even the flow of political power is concentrated in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of the population powerless to change their fate. This isn’t the democracy of Lincoln or Roosevelt. It is a future where freedom is sacrificed for the sake of order, where equality is abandoned in favor of control. The technocratic elite, with Vance at their helm, dictate the terms of governance, free from the constraints of democratic accountability. And the people, shut out of the decision-making process, are left to watch from the outside as their rights and liberties are slowly stripped away. Closing Thought As Vance rises, the fortress he builds looms larger with each passing day. The question now is not whether democracy can survive, but whether we still have the will to fight for it. The walls of this fortress are not built overnight, nor are they built in secret. They rise brick by brick, as the democratic institutions we once trusted are dismantled piece by piece. The longer we wait, the higher these walls grow, and the harder it becomes to tear them down. Do we still have the courage to dismantle these walls before they become impenetrable? Or are we watching, in real-time, the slow and deliberate end of American democracy? Works Cited Barnes, J. E. (2024, September 13).

Have an account? Log in . Geoffrey Hinton isn't a fan of Sam Altman's leadership. Hinton said in a press conference on Tuesday that he thought Altman valued profits over safety. The OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, Hinton's protégé, played a key role in Altman's brief ouster. The newly minted Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton says he's proud that one of his former students had a part to play in Sam Altman 's brief ouster from OpenAI in November. Hinton, who was awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in physics on Tuesday, was speaking at a press conference on the same day when he weighed in on Altman and OpenAI . ""I'm particularly proud of the fact that one of my students fired Sam Altman,"" Hinton said, referencing his protégé and OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever . Sutskever graduated with his doctorate in computer science from the University of Toronto in 2013. Hinton was Sutskever's doctoral supervisor. ""So OpenAI was set up with a big emphasis on safety. Its primary objective was to develop artificial general intelligence and ensure that it was safe,"" Hinton said on Tuesday. ""And over time, it turned out that Sam Altman was much less concerned with safety than with profits. And I think that's unfortunate,"" he added. Hinton told Nikkei Asia in an interview published in March that he thought Sutskever had foresight in recognizing AI's potential — and its dangers. ""In 2012, it still seemed that these digital intelligences were not nearly as good as people. They might be able to get about the same as people at recognizing objects and images, but at that time we didn't think they'd be able to deal with language and understanding complicated things,"" Hinton said. ""Ilya changed his mind before me. It turned out he was right,"" he added. Sutskever left OpenAI in May , just months after OpenAI's board moved to fire Altman as CEO. On November 17, 2023, the company's board said in a statement that it was removing Altman because he ""was not consistently candid in his communications with the board."" The board, however, didn't give further details about Altman's firing. Sutskever, who cofounded OpenAI with Altman, later expressed regret for his decision to fire Altman. He joined other employees in calling for Altman's reinstatement. Following his departure, Sutskever said in June that he was starting a new AI company , Safe Superintelligence Inc. Representatives for Altman at OpenAI, Hinton, and Sutskever at Safe Superintelligence Inc. didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours. Hinton, who's known as the ""godfather of AI"" for his pioneering work in neural networks, has long warned about AI's dangers. During an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" which aired in October 2023, Hinton said it was possible that AI could eventually manipulate humans . ""They will be able to manipulate people, right?"" Hinton told ""60 Minutes."" ""And these will be very good at convincing people because they'll have learned from all the novels that were ever written — all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they'll know all that stuff. They'll know how to do it,"" he continued. When approached for comment about the interview, Hinton told BI's Jordan Hart that it could take between five and 20 years before AI became a real threat. Hinton also said that ""it is still possible that the threat will not materialize."" To be sure, Hinton isn't the only one who has questioned Altman's leadership of OpenAI. Under Altman, OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, is set to transition into a for-profit company within the next two years. Elon Musk , Altman's fellow cofounder turned rival, has repeatedly criticized him since Musk left the company's board in 2018. ""OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it 'Open' AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,"" Musk wrote in an X post in February 2023. ""Not what I intended at all,"" Musk added. Read next Sam Altman OpenAI Recommended video This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Imagine if a small group of billionaires and political influencers wanted to reshape America by abandoning democracy. That’s exactly what people like Curtis Yarvin, JD Vance, and Peter Thiel are working toward . Known as a leader in “neo-reactionary” thought, Curtis Yarvin advocates for a government that looks more like a monarchy or dictatorship—where one person, almost like a CEO, makes all the decisions. This might sound like a far-fetched idea, but with tech billionaires funding political candidates like JD Vance, these views are getting dangerously close to becoming mainstream. Who Is Curtis Yarvin? Curtis Yarvin, also known by the pen name “Mencius Moldbug,” is a controversial figure in political philosophy and tech. Recognized as a founder of the “neo-reactionary” (NRx) movement, Yarvin challenges liberal democracy and supports hierarchical, authoritarian governance. Yarvin believes democracies are outdated and ineffective. His solution? Replace democracy with an authoritarian “monarchy” or corporate structure where the country is ruled more like a business. He sees American institutions like universities and media as “cathedrals” that shape public opinion too much. His controversial ideas have captured the attention of right-wing tech billionaires like Peter Thiel. Peter Theil’s Role in this Threat to Democracy Peter Thiel is a billionaire investor and tech entrepreneur who was originally from Germany but is now an American citizen. He’s best known as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook. Over the years, Thiel has used his wealth to influence American politics, and he’s become a significant supporter of politicians who share his distrust of democracy . His views are rooted in a belief that true freedom means a few powerful people should make decisions instead of relying on a democratic system where people vote and influence the government. Thiel has even said he believes “freedom and democracy are incompatible,” He thinks democracy gets in the way of true freedom, especially for people with wealth and power. Theil uses his wealth to undermine democracy. With his significant influence, Thiel has funded politicians like JD Vance, who agree with these ideas. In 2022, Thiel spent $15 million helping Vance win his Senate race in Ohio. Now, with Vance as Donald Trump’s running mate, Thiel’s influence could reach even further if Trump wins. Thiel’s financial support isn’t limited to Vance; he also backs other politicians who share a vision of America as less democratic and more controlled by a few powerful figures, much like a corporation. Theil uses his influence to showcase an anarchist. Thiel has also raised the profile of Curtis Yarvin, a writer with controversial ideas about government. Yarvin argues that democracy is ineffective and supports the idea of a strong leader—like a “CEO of America”—with unchecked power. Thiel’s network, sometimes called the “Thielverse,” includes influential tech figures like Elon Musk, who also share a skeptical view of democracy. By supporting Yarvin and his projects, Thiel has helped bring these authoritarian ideas out of the shadows and into public conversation. Theil leans on his friends who share his desire to “rule the world.” Elon Musk, a billionaire tech mogul originally from South Africa and now a U.S. citizen, plays a key role in amplifying anti-democratic ideas and funding the political push to reduce democratic checks in the U.S. Musk shares some of the authoritarian-leaning views of Peter Thiel and JD Vance and has recently donated substantially to political groups supporting Trump. Musk’s support aligns him with Thiel’s circle, where a few influential figures back candidates and policies to limit public influence over government in favor of centralized control. Musk’s influence is particularly powerful because he owns X (formerly Twitter), where he has allowed and promoted voices that align with anti-democratic or authoritarian ideas. By controlling such a large social media platform, Musk has reshaped public conversations on democracy, freedom of speech, and government accountability. Under his management, X has become a platform for conservative and right-leaning views, making it a tool to reach millions with messaging that questions democratic norms. At the same time, Musk has also been a significant backer of pro-Trump initiatives, committing millions to Trump-aligned Super PACs as the election approaches. This funding boosts campaigns and initiatives like Project 2025, which aims to restructure the government by firing many public servants and empowering the president with fewer constraints. With Musk’s support, these ideas gain traction and resources, helping them reach a larger audience and potentially influencing policy changes if they take hold. Thiel’s latest political effort is Project 2025, which decapitates our Federal government. Project 2025 is a plan to reshape the government by firing many experienced civil servants and giving the president more unchecked power. This project aligns with Yarvin’s “RAGE” idea, which stands for “Retire All Government Employees.” If Project 2025 happens, it will give leaders more control over the government, making it function more like a company where a single person, like a CEO, makes major decisions. Through his wealth and influence, Thiel is shaping a movement that aims to give more power to a few, reducing the role of the public in deciding the country’s direction. Why Should Regular, Democracy-Loving Americans Worry? Yarvin’s ideas, once dismissed as extremist, are now influencing mainstream politics because powerful men like Vance, Theil, and Musk share them. Vance’s proposed “purge” of government workers and disregard for election results show a willingness to abandon democratic principles for power. The idea of a “late republic” or “end of the republic” means they believe America is in its last days as a democracy. This movement envisions that after democracy collapses, a strong leader will rise to take control. This isn’t just political theory; these actions and ideas could fundamentally alter American society. Curtis Yarvin’s Anti-Democracy Push &#8211; Philosophical Roots and Views Yarvin started a political movement called “neoreaction” in the late 2000s. This movement is skeptical of democracy and supports the idea of an authoritarian government, where power is centralized under a strong, efficient ruler—similar to a monarch. Yarvin believes traditional values and strong, centralized leadership will lead to a more stable society. Instead of allowing public votes and debates to guide decisions, neoreactionaries argue that an efficient leader should be in charge, making choices for the country without public approval. Yarvin criticizes democracy, comparing it to a computer that constantly malfunctions. He argues that democratic systems often lead to corruption, waste, and poor decision-making. According to him, democracy is too messy and inefficient, and he believes that a centralized, corporate-style government—run by an executive with total authority—would be more effective. He believes that this structure could avoid the problems he sees in democracy, where public opinion and elected officials can lead to what he considers poor or misguided choices. Through his blog “Unqualified Reservations,” Yarvin has shared his criticism of “contemporary liberalism.” He argues that this form of liberalism has become almost like a religion, guiding and controlling public opinion in the West. Using historical examples, Yarvin tries to show what he believes are the failures and dangers of democracy and liberal values. His ideas have attracted attention from those who feel that traditional democratic systems no longer work effectively, and they have influenced certain circles within the tech industry and beyond. Curtis Yarvin’s Anti-Democracy Push &#8211; Influence and Notoriety Yarvin’s ideas, though extreme, have gained surprising attention in Silicon Valley. Some tech figures, including influential investors like Peter Thiel, have shown interest in his views. Yarvin’s arguments align with certain tech-libertarian beliefs, which often criticize government regulations and suggest that technology-driven governance models could be more efficient. This connection has helped Yarvin’s ideas find a foothold among tech leaders open to questioning traditional political structures. Yarvin is also linked to a broader online movement called the “ Dark Enlightenment .” This movement promotes a return to a traditional hierarchy, arguing that society functions better when led by elites rather than by egalitarian democratic processes. Through his writing and influence, Yarvin has become a central figure rallying people skeptical of progressive values and feeling that democratic systems may not best fit modern society. Curtis Yarvin’s Anti-Democracy Push &#8211; Controversies and Criticism Yarvin has faced considerable criticism for promoting views that many consider both racist and undemocratic. His advocacy for a society structured in strict hierarchies, with clear divisions between social classes and races, has led some to accuse him of endorsing white supremacy and social inequality. In his blog Unqualified Reservations , Yarvin discussed race in ways that reinforced stereotypes, including claims about racial differences in intelligence. These comments have sparked backlash, with critics arguing that his work undermines the principles of equality and justice. Mainstream media coverage of Yarvin’s ideas has generally been negative, reflecting his controversial and polarizing views. While he has developed a niche following online, many consider his theories extreme and out of touch with contemporary social norms around race, equality, and democratic governance. As a result, Yarvin remains a fringe intellectual whose ideas are largely rejected by the broader public, even as they attract interest within certain circles of tech and libertarian thought. Curtis Yarvin’s Recent Developments and Projects Yarvin has kept his ideas in circulation as a political commentator, especially during political crises or intense divisions. He argues that chaotic events, like the Capitol riots, reveal the weaknesses of democratic governance and the need for a more stable, centralized form of leadership. By interpreting these moments as proof of democracy’s flaws, Yarvin tries to make a case for his alternative vision of government. Through his blog and his recent platform, Gray Mirror (his Substack), Yarvin continues connecting with followers who are open to questioning mainstream political beliefs. These platforms allow him to advocate for his anti-democratic and hierarchical ideas, creating a community of readers who are curious about alternatives to liberal democracy and who share a skepticism toward the current political system. Yarvin’s presence is highly polarizing, yet his influence has grown within certain tech and internet circles, where some find his critique of democracy intriguing. Despite remaining a fringe figure, his ideas appeal to those who question the efficiency and stability of modern liberal democracy, adding to his relevance in these niche communities. JD Vance Activates the Yarvin Agenda with a Peter Theil Assist JD Vance, backed by Thiel’s millions, is not just any politician . Thiel and other influential tech figures see him as a leader who could transform America into the authoritarian state Yarvin imagines . JD Vance has become one of the most vocal proponents of ideas that could drastically alter the structure of American democracy, openly supporting plans to purge the federal government of long-term civil servants and replace them with loyalists. He likens this to “ de-Baathification ,” a program once used in Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein’s party members from government, intending to create a government staffed only by those aligned with his political ideology. For Vance, this approach is seen as a way to uproot what he describes as a deeply ingrained “establishment” within the federal system, which he and his allies believe opposes their vision for the country. Vance’s endorsement of Project 2025 takes this agenda even further. This radical plan, crafted by conservative think tanks and backed by figures like Peter Thiel, proposes a sweeping restructuring of the federal government if Trump is re-elected. Project 2025 would involve firing thousands of career government employees and overhauling agencies to remove protections that ensure non-partisan work within the civil service. Watch the Facebook video of Vance on Project 2025. Supporters of Project 2025 view it as a way to permanently transform the government’s structure, reducing regulatory power and concentrating authority in the hands of loyalists who align with their agenda. Critics warn that implementing such a plan would be a direct step toward authoritarianism, undermining the principles of neutrality and accountability within federal agencies and leaving the government vulnerable to partisanship and corruption. Vance’s alignment signals his commitment to fundamentally reshaping American democracy. By endorsing ideas that centralize power and dismiss career government employees, Vance is positioning himself as a leading figure in a movement that wants to dismantle traditional democratic safeguards. This shift could make the government less accountable to the people and more susceptible to authoritarian rule, with fewer checks and balances to prevent misuse of power. How Can We Protect Democracy? 1. Stay Informed Understand who these people are and why their ideas harm democracy. Sharing knowledge can prevent these ideas from gaining unchallenged support. 2. Support Institutions That Safeguard Democracy Institutions like fair media, independent courts, and civil rights organizations protect democratic norms. Advocating for their integrity is essential. 3. Promote Voting and Election Integrity Voting is one of the most vital ways to uphold democracy, but knowing the truth about election processes is equally critical to counteract misinformation. Recognizing and understanding the intentions of these influential figures can help us guard democracy, ensuring that authoritarianism doesn’t quietly slip in through the back door.

JD Vance thinks monarchists have some good ideas Comments Drawer Policy JD Vance thinks monarchists have some good ideas Taking inspiration from neoreactionary bloggers, Vance has suggested doing away with the federal bureaucracy. Taking inspiration from neoreactionary bloggers, Vance has suggested doing away with the federal bureaucracy. by Gaby Del Valle Oct 16, 2024, 8:50 PM UTC Link Facebook Threads Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Getty Images Gaby Del Valle is a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. JD Vance is, by his own admission, &ldquo;plugged into a lot of weird right-wing subcultures.&rdquo; His much-mocked comments about childless cat ladies and unassimilated Italian immigrants were made on a &ldquo;masculinist&rdquo; podcast. He doesn&rsquo;t eat seed oils , a dietary restriction du jour on the extremely online right. When he was nominated to be former President Donald Trump&rsquo;s running mate, his X following list included Bronze Age Pervert and Raw Egg Nationalist, two pseudonymous right-wing bodybuilders who often promote eugenics and the &ldquo;great replacement&rdquo; conspiracy theory . But perhaps no one online has shaped Vance&rsquo;s thinking more than the neoreactionary blogger Curtis Yarvin, a former programmer with ties to Vance&rsquo;s friend and benefactor Peter Thiel. Yarvin &mdash; who blogged under the name Mencius Moldbug in the aughts and is now on Substack &mdash; has been a far-right public intellectual of sorts for a long time. His oeuvre includes musings about the correlation between race and IQ, calls for a &ldquo;benevolent dictator&rdquo; to run the US, and posts like &ldquo;Why I Am Not A White Nationalist&rdquo; (because white nationalism is &ldquo;a very ineffective political device for solving the very real problems about which it complains&rdquo;). He once wrote that the neo-Nazi terrorist Anders Breivik, who killed dozens of people in a series of attacks in Oslo, Norway, was ineffective because he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t even make triple digits.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a tendency to not take people like Yarvin seriously. He and other far-right bloggers like Bronze Age Pervert position themselves as provocateurs and couch their work in absurd metaphors &mdash; it sounds inherently ridiculous to issue warnings about a guy who writes long essays about dark elves . And if you do take them seriously, they&rsquo;ll say they were just trolling. But if you look past his edgelord posture and baroque prose, Yarvin has spent the better part of a decade clearly describing what he wants: a dictatorship. Yarvin is most commonly associated with the neoreactionary movement, whose adherents believe &mdash; as Thiel wrote in 2009 &mdash; that freedom and democracy are incompatible and that democratic governments and bloated federal bureaucracies should be replaced by enlightened autocratic regimes. Until relatively recently, Yarvin&rsquo;s name was not brought up in mainstream political discourse. But his ideas about undercutting democratic checks on authoritarian power have struck a chord with the current Republican ticket. While Vance hasn&rsquo;t espoused Yarvin&rsquo;s more extreme ideas &mdash; and likely won&rsquo;t &mdash; he clearly holds parts of the neoreactionary creed in high regard. If you look past his edgelord posture and baroque prose, Yarvin has spent the better part of a decade clearly describing what he wants: a dictatorship In a July Substack post, Yarvin denied that he&rsquo;s had a &ldquo;significant influence&rdquo; on Vance. Yarvin referred to Vance as a &ldquo;random normie politician whom I&rsquo;ve barely even met .&rdquo; (He has a penchant for italics.) &ldquo;While I admire the senator and I think he has some potential,&rdquo; Yarvin wrote, &ldquo;he is hardly a &lsquo;friend&rsquo; of mine and I can&rsquo;t imagine I have influenced him.&rdquo; Years before he was the Republican vice presidential nominee, however, Vance openly touted that influence. &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s this guy Curtis Yarvin who has written about these things,&rdquo; Vance said on a right-wing podcast in 2021. Vance didn&rsquo;t stop at a simple name-drop. He went on to explain how former President Donald Trump should remake the federal bureaucracy if reelected. &ldquo;I think what Trump should do, if I was giving him one piece of advice: Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, and replace them with our people. And when the courts stop you, stand before the country and say, &lsquo;The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.&rsquo;&rdquo; This &ldquo;piece of advice&rdquo; is more or less identical to a proposal Yarvin floated around 2012: &ldquo;Retire All Government Employees,&rdquo; or RAGE. As described by Yarvin, RAGE&rsquo;s purpose is to &ldquo;reboot&rdquo; the government under an all-powerful executive, a sort of debugging. Yarvin sees elections as ineffective methods for political change because, while the head of state and their political appointees may change, the career bureaucrats (who, in Yarvin&rsquo;s view, are really calling the shots) stay put. &ldquo;If Americans want to change their government, they&rsquo;re going to have to get over their dictatorphobia,&rdquo; Yarvin said in the 2012 speech in which he described RAGE. Yarvin has since toned down the dictator rhetoric (he more recently called for a &ldquo;monarchy of everyone&rdquo;), but the underlying principle remains unchanged. For Yarvin, democracy is an illusion: elections make people think they have a say in what happens, but the Cathedral, his catchall term for journalistic institutions and elite universities, runs everything. Monarchy, in this theory, is the only honest government. RAGE bears obvious parallels to Trump&rsquo;s war against the &ldquo;deep state&rdquo; of federal bureaucrats. In October 2020, Trump signed an executive order that stripped employment protections from certain federal positions &ldquo;of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating chapter.&rdquo; Federal agencies would also be encouraged to hire staffers who pledged loyalty to the president. The new policy was called Schedule F, after the new employment category it would have created had Biden not canceled the order shortly after taking office. Schedule F was a radical idea cloaked in the sanitized language of the federal bureaucracy. Its goal was to concentrate power in the presidency and undercut what Trump (and others on the far right) refer to as the deep state and what Vance has repeatedly referred to as &ldquo;the regime.&rdquo; The regime goes beyond liberals or Democrats &mdash; it includes mainstream politicians from both parties whose primary goal is to uphold our current political order. Related The Springfield pet-eating hoax was not the only immigration lie Vance spouted during the debate JD Vance sells himself to Silicon Valley J.D. Vance is anti-Big Tech, pro-crypto Groyper war, dark elves, bugmen: how the GOP ticket is reviving far-right beef Yarvin&rsquo;s Cathedral takes this argument a step further, extending the cabal beyond Congress, the White House, and the courts; the media and elite universities are part of it, too. Where other right-wingers back efforts to take over universities and elite institutions and dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, Yarvin has written that these tactics will likely only &ldquo;reinforce progressive cultural power.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s kind of an all-or-nothing doomer; his ultimate vision is an American monarchy run by a &ldquo;national CEO,&rdquo; or in Yarvin&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;a dictator.&rdquo; (Trump, famously, has said he would not be a dictator in office &ldquo;except for day one.&rdquo;) And if Trump wins, Yarvin&rsquo;s RAGE proposal could be back on the table. Schedule F is among the dozens of policy proposals buried in the 2025 version of the Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s nearly 1,000-page Mandate for Leadership . If carried out, it could affect tens of thousands of federal employees. Schedule F is legally dubious, but as Politico has explained , the current makeup of the Supreme Court could allow for it to go forward anyway. If the courts don&rsquo;t side with Trump, Vance has suggested as recently as this year, he should proceed anyway. &ldquo;If the elected president says, &lsquo;I get to control the staff of my own government&rsquo; and the Supreme Court steps in and says &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not allowed to do that&rsquo; &mdash; like, that is the constitutional crisis. It&rsquo;s not whatever Trump or whoever else decides to do in response,&rdquo; Vance told Politico months before becoming Trump&rsquo;s vice presidential nominee. Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts sees the think tank&rsquo;s role as &ldquo;institutionalizing Trumpism&rdquo; and is a friend of Vance, whom he&rsquo;s referred to as &ldquo;one of the leaders &mdash; if not the leader &mdash; of our movement.&rdquo; Under Roberts, Heritage has shed its former identity as a home for free trade fanatics and Reagan Republicans and has fully leaned into an ultranationalist MAGA ethos. Vance wrote the foreword to Roberts&rsquo; book Dawn&rsquo;s Early Light , whose publication date was pushed back from September until November &mdash; after the election. Heritage isn&rsquo;t alone in this transformation. The right-wing think tank ecosystem has been completely remade in Trump&rsquo;s image since 2016. The far-right fringes have now taken over the mainstream, putting forth an exclusionary vision of America and who belongs in it &mdash; one in which nuclear families are led by an all-powerful executive who is accountable to nothing and no one. The Claremont Institute, once fairly traditional, is now the self-styled intellectual MAGA brain trust. Michael Anton, a former Trump administration official and Claremont fellow, wrote about Bronze Age Pervert&rsquo;s book for the Claremont Review of Books ; his review noted he had been gifted a copy by Yarvin. Yarvin is by no means Vance&rsquo;s only influence. As Politico &rsquo;s Ian Ward has written , Vance&rsquo;s worldview has been shaped by a variety of right-wing thinkers, including Catholic intellectual Patrick Deneen and French philosopher Ren&eacute; Girard, but it&rsquo;s also been affected by people like Thiel and Yarvin. If you strip away the veneer of respectability provided by Heritage and Claremont, the layers of irony behind which Yarvin hides his views, and the academic credentials of Vance&rsquo;s other influences, the extreme nature of their proposals becomes impossible to ignore. Vance is smart enough not to cite Yarvin in public now that he&rsquo;s the vice presidential nominee, and he hasn&rsquo;t publicly supported some of the blogger&rsquo;s more repugnant views. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s not plugged in.

Vance have a plan to unite with Trump's MAGA party and end democracy as we know it... Yes, that is the theme of this newsletter – and also the central point of a big New York Times Magazine story that published online today. It's a long read, but totally worth it. Gift Link: "" How Tech Billionaires Became the G.O.P.’s New Donor Class: Elon Musk and a group of Silicon Valley allies have built a shadow campaign to put Donald Trump back in office ."" From the story: As the internet blossomed, Thiel began to encourage a new set of even more provocative thinkers. At their center was an ex-programmer named Curtis Yarvin, who blogged under the nom de plume Mencius Moldbug, sketching out the framework for a nascent reactionary movement — later called the new right — aimed at deposing the cabal of liberal elites running the country. Yarvin saw democracy as a “destructive” form of government, instead proposing a techno-monarchy run by a national chief executive. Americans, he said, had to “get over their dictator phobia.” He and Thiel grew close; Yarvin stayed in Thiel’s homes, and they&nbsp; watched the 2016 election returns &nbsp;together. Further: As Thiel became wealthier and more powerful, he continued to help like-minded men accumulate their own wealth and power. They included a lot of Stanford Review alumni, like Josh Hawley, now the 44-year-old senator from Missouri, but also others who came to him via different routes — most prominently JD Vance, who has cited Yarvin as an influence himself. Vance reached out to Thiel after hearing him deliver a talk at Yale Law School, and following his graduation,&nbsp; Thiel helped set him up in Silicon Valley , first recommending him for a job at a biotech firm whose founder he was close with and later helping him raise $120 million for his own venture firm, Narya Capital. When Vance ran for Senate in 2022,&nbsp; Thiel was by far&nbsp; the biggest donor to his super PAC, giving $15 million. And here's the chilling conclusion about the twisted hopes of our would-be tech overlords... a terrifying vision of the future: They had big dreams and had made the calculus that Trump would create a more hospitable environment in which to realize them. They were going to plant devices in people’s brains, replace national currencies with unregulated digital tokens, replace generals with artificial intelligence systems and much more. If Trump wins with their help, the rise of tech fascism will turn out to be one of the more important stories in American history. Unfortunately, much of the mainstream press has been completely asleep at the wheel. So this story is a big step forward. Share it with every voter you know! More to come, soon.

Americans need to “get over their dictator phobia” – Valley Letter,Valley Letter,18/10/2024,https://valleyletter.com/americans-need-to-get-over-their-dictator-phobia/,"Americans need to “get over their dictator phobia” &#8211; Valley Letter About Advertise Challenging Valley Norms Dark Light Politics Tech Startups Finance Business Politics Americans need to “get over their dictator phobia” What Peter Thiel really thinks about democracy 6 mins read by Al Khan and Isabelle Fahey 18 October 2024 What Peter Thiel really thinks about democracy In the run-up to the 2024 election, we’re doing things a little differently here at Valley Letter. For the next six weeks, we’ll be diving into the political scene in Silicon Valley, exploring everything from alternative systems of government to specific policy pitches from the likes of Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, and Ben Horowitz. In a disillusioning two-party system, expand your mind with these bold ideas that cross party lines and question everything we think we know about politics in America. What do Napoleon, Julius Ceaser and Lenin all have in common? According to Peter Thiel favorite Curtis Yarvin, each would be preferable to Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, or any other democratically-elected leader. But let’s backtrack a little. It’s November 8, 2016, and 71 million households across the US are tuned in to watch the election results pour in. Peter Thiel has invited a friend over for a watch party – neo-reactionary, neo-libertarian, and neo-monarchist Curtis Yarvin. “I think my hangover lasted into Tuesday,” Yarvin says, recalling the evening. When asked about Peter Thiel’s political stance, he adds, “He’s fully enlightened, [he] just plays it very carefully.” What does enlightenment look like to Curtis Yarvin? Well, that’s complicated – but not for lack of documentation. Curtis Yarvin started blogging back in 2007, alongside his software engineering day job. Writing under the pseudonym ‘Mencius Moldbug’, Yarvin began posting on anti-democracy themes, with a focus on the decline of executive power and the rise of universities and the media. But his ideology offers a stance on basically every hot-button issue of the 21st century, from race and slavery to religion and Steve Jobs. But the part that’s caught the attention of the likes of Peter Thiel and GOP VP candidate JD Vance is his practically paint-by-numbers pitch for overthrowing democracy in America. It comes from his belief that America deserves something better: a leader with true executive power. But when did the presidency lose its bite? In some ways, it’s been baked into the system from day one. Since 2001, the US President has taken an average of 83 vacation days per year (in case you need a reminder, the average American gets 10). James Madison once took 4 months off in a row, and Theodore Roosevelt was frequently criticized for leaving Washington for months at a time. If a president can disappear for almost ¼ of each year, and the government still runs, who’s really calling the shots? The Monarch-CEO To return to our earlier thought experiment, Napoleon and Lenin are both examples of what Yarvin calls “a startup guy” – his ideal candidate for leader of the free world. The idea of a Silicon Valley or big business type being well-suited to the presidency is hardly original. It’s a core part of the New Right philosophy, which has come to power under the likes of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush and proposes that countries should be run as much like businesses as possible. Where Yarvin differs is his monarchic tendencies. In his 2008 book An Open Letter to Open-Minded Progressives, he says: “Was royalism a perfect system? It was not. But if we imagine a world in which the revolutions and civil wars of the last four centuries had never happened, it is hard not to imagine that world as happier, wealthier, freer, more civilized, and more pleasant.” It’s a bold claim – especially when many countries continue to be ruled or partially governed by a monarchy. Hypothetically, the US should be leagues behind the likes of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Monaco and Jordan in terms of happiness and personal freedoms, but you’d be hard-pressed to find an American who feels that way. Blake Masters, Peter Thiel’s protégé and general proponent of Curtis Yarvin, makes the same case: “For the record, I&#8217;m anti-monarchy. I&#8217;m very happy with the American Revolution. We threw off the tyranny of monarchy, right?” But Yarvin is convinced that America’s best bet is giving a single chosen candidate unchecked power, ‘restoring’ executive power to the presidency. So how would this America take shape? Abraham Lincoln led a coup against America Here’s another thought experiment: what do Napoleon, Hitler, Castro, and Lincoln all have in common? According to Yarvin, they all led coups. He argues that presidents like Lincoln and Roosevelt so exhaustively expanded presidential power that they can be said to have founded brand new regimes, effectively ‘seizing power’ from the established status quo. The examples of Lincoln and Roosevelt point to a further belief of Yarvin’s – that his Dictator-King-CEO could be appointed democratically. In fact, he argues that the candidate would campaign explicitly on that platform. He gives this as the basis for a hypothetical platform: “If I’m elected, I’m gonna assume absolute power in Washington and rebuild the government.” He has good reason to think this might work. According to Gallup, Americans’ faith in its institutions was at historical lows as of 2023, with Congress ranking dead last. We’re split almost 50/50 on whether the US has too much or too little involvement in our lives, and departments ranked lowest include the Federal Reserve, the IRS, and the DOJ. If the only thing Americans can agree on is that democracy is failing us, couldn’t the answer be no democracy at all? Rely on people power Simply electing someone on this platform does not automatically remove the barriers they would face once in office, from low-level bureaucrats all the way up to the Supreme Court. But Yarvin has a plan for that, too. First, the appointee would simply roll back Marbury v. Madison. Universally regarded as “the single most important decision in American constitutional law”, the 1801 case massively expanded the power and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, making them the defacto upholders of the Constitution. Theoretically, the new president would only have to declare the outcome false, and the Supreme Court rulings merely advisory. Of course, this would be met with huge resistance. But Yarvin has a solution for that, too – the power of the people. Yarvin describes a movement of people that “shouldn’t be menacing in this January 6 sense, [but that] should have this joyous sense that you’re actually winning and winning forever and the world is being completely remade.” RAGE The other way to ensure a smooth transition to the Monarch-CEO model has already made some headway in recent years. Back in 2020, Trump issued an executive order called “Schedule F” that reclassified 50,000 civil servant jobs as political appointees – meaning they could be fired and replaced whenever a new administration took over. Biden repealed the order, but it shows how easy it would be to completely shake up the bureaucratic system. That’s where RAGE comes in – an acronym for Remove All Government Employees. Current VP candidate J.D. Vance says that part of his advice for Trump’s second term would involve mass firings of federal employees, “and when the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did, and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’” Unlike libertarians, Yarvin doesn’t seem to believe in cutting down the total number of civil servant jobs. Instead, he recommends that his Monarch-CEO dedicate a lot of resources towards mobilizing his supporters to elect representatives hand-picked by the new leader. His idea is an app that would tell each supporter about any upcoming elections and the candidate that best aligns with the president’s views. After just one wave of elections (and with enough supporters), the president would encounter no real opposition. “Congratulations, you’ve turned the US into a parliamentary dictatorship,” Yarvin cheerfully summarizes. Peter Thiel: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” It’s a radical thought, from a radical essay called The Education of a Libertarian that Thiel wrote in 2009. “I have little hope that voting will make things better,” he explains, adding, “I believe that politics is way too intense. That’s why I’m a libertarian.” The essay even outlines three ways that a person might escape politics altogether: Cyberspace. Thiel questions whether a virtual world couldn’t one day become as real as the physical one, but free of politics. Outer space. “Because the vast reaches of outer space represent a limitless frontier, they also represent a limitless possibility for escape from world politics.” Seasteading. Thiel is confident that people will choose to live on the ocean to escape politics, as soon as the technology is feasible. Let’s go back to Yarvin’s 2016 description of Peter Thiel: “He’s fully enlightened, [he] just plays it very carefully.” Thiel has lost all faith in democracy as a vehicle for change. He is beyond Libertarianism – he sees small, insular communities without politics as the only path towards a world where “the choices of individuals may still be paramount, … [one] that some consider utopian.” So do Americans really need to “get over their dictator phobia” in order to build a society we can be proud of? Should we encourage one great “startup guy” to take on the presidency and shake things up from the inside, or should we all be looking into real estate on platforms somewhere in international waters? The US government is not working. We cannot become complacent about its dysfunction, and, in seeking to fix it, we should not be afraid of exploring even our most radical options.

The Technocratic Conspiracy: How tech tycoons plan to disrupt democracy ...,Daily Grail,20/10/2024,https://www.dailygrail.com/2024/10/the-technocratic-conspiracy-how-tech-tycoons-plan-to-disrupt-democracy-and-become-the-new-rulers-of-the-world/,"The Technocratic Conspiracy: How tech tycoons plan to disrupt democracy and become the new rulers of the world - The Daily Grail Click here to support the Daily Grail for as little as $US1 per month on Patreon Categories Alien Nation Art Computer Games Conspiranoia Cryptozoology Darklore Forteana Fresh Science Hidden History Humanity Plus Information Magick Circle Mind Mysteries Music Myths and Folklore News Briefs Religion &#038; Spirituality Sacred Sites Shamanism Skepticism Speculative Fiction Spirit World Straight Science TV and Movies Contact The Technocratic Conspiracy: How tech tycoons plan to disrupt democracy and become the new rulers of the world By Greg on Sunday, October 20th On July 25, 2024, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for the presidential election in the United States, selected as his running mate 39-year-old senator JD Vance. It was in some ways a strange pick: many believed Trump might need to pick a running mate who would appeal to some of the demographics he was himself not popular with, such as women and minorities. Instead, he chose Vance, a middle-aged white male with some extreme views about women and minorities, who came with very little political experience (having only been first elected to the US Senate in 2022), and who had only just a few years before made clear his disdain for Trump, suggesting that he might be &#8220;America&#8217;s Hitler&#8221;. However, once you start digging into why Vance might have been selected as Trump&#8217;s possible vice-president, and the people behind the push for him to be there, a whole landscape of weirdness comes into view &#8211; one inhabited by fringe political philosophies as well as some of the richest people to have ever walked the Earth. But if Trump manages to win the presidency in November 2024, those people and their fringe philosophy will soon enough be in control of the most powerful country on the planet, and could perhaps transform the world into something entirely new &#8211; but not for the better. The Technocrats On October 8, 1940 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested an individual, J.N. Haldeman, in Vancouver on a charge of &#8220; membership in an illegal organization &#8220;. The illegal organization that Haldeman was part of was &#8216;Technocracy Incorporated&#8217;, an influential faction of a larger ideology known as the technocracy movement . The movement, which rose in popularity during the 1930s, proposed that modern societies should bin representative democracy, and instead directly appoint scientists and engineers who would manage nations with rationality and technical expertise, which would supposedly lead to a new utopian age. One of the leading lights of the technocratic movement &#8211; and founder of the group Haldeman was a part of, Technocracy Incorporated &#8211; was engineer Howard Scott. His vision for technocracy &#8211; in the immediate aftermath of the Great Depression &#8211; included a major change to the way economies worked: At the core of Scott&#8217;s vision was &#8220;an energy theory of value&#8221;. Since the basic measure common to the production of all goods and services was energy, he reasoned &#8220;that the sole scientific foundation for the monetary system was also energy&#8221;, and that society could be designed more efficiently by using an energy metric instead of a monetary metric (energy certificates or &#8216;energy accounting&#8217;). Technocracy Inc. officials wore a uniform, consisting of a &#8220;well-tailored double-breasted suit, gray shirt, and blue necktie, with a monad insignia on the lapel&#8221;, and its members saluted Scott in public. However, the movement soon waned, not least due to its opposition to Canadian involvement in World War II. As a consequence, Technocracy Incorporated was declared an illegal organization, thus leading to the arrest of J.N. Haldeman, who was the head of the regional branch. Haldeman died in a plane crash in January 1974, just two and a half years after his daughter Maye had given birth to his grandson, Elon Musk. The PayPal Mafia Fast forward to 2024, and Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world (perhaps in all of human history) &#8211; worth around $240 billion at the time of writing &#8211; and heading up world-leading companies built on cutting edge science and engineering including Tesla, X (formerly Twitter), and SpaceX. He has also planted his flag firmly in the political camp of Donald Trump, openly endorsing him for president . And with his flag comes his rather plump piggy bank, offering head-spinning amounts of money to back the campaign. Well, at least if Trump does what Musk wants him to do . So it doesn&#8217;t seem coincidental that just a week after his endorsement, Musk &#8211; along with another billionaire, David Sacks &#8211; pushed for , and subsequently &#8216;received&#8217;, JD Vance as Trump&#8217;s vice-presidential candidate pick. This helps to explain the &#8216;weird&#8217; choice of Vance as his running mate &#8211; the Trump campaign had been running low on funds in the first half of the year, and then some &#8216;angel investors&#8217; from the tech industry offered access to their very, very deep pockets &#8211; on the condition that they got their man in the #2 position. Elon Musk and David Sacks both originally made their fortunes some 25 years ago through their involvement in the early years of the online payment website PayPal &#8211; along with a number of other individuals (many of whom are also now billionaires and still involved in the tech industry) who are often referred to collectively as the &#8216; PayPal Mafia &#8216;. Apart from Musk and Sacks, individuals from this group went on to found companies such as YouTube, LinkedIn and Yelp, as well as investing in fledgling companies that would go on to become corporate behemoths, such as Facebook. &#8216;Fortune&#8217; magazine group shot of some of the &#8216;Paypal Mafia&#8217; Perhaps the most important individual from the &#8216;PayPal Mafia&#8217; however, at least in terms of Vance&#8217;s selection as Trump&#8217;s running mate, is Peter Thiel (front left of the image above). Apart from his status within the PayPal mafia, Thiel also wields considerable influence as an early mentor to two wunderkind who now stand atop the technology ladder: Meta/Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and OpenAI founder Sam Altman. But it may be a third protege, JD Vance, that turns out to be Thiel&#8217;s trump card (no pun intended): because while Elon Musk and David Sacks may have been the ones that the media reported as pushing JD Vance to Trump, Peter Thiel metaphorically owns him . When Vance first announced his run for the U.S. Senate in 2022, Thiel dropped $10 million into a Super PAC supporting him, and also chaperoned Vance to a personal dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. But Thiel&#8217;s ties to Vance go much further back. In 2011, while a student at Yale Law School, Vance heard Thiel give a speech in which he called for smart young people to come work in tech, and was inspired enough to email him directly afterward ( in Vance&#8217;s words , Thiel&#8217;s speech was &#8220;the most significant moment of my time at Yale Law School&#8221;). Thiel invited him to move to San Francisco, where Vance took up a job at Mithril Capital, one of Thiel&#8217;s companies. When Vance later moved back to Ohio and started his own fund, Narya Capital, Thiel was one of the original investors providing funds. It&#8217;s worth noting a subtle nod of the head to Thiel here that may demonstrate the depth of Vance&#8217;s fealty to Thiel &#8211; Vance&#8217;s fund &#8216;Narya&#8217; is a name taken from Tolkien&#8217;s Lord of the Rings fantasy saga. Thiel is a super-fan of Tolkien &#8211; once bragging that he&#8217;d memorized the entirety of the book series &#8211; and as a consequence has used names from it for a number of his companies, such as Mithril Capital and Palantir. Vance seems to have &#8216;paid tribute&#8217; to his mentor by naming his company in the same way. The Dark Enlightenment Thiel and Vance both have another influence though: around 2007 a number of individuals gave birth to a far-right ideology that is referred to as the neoreactionary movement (abbreviated to NRx), sometimes also referred to as the &#8216; Dark Enlightenment &#8216;. While it has a broad number of views, one of those is that &#8211; quite simply &#8211; democracy is a failed system of government. As one of its founders, Curtis Yarvin (also known under the pen name &#8216;Mencius Moldbug&#8217;) has stated : “If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia.” Yarvin&#8217;s remedy for America is for a Caesar-like figure to take power, &#8220;retire all government employees&#8221; (a strategy he refers to by the acronym RAGE) and replace them with their own &#8216;yes men&#8217;, and for the system to be run like a corporate start-up, with an all-powerful CEO calling the shots. Furthermore : Yarvin seeks to reengineer governments by breaking them up into smaller entities called “patchworks,” which would be controlled by tech corporations. “The basic idea of Patchwork is that, as the crappy governments we inherited from history are smashed, they should be replaced by a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions,” he wrote in Patchwork: A Political System for the 21st Century. Yarvin states in Patchwork that the power of the &#8216;proprietor&#8217;/CEO of each realm would be absolute. Using a newly un democratized San Francisco as an example, he notes that they would &#8220;exercise undivided sovereignty over San Francisco. You have no constraint. Your residents are as ants in your kitchen… Since San Francisco is not an Islamic state, it does not ask its residents to agree that their hand will be cut off if they steal. But it could.&#8221; Furthermore, Yarvin says that each realm would have &#8220;Orwellian powers of observation and action&#8221;, in which all residents are &#8220;genotyped and iris-scanned. Public places and transportation systems track everyone. Security cameras are ubiquitous. Every car knows where it is and who is sitting in it, and tells the authorities both.&#8221; (Some of Yarvin&#8217;s other ideas include that humans have genetic differences that cause some groups to be &#8220;more suited to mastery&#8221;, while others &#8211; including Africans &#8211; were &#8220;more suited to slavery&#8221;. So…yeah.) Thiel and Vance are friends with, and heavily influenced by Yarvin , and have fully embraced the philosophies of the Dark Enlightenment (Thiel biographer Max Chafkin described Yarvin as the &#8220;house political philosopher&#8221; for the network of Thiel-connected VCs and tycoons often referred to as the &#8216;Thielverse&#8217;). This influence is evident when we hear that Thiel has stated that he no longer believes &#8220;that freedom and democracy are compatible&#8221; (because, &#8220;since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of &#8216;capitalist democracy&#8217; into an oxymoron&#8221;). Meanwhile, Vance has said that the advice he&#8217;d give to Trump upon being elected would be: “Fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.” “And when the courts stop you,” he went on, “stand before the country, and say&#8221; — he quoted Andrew Jackson, giving a challenge to the entire constitutional order — “the chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.” This is a description, essentially, of a coup. &#8220;We are in a late republican period,” Vance said later, evoking the common New Right view of America as Rome awaiting its Caesar. “If we’re going to push back against it, we’re going to have to get pretty wild, and pretty far out there, and go in directions that a lot of conservatives right now are uncomfortable with.&#8221; Vance&#8217;s views are straight out of Yarvin&#8217;s playbook, from his suggestion of replacing government employees with his own &#8216;yes men&#8217; (Yarvin&#8217;s &#8216;RAGE&#8217; ), to the need for a new Caesar/dictator to take control. Furthermore, Yarvin&#8217;s patchworks fit right in with a long-held desire of Thiel&#8217;s &#8211; and a lot of other libertarians of his ilk &#8211; to live by their own rules (that is, without government regulation and taxes), in autonomous zones of some sort. In 2009, Thiel put forward what he saw as the possibilities for locations that would offer a new life of freedom, from cyberspace to actual space: Cyberspace &#8230;In the 2000s, companies like Facebook create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states. By starting a new Internet business, an entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. The limitation of the Internet is that these new worlds are virtual and that any escape may be more imaginary than real. Outer space &#8230;Because the vast reaches of outer space represent a limitless frontier, they also represent a limitless possibility for escape from world politics. But the final frontier still has a barrier to entry: Rocket technologies have seen only modest advances since the 1960s, so that outer space still remains almost impossibly far away. We must redouble the efforts to commercialize space. Seasteading &#8230;Between cyberspace and outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans. To my mind, the questions about whether people will live there (answer: enough will) are secondary to the questions about whether seasteading technology is imminent. From my vantage point, the technology involved is more tentative than the Internet, but much more realistic than space travel. Thiel has invested in all three of these &#8216;freedom locations&#8217; (via, for example, Facebook, SpaceX, and The Seasteading Institute respectively). But Yarvin&#8217;s model offered something new to Thiel &#8211; the literal breakdown of existing , modern democracies into corporate-controlled autonomous zones. Thiel later provided seed capital to the tune of $1.1 million for a company Curtis Yarvin founded in 2013, Tlön Corp. Rather than taking the name for his company from Tolkien, however, Yarvin borrowed from Jorge Luis Borges. As Corey Pein notes in his book Live Work Work Work Die : The name Tlön referenced a short story by Jorge Luis Borges in which “a secret society of astronomers, biologists, engineers, metaphysicians, poets, chemists, algebraists, moralists, painters, geometers&#8230; directed by an obscure man of genius” built a “brave new world” that forced old cultures and countries into extinction.” The crossovers with the previous century&#8217;s technocratic movement are obvious. As is a petition created in 2014 at the White House website by Google engineer, Curtis Yarvin-fan (and Occupy Wall Street co-founder) Justine Tunney, which proposed three points for a national referendum: Retire all government employees with full pensions. Transfer administrative authority to the tech industry. Appoint [Google executive chairman] Eric Schmidt as CEO of America. As a prescient 2013 TechCrunch article on the neoreactionary movement noted: You can see that a certain set of ideas are spreading through out the startup scene&#8230; It’s not hard to see why this ideology would catch-on with white male geeks. It tells them that they are the natural rulers of the world. Another prescient article at The Baffler (from 2014) hit the nail on the head: Neoreactionaries are explicitly courting wealthy elites in the tech sector as the most receptive and influential audience. Why bother with mass appeal, when you’re rebuilding the ancien régime ? The New Technocrats A decade on from the TechCrunch and Baffler articles, and it now feels like there are neoreactionaries everywhere in the tech industry. However, perhaps the most prominent, and influential, is Balaji Srinivasan. Srinivasan has been CTO of Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and a general partner at the leading venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He is also another member of the Thielverse: when Donald Trump won the Presidency in 2016, Thiel (who was in favour with Trump as one of his few financial backers leading into the election) put forward Srinivasan&#8217;s name as a candidate to lead the FDA in the new administration. Both Thiel and Srinivasan disapproved of the FDA&#8217;s regulations and trials for new drugs: &#8220;For every thalidomide, many dead from slowed approvals,&#8221; Srinivasan once tweeted (and deleted while under consideration for the gig). Thankfully, Trump rejected Thiel&#8217;s suggestion. As far back as 2013, Srinivasan was promoting &#8220;a society run by Silicon Valley&#8221;, and citing tech VCs&#8217; and CEOs&#8217; interest in &#8216;exiting&#8217; from US democracy and forming their own fiefdoms. Larry Page for example wants to set aside a part of the world for unregulated experimentation&#8230; Marc Andreessen: &#8220;the world is going to see an explosion of countries in the years ahead.&#8221; Two of the founders of PayPal &#8211; Peter Thiel is into seasteading, and Elon Musk wants to build a Mars colony. Srinivasan also invested in a certain company along with Peter Thiel &#8211; Curtis Yarvin&#8217;s Tlön. This connection was not coincidental &#8211; perhaps more than anyone else, Srinivasan has taken Yarvin&#8217;s ideas of &#8216;patchworks&#8217; and run with them, actively promoting for many years now the creation of what he has called &#8216; Network States &#8216;: communities that are at first digital, being formed online, which then eventually crowd-fund resources to, as a group, buy into or build autonomous cities and states. Srinivasan identifies the pioneers who would begin creating these new Network State societies as the &#8216;Gray Tribe&#8217;: intelligent people, mostly in tech, who have moved beyond America&#8217;s traditional Red and Blue political tribes and want to create a new political system…but nevertheless remain in alignment with the Reds, while being openly hostile toward Blues. He explained all of this in a rambling 4 hour podcast interview, in which he raised some truly fascist-style methods in literally taking control of San Francisco: You have a foothold of private property and you have a group membership of Gray tribe&#8230;you also issue t-shirts [that are] gray color&#8230;you fence off a street and make clear that it&#8217;s under Gray control. &#8230;Every week or every month you have a policeman&#8217;s banquet. All Gray-sympathetic policemen are allowed to come to this banquet. Every policeman&#8217;s son, daughter, wife, cousin, sibling, whatever should get a job at a tech company in security, and again you tap the Gray root network. You also do things like you donate to the policeman&#8217;s benevolent Union or what have you, right, and Grays publicly donate &#8211; they don&#8217;t just donate, they tweet out that they donate, okay? You start to actually merge the Gray and police social networks. What you also do is all of the kind of military stuff that tech is funding &#8211; so Palantir, Anduril [ a military tech company set up by another Peter Thiel protege, Palmer Luckey&#8230;and yes, that is another Lord of the Rings reference ]. You bring those folks in as speakers and the policemen can look at this stuff and they love that, right? A huge win would be a great &#8216;Gray pride&#8217; parade with 50,000 Grays, that would be massive, that would start to say &#8220;WHOSE STREETS, OUR STREETS&#8221;&#8230;.you have the Bitcoin parade, you have the drones flying overhead in formation&#8230;you have the police at the Gray Pride Parade, they&#8217;re flying the Anduril drones&#8230;ideally you even design the police uniforms. (It&#8217;s interesting to note that the gray shirt proposed by Srinivasan echoes the gray-shirted uniform of the Technocracy movement from almost a century previous.) &#8220;Reds should be welcome&#8221; in this new Gray-ruled San Francisco, Srinivasan says, but &#8220;no Blue should be welcome there.&#8221; Furthermore, he says, movies of &#8220;Blue abuses&#8221; should be shown to residents. He compares these moves to the deNazification of Germany after the Second World War. Despite how batshit insane and fascist in tone it all may sound, Srinivasan&#8217;s Network State following has grown in recent years &#8211; so much so that a yearly conference is now held to discuss the idea, featuring some of the biggest names in various tech industry areas such as crypto and venture capitalism. At the conference, Srinivasan has explicitly laid out the plan for achieving &#8220;that seemingly impossible thing of building a new country&#8221;. Network Staters must first create, he said, a &#8220;parallel establishment&#8221;. By this he means two things &#8211; (1) creating &#8216;parallel societies&#8217; (both online, and in the real world e.g. from tech &#8216;communes&#8217; to &#8216;charter cities&#8217;), and (2) creating &#8216;parallel institutions&#8217; in media, education, law, finance and science (to take over from the &#8216;legacy&#8217; institutions of the NYT, Harvard University, the US dollar etc &#8211; those familiar with neoreactionary views will likely recognize Srinivasan&#8217;s &#8220;legacy institutions&#8221; as a parallel of &#8216;The Cathedral&#8217;). The new Network State institutions &#8220;exist alongside the legacy in parallel; they&#8217;re gaining strength, they&#8217;re pulling away users, until they become the new thing.&#8221; The Network Staters even explicitly note that Elon Musk&#8217;s purchase of Twitter (now &#8216;X&#8217;) was an example of the creation of a parallel institution by the technocrats to challenge legacy media (which makes sense of all of Musk&#8217;s tweets deriding the NYT and others in the past couple of years). Talking to Srinivasan , Garry Tan &#8211; CEO of tech venture capital behemoth Y Combinator (and surprise, surprise, formerly of Peter Thiel&#8217;s Palantir) &#8211; discussed how the political landscape of San Francisco was already being transformed as per the Network State vision. Not only has Tan spearheaded a takeover of San Francisco&#8217;s local government by big tech through financial means, but he also noted Musk&#8217;s contribution to taking power through non-democratic means: What&#8217;s next for San Francisco? We&#8217;ve stated the problem, we&#8217;ve outlined the political machine, and we&#8217;ve talked about how we&#8217;ve replaced some pieces of that political machine. Specifically, we have a parallel media now, with Elon&#8217;s Twitter, or X. Getting a parallel media was a key piece, and it wasn&#8217;t done through voting. &#8230;that&#8217;s a possible recipe for reforming San Francisco, and building the alternative tech political machine. And if it works in SF, it will work everywhere&#8230;this is just getting started.&#8221; (It is perhaps worth remembering that Yarvin&#8217;s original example for his &#8216;patchworks&#8217; was a takeover of San Francisco.) Similarly, Peter Thiel has acknowledged that the creation of PayPal a quarter of a century ago was intended to give birth to a parallel institution for finance. [T]he great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms&#8230;I suspect that the mode for escape must involve some sort of new and hitherto untried process that leads us to some undiscovered country. &#8230;The founding vision of PayPal centered on the creation of a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution — the end of monetary sovereignty, as it were. While PayPal has now itself largely become a part of the legacy financial system, it&#8217;s not difficult to see how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken its place as the &#8216;parallel institution&#8217; for finance &#8211; so it is no surprise to learn that crypto-tycoons are all in on the Network State idea: Ethereum&#8217;s creator Vitalik Buterin was one of the speakers at Srinivasan&#8217;s Network State conference, and the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, has also embraced the idea . It is therefore worth noting that the Trump campaign has in recent months pivoted hard to cryptocurrency. Despite previously being against it, labeling it as &#8220;a scam against the dollar&#8221;, in July Trump was suddenly the marquee speaker at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, at which he promised to make the United States the “crypto capital” of the world . And cryptocurrency is not the only &#8216;parallel institution&#8217; that the Trump campaign is backing &#8211; they have also proposed up to 10 &#8216;freedom cities&#8217; on federally owned land. As already discussed, this meshes closely with the neoreactionary and Network State ideologies , and their related projects currently in development: Balaji’s concept of the Network State builds on the idea of “charter cities”, urban areas that constitute a special economic zone, similar to free ports. There are several such projects under construction around the world, including in Nigeria and Zambia. At a recent rally in Las Vegas, Donald Trump promised that, if elected in November, he would free up federal land in Nevada to “create special new zones with ultra-low taxes and ultra-low regulation”, to attract new industries, build affordable housing and create jobs. The plan would, he said, revive “the frontier spirit and the American dream”. Other similar projects are already underway beyond the United States. There is Zuzalu, a &#8216;pop-up city&#8217; on the Mediterranean created by Vitalik Buterin (designer of the cryptocurrency Ethereum) that directly cites Balaji Srinivasan&#8217;s Network State as inspiration (Buterin also spoke at the recent Network State conference). Meanwhile, Próspera is a private tech city in Honduras that &#8220; markets itself as a libertarian paradise with low taxes and pro-bitcoin policies,&#8221; as well as little regulation around biomedical technologies. One of Próspera&#8217;s funders is Pronomos Capital , which is backed by (surprise!) Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, advised by Balaji Srinivasan, and founded by Patri Friedman &#8211; who originally founded The Seasteading Institute, which Thiel also previously supported in his quest for a new residence free of government interference. (The most recently elected Honduran government is however fighting to overturn the creation of the special zones by the previous government &#8211; but Próspera has now filed a $10.7 billion lawsuit against them in response.) Próspera is just one of a number of &#8216;charter cities&#8217; that is being funded by Pronomos Capital though. Other locations include Africa , South Asia and Palau. One in particular, however, seems to have star status. Praxis &#8211; which is funded by Thiel, Srinivasan, Andreessen, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the Winklevoss twins, and Palantir’s Joe Lonsdale (another of the &#8216;PayPal mafia&#8217;) &#8211; aims to be, as per Balaji Srinivasan&#8217;s playbook, &#8220;built on the Internet&#8221; first, and then manifested in the physical world through funding &#8211; the &#8220;first Network State&#8221;. The website for Praxis doesn&#8217;t mince words, calling itself &#8220;The Next America&#8221; and promising the dream of &#8220;permissive regulation&#8221; to all its tech-bro funders. It has an application for citizenship, its very own weird cult-like promotional video , and has just claimed to have raised $525 million in financing to build the physical city. As pointed out by journalist Gil Duran , last month it published a manifesto titled &#8220; The Network State: Crypto’s End Game &#8220;, which explicitly heralded the rise of Network States as modern democracies crumble: “As local communities dissolve and Nation States stumble, Network States will ascend. The next global superpower will be a Network State.” It is little surprise then to see the influence that sits behind it all: a recent BBC investigation noted that Praxis had &#8220;a reputation for edginess&#8221;, due to its roots in the neoreactionary movement: &#8220;[Praxis] hosted legendary parties: people spoke of candle-lit soirees in giant Manhattan loft spaces, where awkward computer coders mixed with hipster models and figures from the “Dark Enlightenment” – people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, who advocates a totalitarian future in which the world is ruled by corporate “monarchs”.&#8221; Furthermore, an internal company branding guide reviewed by the New York Times revealed some concerning philosophies that seem to resonate with some of the racist/eugenic overtones of certain neoreactionary identities: The guide denounces “enemies of vitality,” who “reject what they consider the optional ‘European beauty standards.” It goes on to extol “traditional, European/Western beauty standards on which the civilized world, at its best points, has always found success.” Beauty, here, connotes proper breeding: “In humans, beauty implies a number of things — namely that two people, themselves of beauty, formed a union to create more beautiful life,” it reads. “It’s basically a colonial endeavor that they’re involved in,” Sarah Moser, a geography professor at McGill University who specializes in new cities, told The Daily Beast . “They want to have a boys-only treehouse where they can go and do their bad-boy stuff and then come back to civilization,” she added. “They’re little boys who don’t want anyone to be the boss of them.” As Gil Duran noted in his article for The New Republic , the basic strategy of the billionaire/neoreactionary funders backing these charter city ideas is: Work with governments to create regulation-free, privately owned territories that, over time, will negotiate for full sovereignty (or file massive lawsuits against their host governments, if the experience of Honduras is any indication). But now, with Trump beholden to them for funding his campaign, and their own man J.D. Vance just a heartbeat away from taking over the presidency himself if Trump wins the election, perhaps these neoreactionary tech billionaires will have no constraints, no-one to answer to, or any need to work within the system or otherwise exit it &#8211; and they will be free to enact their anti-democratic vision upon the United States itself. Disrupting Democracy Less than a century on from the technocratic takeover envisioned by Elon Musk&#8217;s grandfather, today&#8217;s technology billionaires stand on the cusp of making it a reality. Though, it should be pointed out, to some degree it won&#8217;t precisely be &#8216;rule by scientists and engineers&#8217;, as more than a few of those tech billionaires are drop-outs or business/law degree graduates. As much as they might see themselves as tech visionaries, a lot of them are simply just ruthless businessmen who have stood on the back of brilliant scientists and engineers to achieve their success. &#8216;Smart people&#8217; are often the dumbest people you&#8217;ll ever meet, and in researching this article &#8211; watching numerous podcast and video interviews in which these &#8216;tech visionaries&#8217; featured, or reading their writings &#8211; I discovered that many of these supposedly incredibly smart people are the dumbest motherfuckers you&#8217;d ever meet, with zero ability for introspection or emotional intelligence. And while most of them would probably describe their political philosophy as &#8216;libertarian&#8217;, a little digging usually found that the personal freedom they supposedly support is typically reserved for themselves and their business strategies alone &#8211; not everyone else. As Robert Anton Wilson was said to have once clarified when asked about his own libertarian philosophy: &#8220;I am not that kind of libertarian, really; I don&#8217;t hate poor people&#8221;. So Peter Thiel can say he&#8217;s a libertarian, while being the co-founder of Palantir, one of the modern world&#8217;s most powerful companies in the area of personal surveillance and monitoring , as well as funding the financial destruction of media outlet Gawker because they posted stories about him that he didn&#8217;t like. Or Elon Musk can say he is a &#8220;free speech absolutist&#8221;, but suspend journalists from Twitter/X when the subject of that free speech is him. These tech bros live under the delusion that they are brilliant, rather than just fortunate, and should thus rule over the rest of us less-intelligent people. And as Anil Dash has remarked , &#8220;it&#8217;s important to remember, nobody becomes a billionaire by accident . You have to have wanted that level of power, control and wealth more than you wanted anything else in your life.&#8221; These are not, therefore, people that you want with power and control over the rest of us. There&#8217;s a certain amount of sociopathy (possibly ranging to psychopathy) involved with a lot of these individuals &#8211; they are not in any way going to be benevolent, empathetic overlords. Furthermore, as Dash notes: If you have access to a billionaire (and billionaires all have access to each other, because it suits their ego to think of each other as peers), most are very easy to program by simply playing to their insecurity and desire for acknowledgement of exceptionalism, and so they push each other further and further into extreme ideas because their entire careers have been predicated on the idea that they&#8217;re genius outliers who can see things others can&#8217;t, and that their wealth is a reward for that imagined merit. &#8220;I must be smart, look how rich I am.&#8221; Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has a similar view of of the growing extremism of tech billionaires , warning that &#8220;it&#8217;s impossible to overstate the degree to which many big tech CEOs and venture capitalists are being radicalized by living within their own cultural and social bubble.&#8221; They also, it should be noted, have a really low opinion of people who they see as lacking in intellect. Which makes their getting in bed with Donald Trump fascinating, as you can only imagine the contempt with which they would speak about him behind closed doors (even Vance himself has previously gone on record multiple times as a &#8216;never-Trumper&#8217;). The relationship is one of pure convenience for them, as he is the candidate they see as being most malleable to their cause. As Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie has stated , &#8220;They see Trump as a useful idiot… He’s somebody who’ll do what they want.&#8221; Peter Thiel with Donald Trump Chillingly, one of the few points of agreements between Trump and the tech billionaires might be on the topic of &#8216;race science&#8217;. While Trump rants about &#8220; a lot of bad genes in our country right now &#8220;, neoreactionaries have for years complained about the &#8216;woke&#8217; mainstream media not allowing them to speak their mind on the same topic. As the prescient 2013 Techcrunch article about the rise of neoreactionary views in the tech world noted: They want to be able to say stuff like “Asians, Jews and whites are smarter than blacks and Hispanics because genetics” without being called racist. Or at least be able to express such views without the negative consequences of being labeled racist. Speaking of which, neoreactionaries are obsessed with a concept called “human biodiversity” (HBD) — what used to be called “scientific racism.” Specifically, they believe that IQ is one of — if not the — most important personal traits, and that it’s predominately genetic. Neoreactionaries would replace, or supplement, the “divine right” of kings and the aristocracy with the “genetic right” of elites. Or as Gil Duran, who has long been warning of the danger posed by this neoreactionary tech elite, summarized it : &#8220;I&#8217;ve been describing this as an ideology of supremacy: tech supremacy, wealth supremacy, male supremacy, white supremacy, Western culture supremacy…they believe that they are the most important people on the planet; they believe they are the most important people in history; being wealthy they&#8217;re surrounded by people who don&#8217;t tell them otherwise; and they have enough money to make a lot of trouble for a long time.&#8221; &#8220;Enough money&#8221; is an understatement. Pro-cryptocurrency donors were responsible for almost half of all corporate donations to PACs in the 2024 election cycle. In the lead-up to the election, Elon Musk is the world&#8217;s richest person, and has been the leading backer of Trump and Vance&#8217;s ticket via America PAC &#8211; not to mention his control of one of the leading social media sites (a &#8216;parallel media outlet&#8217;). While you can&#8217;t give water to a voter standing in line in Georgia, Musk is free to award a $1 million prize each day to mobilize voters in swing states. And while there&#8217;s a pure power simply in their wealth, it should also be noted that there has been a growing martial drift to the tech these tycoons are interested in. Post-PayPal, Peter Thiel created his spy company Palantir. Young entrepreneurs are seeing a lucrative future in creating technology for the military , perhaps best exemplified by Oculus Rift creator Palmer Luckey, who went from a kid who designed a virtual reality headset to founding the military tech start-up Anduril, and recently stated that &#8220;every country needs a ‘warrior class’ excited to enact ‘violence on others in pursuit of good aims’ . Which of course, depends on how you interpret aims as being &#8216;good&#8217;… An article in The Atlantic from early 2024 warned of the growing danger of this tech elite, under the headline &#8220; The Rise of Techno-Authoritarianism &#8220;: The new technocrats are ostentatious in their use of language that appeals to Enlightenment values — reason, progress, freedom — but in fact they are leading an antidemocratic, illiberal movement. Many of them profess unconditional support for free speech, but are vindictive toward those who say things that do not flatter them. They tend to hold eccentric beliefs: that technological progress of any kind is unreservedly and inherently good; that you should always build it, simply because you can; that frictionless information flow is the highest value regardless of the information’s quality; that privacy is an archaic concept; that we should welcome the day when machine intelligence surpasses our own. And above all, that their power should be unconstrained. The systems they’ve built or are building — to rewire communications, remake human social networks, insinuate artificial intelligence into daily life, and more — impose these beliefs on the population, which is neither consulted nor, usually, meaningfully informed. &#8230;Silicon Valley’s influence easily exceeds that of Wall Street and Washington. It is reengineering society more profoundly than any other power center in any other era since perhaps the days of the New Deal. Many Americans fret — rightfully — about the rising authoritarianism among MAGA Republicans, but they risk ignoring another ascendant force for illiberalism: the tantrum-prone and immensely powerful kings of tech. So what happens when these radicalized, ultra-wealthy neoreactionary Silicon Valley billionaires &#8220; explicitly believe that democracy is not the preferable operating system of government or society &#8220;? After 10 to 15 years of talking about it, they now appear to be putting their plans into action in the real world : You see, while the Network State cult mostly focuses on creating new sovereign territories, it also recommends an alternative: Taking over existing governments and institutions to bring them under tech billionaire control&#8230; They take this very seriously. They’re working to disrupt the very idea of nationhood and citizenship by creating a network of sovereign global territories protected by military grade security. They plan to use their massive wealth to reshape the balance of power in their favor – permanently&#8230; The Network State is no longer a fever dream in a tech nerd podcast. The NS cult is making big moves. It&#8217;s a global campaign, backed by billionaires, to execute colonialist power grabs all around the world. As Network State believer and CEO of Y-Combinator Garry Tan &#8211; who has been working on the tech-funded takeover of San Francisco&#8217;s local government &#8211; proclaimed : &#8220;If we can build here, we can take over the whole country – we&#8217;re going to take over every nation in the world.&#8221; President Dwight Eisenhower&#8217;s famous farewell address in 1961 has often been quoted for its warning about the grave implications of the establishment of a &#8220;military-industrial complex&#8221;. Few people who have cited it however have noted that Eisenhower&#8217;s warning was not just about the military-industrial complex, but also the possible future dangers of a technocracy: &#8220;Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture,&#8221; Eisenhower stated, &#8220;has been the technological revolution during recent decades… In holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.&#8221; 63 years on from Eisenhower&#8217;s warning, that danger has become manifest. This article came together after seeing the same threads of information constantly present themselves in various news stories and sources. These are linked throughout the article in the relevant places. However, two primary inspirations that must be acknowledged are Max Chafkin&#8217;s biography of Peter Thiel, &#8216; The Contrarian &#8216;, and a number of articles by journalist Gil Duran. While the latter are linked within the article, I also recommend visiting his website The Nerd Reich for a one-stop place to explore these articles with additional commentary and context.

The Trial Balance is CFO’s weekly preview of stories, stats and events to help you prepare. Part 1 — Marc Andreessen says LLM development may not end well for stakeholders Earlier this month at the technology conference Ray Summit, Marc Andreessen, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, provided an interesting take recently published in its entirety on large language models (LLMs) and their profitability trajectory, specifically within product development. As Hewlett Packard Enterprise CFO Marie Myers mentioned during her keynote at a conference earlier this month, her company is one of many currently in the process of developing products that are essentially custom LLMs for businesses. While Andreessen doesn’t dismiss the possibility of enormous profits for the few competitors who may emerge at the top of the LLM product race, he candidly identifies the reality that these companies may be competing in a “race to the bottom” due to the open availability of free LLMs, the inability to compete with open-source datasets and the large drop in price per token — a fundamental input and output metric that quantifies the processing power LLMs require. When discussing the future of LLM development , Andreessen said, “Maybe all of these companies are in a race to the bottom. It [may] actually turn out, selling intelligence is like selling rice or something, where it turns out anybody can make an LLM, there’s open-source LLMs [and] there’s new LLM startups every day.” He also referenced the data dilemma faced by these companies, which was self-identified via a leaked internal memo from Google last year, dubbed “ We Have No Moat, and Neither Does OpenAI .” He noted the drop in token cost is rapidly outpacing the precedent set by Moore’s Law , an empirical phenomenon heavily relied upon by semiconductor developers that quantifies the trend of transistors on a microchip doubling approximately every two years while the cost of computing power is halved. “[That’s] the exact opposite of what you’d expect if somebody was going to get a lot of profit out of that business,” Andreessen said.

Speaking from a new aluminium can factory in South Auckland , Luxon addressed concerns about Trump’s suggestion on the campaign trail that he would put a 20% tariff on imports from foreign countries, New Zealand included. Luxon appeared unsure whether the United States President-elect really would introduce a 20% tariff on New Zealand exports to the US after his inauguration next year. “It’s a new administration. They’re just getting over their win. They’ll take time to settle into what they want to do,” he said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “What I’m confident about is that we’ll find a way to work incredibly well with the US.” Luxon refused to tell the Herald his personal opinions about the election. When it was pointed out to Luxon that he once had election hoardings for the Democrats on his lawn when he lived in Chicago, and has spoken of his admiration for former President Barack Obama in the past, he still declined to say whether yesterday’s result left him disappointed. The responsibility to forge a relationship with Trump and his administration will fall on Luxon. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. His Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters told media as he walked into Parliament that Luxon would head to the US before him. Peters said the Government would be “hitting the ground running” and a lot of preparation had already happened in anticipation of a possible change in US administration. He wouldn’t commit to securing a trade deal over the next four years nor say what the Government would do differently this time: “You’ll have to find out after I have spoken to them”. Peters was asked the first question during Question Time on Thursday, about how the results of the US election may affect New Zealand. He said any result would have a “significant impact” on New Zealand, the Indo-Pacific, and the world, and the Republican’s election “would be no exception”. “We congratulate President Trump and [Vice-President-elect] JD Vance on the election victory and we look forward to working with them and their incoming administration,” Peters said. “But also we acknowledge the contribution of outgoing President Joe Biden and his Administration.” He said the US was one of New Zealand’s “closest and most important partners” and the Government planned to “further enhance our relationship”. Peters reiterated previous comments about being prepared to engage with the new Trump administration, including having the “right people” in Washington. Harris concedes to Trump Democratic candidate Vice-President Kamala Harris conceded the election to Trump over the phone after he secured his political comeback four years after leaving the White House. “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” Trump said on Wednesday night NZT, speaking to a rowdy crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Centre in Florida.

Trump then praised Elon Musk , the richest man in the world, who gave US$120 million ($201m) to his campaign.

Facebook X Email Save Story Pastor David McClellan serving a hot dog at a table for Republicans United outside a polling station at the Mesa Convention Center in Mesa, AZ. Photograph: Jamie Lee Taete Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story Mesa, AZ — A group of America First groypers, college Republicans, and a Christian nationalist pastor were handing out burgers and hot dogs to voters in Phoenix on Tuesday—but only if they voted for former president Donald Trump. The cookout took place about 100 yards from a polling station—and it was likely illegal. The effort was organized by the far-right College Republicans United group, in association with the Patriot Party of Arizona. It began just after polls opened at the Mesa Convention Center. Groypers, the name that followers of white nationalist Nick Fuentes give themselves, were helping hand out hot dogs, burgers, and cold drinks. Manning the grill was Pastor David MacLellan, a Christian nationalist who is the chaplain for the Patriot Party of Arizona and subscribes to the extremist ideology of the Black Robe Regiment . “We’re giving away hot dogs and hamburgers to folks who are doing the right thing, voting for Trump,” MacLellan tells WIRED. Isaiah, a self-identified groyper who would not provide his last name, confirmed that the group was giving food only to Trump voters, but added that the food is “specifically for Trump voters, but we do welcome others if they do want to come over and change their mind.” Providing food for a specific group of people at a polling location is in breach of federal law. “Not only is it illegal to give just to voters for one candidate, one cannot limit it only to voters. It must be made available to all people in the area, including children and others ineligible to vote, to avoid running afoul of federal law against vote buying,” Rick Hasen, a law professor at UCLA, tells WIRED, citing the same rules that Elon Musk was accused of breaching with his $1 million ballot. The Arizona Secretary of State’s office, which sets the rules for behavior at polling locations, did not respond to a request for comment. Arrow Arrow The College Republican United group was set up in 2018 by Rick Thomas, who is also a member of the Patriot Party of Arizona. Thomas told WIRED he founded the group out of frustration at the Republican student group that was in place at Arizona State University. “We eventually broke off and formed our own organization that was very pro-Trump,” Thomas said. “We are American first; we are MAGA.” While not all members of College Republican United are members of Fuentes’ group, there is a significant overlap, Isaiah told WIRED. 2024 US Election After months of campaigning, scandal, propaganda, and downright weirdness, it all comes down to this . Thomas portrayed the group as a relatively mainstream student group, but evidence online indicates otherwise: The College Republican United’s website’s book recommendations page features two deeply antisemitic works: the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Henry Ford’s The International Jew : The World’s Foremost Problem. Another member of the CRU, Kevin Decuyper, was recently hired as an aide to former far-right sheriff Joe Arpaio, &quot;There are reasons why College Republicans United have been denounced by so many GOP organizations,” says Nick Martin, an investigative journalist who closely tracks extremist groups in Arizona and who runs the online publication The Informant . “The organization recommends its members read discredited and debunked books filled with racist pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. Their guest speakers have included white nationalists, neo-Nazis, Pizzagate peddlers, fringe political candidates and, rarely, some actual Republicans.” You can follow all of WIRED&#x27;s 2024 presidential election coverage here .

Photo: Supplied / PM's office via X Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says he had ""a good connection"" with US president-elect Donald Trump during a ""very positive, very warm"" conversation this morning. Luxon spoke to Trump on Tuesday for the first time since the US election in a phone call which Luxon said lasted 10-to-15 minutes and canvassed a range of topics. ""We talked a little bit about some of the challenges in our respective economies, and also about some of the global conflicts, particularly Ukraine and Middle East. ""It was really just a relational chance to say hello, and we committed that we would catch up in person at some future forum."" The discussion did not delve into deep detail, Luxon said. ""It was very positive, very warm, you know, a good connection,"" he said. ""He's got a lot of attachment to New Zealand. It's a place that he speaks very highly of."" Luxon said he also shared his experience living and working in the US: ""I come from a business background into politics as well."" He did not raise Trump's proposal to implement tariffs on imports into the US but said the president-elect was aware of New Zealand's commitment to free trade. ""[Trump] knows New Zealand well, and ... the fact that we are a small nation that is very determined to continue to trade with anyone and everyone across the world."" Luxon said they talked about the two countries' ""long and important relationship"" and continuing their partnership throughout the Indo-Pacific region. The call took place roughly five days after Trump's commanding victory. Luxon said it was a ""good sign"" that Trump made time for such a small nation given his busy schedule. Since Trump's landslide victory last week he has spoken with several world leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and China's Xi Jin Ping. Luxon's usual interview slot with Morning Report was moved to allow for the call from the United States. Posting on X, Luxon said New Zealand and the United States had a strong and enduring partnership. ""Good to speak with President-elect @realDonaldTrump this morning to congratulate him on his historic election victory. ""We agreed on the importance of deepening ties between our two nations and I look forward to doing just that."" The prime minister is heading to the APEC summit in Peru on Thursday where he will meet outgoing President Joe Biden. President-elect Trump campaigned on introducing tariffs of up to 20 percent on imported goods as part of his 'America First' economic policy. Luxon has previously warned against jumping to conclusions about Trump policies that might affect New Zealand and has congratulated the Republican on a ""comprehensive win"". ""I look forward to working with him and advancing the interests of our great countries,"" he said last week. ""I know both sides of the aisle in Washington... I've got no doubt we'll do everything we can to work constructively to move forward together."" Asked about Trump's campaigning on trade tariffs which could be bad for New Zealand, Luxon said we needed to wait and see what policies were actually introduced. Kiwi winemakers are anxiously waiting to see whether he follows through on the promise, with the US market accounting for some 40 percent of New Zealand's wine exports.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says Elon Musk should focus on outcomes and value for money as the Tesla founder takes charge of a US department focused on Government efficiency . US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Musk, the billionaire head of Tesla, SpaceX, X and other businesses, with entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy would lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle Government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies,” Trump said. Musk said it would “send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people”. The Trump statement said the department may be the “Manhattan Project” of “our time”. The Manhattan Project was the scientific research development project that led to the production of the first nuclear weapons. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Tesla and SpaceX chief executive has been named by US President-elect Donald Trump to lead a department charged with battling Government inefficiency. Photo / AP Luxon’s coalition Government has also wanted to cut down on regulation and find efficiencies across Government departments to cut down on spending . Asked by the Herald what tips he would send Musk, Luxon said: “I just say stay focused on outcomes, make sure you are getting good value for money and that every dollar is counting to improving the daily lives of your citizenry.” Musk has previously expressed interest in Luxon’s governance. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Last October, Musk congratulated him on National’s election victory. In September, Musk replied on X to a video Luxon shared of him in Malaysia. He said, “I like the new NZ PM”, who, he said, had “good energy and talks directly to the public”. Musk became a key supporter of Trump ahead of the former President’s re-election last week . He’s previously been vocal about the need to find Government effiencies and proposed giving the agency the Doge acronym, in what appears to be a reference to the Japanese Shiba Inu dog meme and Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Trump said the Doge would provide advice and guidance to his administration to drive large-scale structural reform and “create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before”. He said the department’s work will conclude by July 4, 2026 – the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Posting to X afterwards, Musk said Doge’s actions “will be posted online for maximum transparency”. “Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!” he wrote. “We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining.” Luxon had his first conversation with Trump on Tuesday , which the New Zealand Prime Minister called “very positive”. He said Trump had an “obvious” respect for New Zealand. Prime minister Christopher Luxon has had a phone call with Donald Trump this morning.

The conversation touched on the economic challenges in their respective countries and global conflicts, especially Ukraine and in the Middle East. “It was really just a relational chance to say hello.

Steve Jennings/Getty Images This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . Marc Andreessen argued against sharing too many personal details at work, urging professionalism. Some pandemic-era norms on remote work and DEI appear to be shifting. Experts suggest balancing authenticity with professionalism to maintain workplace harmony. Marc Andreessen doesn't need to know everything about you. In a post on X over the weekend, the famous venture capitalist dismissed the notion of ""bringing your whole self to work,"" arguing that certain things aren't appropriate to share in the office and beyond. ""Leave your full self at home where it belongs and act like a professional and a grownup at work and in public,"" Andreessen, a cofounder and general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, wrote. Andreessen isn't the first to reject the idea. But workplace norms about things like office attire, remote work , and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts appear to be drifting further from pandemic-era mores. Megan Reitz, a coauthor of the book ""Speak Out, Listen Up,"" previously told Business Insider that bringing your whole self to work might sound good — or at least make some workers feel like their bosses care about their people as, well, people&nbsp;— but often has limits. ""When managers and leaders say, 'Bring your whole self to work,' they're leaving out the terms and conditions,"" Reitz said. Those terms might involve sensitive topics like politics. In April, Google fired more than two dozen employees who staged sit-ins at the company's offices in California and New York. CEO Sundar Pichai said in a memo to employees at the time that some actions weren't appropriate for the office . ""This is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics,"" he wrote. Andreessen's comments follow a contentious US election . On an episode of their podcast, ""The Ben and Marc Show,"" Andreessen and his A16z cofounder, Ben Horowitz, celebrated Donald Trump's reelection . Andreessen described Trump's win as an antidote to the ""repression"" that he and other crypto-industry founders experienced under the Biden administration. An effort to encourage authenticity Ella Washington, a professor of practice at Georgetown University, previously told BI that the idea of showing up at work with all your flags flying became more popular in the 2010s. But she added that it has to be within reason and in accordance with what's acceptable at an organization. ""It is said in a way that is supposed to encourage authenticity, but the reality is in most workplaces you can't bring your whole self,"" Washington said. ""You can likely bring your whole professional self."" She said people in charge at work need to define what's acceptable, and then workers can determine whether the organization's values comport with their own. ""When it comes to business, it shouldn't be just based on our personal politics,"" she said. ""And I know that's difficult for people to say, because it's like, 'OK, wait. I can bring my whole self to work, but I can't talk about politics.'"" Jake Telkamp, an assistant professor in the Hull College of Business at Augusta University in Georgia, previously told BI that fraught discussions about politics at work tended to leave people feeling depleted and less inclined to help their coworkers. Besides, Telkamp said, a fight isn't likely to change someone's mind. He argued that leaders and workers should instead focus on making people feel valued regardless of their background. ""When there was a high level of that, it reduced that negative effect of having liberals and conservatives on a team together,"" Telkamp said.

Parmi tous ceux qui célèbrent la réélection de l’ancien président Donald Trump, peu ont autant de raisons de se réjouir qu’Elon Musk. Moins d’une semaine après le 5 novembre, sa fortune avait augmenté de 70 milliards de dollars (environ 66 milliards d’euros) soit un retour monstrueux sur un investissement dans la campagne du républicain qui semblait déjà démesuré : 120 millions de dollars, sur quelques mois. Car la conversion de l’homme le plus riche du monde en militant trumpiste est récente. En 2020, cet ancien démocrate, qui avait l’habitude de vanter les mérites de son entreprise, Tesla, en matière de droits LGBTQ+, et finançait les démocrates comme les républicains (mais s’abstenait pour les campagnes présidentielles), répondait à la journaliste du New York Times Kara Swisher qui l’interrogeait sur ses idées politiques : « Je suis socialement très libéral. Et sur le plan économique, je suis peut-être à droite du centre, ou au centre. Je ne sais pas. » Il appelait simplement de ses vœux une « personne normale de bon sens » , dont « les valeurs tapent pile au milieu du pays » . Ce Musk-là est devenu méconnaissable. Désormais, jour et nuit, il partage sur le réseau social X (anciennement Twitter, qu’il a racheté en 2022) ses sombres ruminations sur les migrants envahisseurs, les personnes transgenres et le « virus woke » qui menace la civilisation humaine. Avec le zèle d’un converti, il s’est employé à la réélection de Trump, mettant à son service son immense fortune, sa plateforme de communication globale, et son aura d’entrepreneur de génie. Le président élu ne s’y est pas trompé : « Une star est née : Elon ! , s’est-il enthousiasmé dans un long panégyrique le lendemain de sa réélection. C’est un super génie, il faut qu’on les protège, nous n’en avons pas tant que ça. » Il vous reste 92.56% de cet article à lire. La suite est réservée aux abonnés.

Of all the people celebrating the re-election of former president Donald Trump, few have as much to celebrate as Elon Musk. Less than a week after November 5, his fortune had risen by $70 billion (around €66 billion), a monstrous return on an investment in Trump's campaign that already seemed inordinate: $120 million over just a few months. The conversion of the richest man in the world into one of Trump's most fervent activists is a recent one. In 2020, the former Democrat, who used to extol the virtues of his company Tesla regarding its support of LGBTQ+ rights and financed candidates from both parties (though he abstained from presidential campaigns), was asked by the New York Times journalist Kara Swisher about his political views: ""I'm socially very liberal. And then economically right of center, maybe, or center. I don't know,"" he told her. He wished only for the president to be a ""normal person with common sense and whose values are smack in the middle of the country."" That Musk has become unrecognizable. Now, night and day, he shares his dark ruminations on X (formerly Twitter, which he bought in 2022) about invading migrants, transgender people and the ""woke virus"" threatening human civilization. With the zeal of a convert, he dedicated himself to Trump's re-election campaign, leveraging his immense fortune, global communications platform and reputation of entrepreneurial genius. The president-elect recognized this effort, praising him in lengthy panegyric the day after his re-election: ""A star is born: Elon! (...) He's a super genius. We have to protect our geniuses. We don't have that many of them."" Read more Subscribers only How Elon Musk uses X to support the far right and its financial interests You have 92.38% of this article left to read.

Vance to the Vice Presidency of the United States marks a significant, unsettling turn in American politics, reflecting the mainstreaming of neoreactionary (NRx) ideologies that seek to dismantle democratic structures in favor of hierarchical, authoritarian governance. Vance's connections with prominent NRx thinkers, particularly Curtis Yarvin, highlight this ideological shift toward rejecting democracy in favor of a society modelled after a corporate structure - a ‘GovCorp.’ Yarvin, a controversial figure with close ties to influential figures like Steve Bannon, Peter Thiel and Tucker Carlson , has emerged as a key intellectual force in this movement. His vision advocates a radical reimagining of governance, one where collective representation and civic responsibility are discarded in favor of centralized control and operational efficiency, at the expense of democratic participation and accountability.

According to Yarvin, these institutions work together to advance progressive ideologies while suppressing dissenting views. Yarvin's critique extends beyond accusations of institutional bias, positioning The Cathedral as a powerful ideological machine that maintains its influence by perpetuating a self-reinforcing ‘progressive orthodoxy.’ By framing democracy as an inherently coercive force that stifles intellectual and social freedom, Yarvin challenges the legitimacy of democratic institutions altogether. He posits that these institutions exist not to serve the public good, as they claim, but to indoctrinate and control, perpetuating what he views as a hypocritical adherence to principles of equality and representation that ultimately undermine genuine freedom. This view seeks to erode public trust in democratic structures, paving the way for a model of governance centered on authoritarian control, with loyalty, submission and efficiency prioritized over collective decision-making and accountability.

Photograph by Gage Skidmore ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/51876933345 ) NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA 2.0) The NRx alternative is to, first, ‘Retire All Government Employees’ (RAGE) in order to ‘reboot’ the economy (Musk’s new DOGE seems to be partially modelled on this), and, second, replace democratic institutions with a CEO (or even a Monarch). The resulting ‘GovCorp’ - a society run as a business - can then be regulated not via the ‘voice’ of its citizenry - there will be no democracy - but via their ability to ‘exit’ as consumers in a free market for governance. The corporate structures of GovCorps are to be embedded within Yarvin’s Patchwork model, which envisions the world divided into small, autonomous territories or ‘patches,’ each governed independently as a quasi-sovereign city-state. Under this system, each patch operates as a self-contained entity with its own policies, laws and societal norms. Governance within each patch is offered as a service, with citizens acting more as customers than as members of a community. Yarvin argues that this model creates a form of competition among patches, where territories vie to attract residents by providing desirable policies or services. Rather than engaging in the democratic process to influence governance, individuals express their preferences through a consumer-like choice: they can ‘exit’ a patch if they disagree with its policies and seek a more compatible governance model elsewhere. This transactional approach to governance reduces the citizen-government relationship to one of mere loyalty, devoid of democratic accountability. In Yarvin's view, democracy is supplanted by a form of corporate-style authoritarianism that diminishes the role of public participation. “ Peter Thiel’s backing of J.D. Vance signifies NRx ideology’s entry into mainstream politics, promoting a model where elite control and corporate efficiency undermine democratic norms. ” View fullsize Figure 3. Curtis Yarvin ( https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Curtis_Yarvin.jpg ) Creative Commons&nbsp;CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication J.D. Vance’s alignment with NRx ideology is also evident through his association with Peter Thiel, a billionaire who has become a prominent financier and proponent of anti-democratic governance models. Thiel’s investments reflect a dedication to creating alternatives to democratic systems, exemplified by his backing of projects like Curtis Yarvin’s Urbit software platform and the Seasteading Institute . These initiatives reflect libertarian and NRx ambitions to establish governance frameworks that function independently of state oversight. Thiel’s endorsement of The Sovereign Individual , a 1997 work by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg, further aligns him with NRx principles. In this book, Davidson and Rees-Mogg foresee a future where technology empowers wealthy individuals to ‘exit’ national governance and establish private sovereignties beyond collective governance structures. Thiel’s recent preface to a new edition of the book reinforces its influence among NRx advocates. View fullsize Figure 4. Seasteading. Credit Wendy Sitler-Roddier ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/9742300@N06/3213494031/ ) NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) In The Sovereign Individual , Davidson and Rees-Mogg argue that advancing technology and global economic integration will gradually make nation-states obsolete. These shifts, they propose, will allow the wealthy elite to separate from public governance and establish autonomous, self-ruled enclaves. This form of private governance sidesteps democratic accountability, redefining governance as a market-driven enterprise where allegiance, wealth, and control replace civic engagement and public accountability as the foundation of power. Thiel’s endorsement reflects a willingness to deprioritize democratic principles in favor of a system where governance is determined by market dynamics. In this model, the wealthy act as an ‘untethered elite,’ operating outside traditional government structures and with minimal obligations toward society. Thiel’s support for these ideas resonates with NRx philosophy, which advocates for a hierarchical, authoritarian structure where governance is a private matter, enabling elites to ‘exit’ mainstream society. Thiel’s support of the Seasteading Institute , led by Patri Friedman, exemplifies these NRx goals. Seasteading proposes creating autonomous, floating communities beyond the jurisdiction of any nation, representing Yarvin’s ‘exit’ philosophy in tangible form. In these enclaves, residents would be free to design societies according to their own rules, without national laws or democratic constraints, embodying a form of privatized governance accessible to those with the resources to participate. View fullsize Figure 5. Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson (Fair use) Patri Friedman, influenced by his libertarian father David Friedman and neoliberal grandfather Milton Friedman, merges business and ideology in his promotion of ‘dynamic geography’ - a system where governance is no longer tied to a fixed territory but instead exists within a flexible, competitive framework. The Seasteading Institute has been developing modular, permanent cities at sea, or ‘seasteads.’ These structures, described as ‘almost Lovecraftian’ and ‘prefigurative gov-corps,’ attempt to operate outside democratic jurisdictions. Seasteads exemplify the NRx vision of a decentralized ‘patchwork’ of independent, competing GovCorps), each functioning as a gated community, city-state or even an off-world colony. Figures like Elon Musk share a similar vision, imagining potential human colonies on Mars. In Friedman’s ‘dynamic geography,’ these sea-based ‘homesteads’ allow pioneers to experiment with new forms of governance. As outlined by Friedman and collaborator Joe Quirk : David Friedman described a machinery of freedom. Milton Friedman advocated the freedom to choose. Patri identified a machinery of freedom to choose … he proposed an idea that became contagious: imagine ten thousand homesteads on the sea – ‘seasteads’ – where ocean pioneers will be free to experiment with new societies. Aquatic citizens could live in modular pods that can detach at any time and sail to join another floating city, compelling ocean governments to compete for mobile citizens. A market of competing governments … would allow the best ideas for governance to emerge peacefully, unleashing unimaginable progress. … By such means, an economic and moral argument could become a technological experiment. (pp. 8-9) Urban sociologist Rowland Atkinson’s concept of ‘libertecture’ sheds light on the spatial dimensions of NRx and libertarian values. Libertecture encompasses urban developments like seasteads, gated communities, start-up cities and other forms of ‘freespace’, each structured to prioritise independence and autonomy for the privileged at the expense of democratic inclusivity. These spaces foster exclusivity, creating environments accessible only to those with wealth or connections, and undermine the democratic ideal of public, shared space. Atkinson’s analysis extends to other libertecture spaces, including digital ‘portal spaces,’ remote ‘pioneer exclaves,’ and even urban areas abandoned due to diverted investment. Each of these zones prioritizes wealth and autonomy over inclusivity and civic engagement, fostering social and economic divides that deepen inequality. By promoting environments that devalue collective responsibility, libertecture contributes to a fragmented urban landscape, where autonomy is privileged and social bonds weakened. Nick Land, an accelerationist ‘philosopher’ and influential figure in NRx circles, provides a more developed theoretical framework for these ideas, particularly through his concept of the ‘Dark Enlightenment. ’ Land argues that democracy, with its emphasis on equality and accountability, impedes technological and social progress, which he believes should be led by an elite few. For Land, democratic values like fairness and equality are outdated obstacles to innovation, and he advocates for a governance model where decision-making authority is concentrated among intellectual and technological elites. His views align closely with Yarvin’s, promoting a society governed by those deemed most capable, with little regard for public input or accountability. Land’s concept of ‘hyperstition’ - the idea that speculative ideas can shape reality simply by being propagated - plays a significant role in NRx ideology. Cyberpunk literature, particularly novels like Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash and William Gibson's Neuromancer , serves as a foundation for hyperstitional thinking in NRx circles. In Snow Crash , Stephenson introduces the concept of the ‘metaverse’ and envisions a world of quasi-sovereign city-states that closely resemble Yarvin's Patchwork model. Similarly, Neuromancer , which popularized the concept of ‘cyberspace,’ depicts a future where corporations control society, side-lining national governments and public interest. These novels, with their privatized, authoritarian structures, provide NRx advocates with a blueprint for reimagining governance as a privilege reserved for an elite. “ Hyperstition uses speculative visions to normalise authoritarianism, reshaping public perception to view elite-led governance as a desirable alternative to failing democracies. ” View fullsize Figure 6. Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg with a new preface by Peter Thiel (Fair use). NRx is all about dreaming of a certain kind. The process is central to the NRx hegemonic strategy. We might, for example, intuit that seasteads will not be established anytime soon . Their purpose is to reflect on the ostensible limits of freedom imposed by the state, so that others ‘will dream up and implement more practical alternatives’. For Land, time, like much else, is non-linear and thus relations between cause and effect are always complex. Futurity is in the here and now in the sense that it is not something that just unfolds; it is something we create. On occasion portended social imaginaries – designs, diagrams, fictions, maps, movies, plans, philosophies, prototypes, theories, dreams and more – become generative of the future; it is as if the tentacles of future entities reach back through time in order to bring into being the very elements necessary for their own materialization (ChatGPT comes to mind!). Projects – or prototypes - like The Sovereign Individual , seasteading, and Yarvin's Urbit are examples of hyperstition in action, blurring the boundary between fiction and reality . The Seasteading Institute’s autonomous floating communities mirror the cyberpunk vision of isolated, privatized enclaves beyond state jurisdiction, while Yarvin’s Patchwork model introduces competition between city-states similar to the fragmented societies in Snow Crash , where governance is a marketplace of services rather than a democratic engagement. By presenting these speculative ideas as practical alternatives, NRx advocates seek to reshape society, promoting elite control and undermining public accountability. Interest in creating independent states is growing, bolstered by political and institutional support . Organizations like the Cato Institute, Mises Institute, Foundation for Economic Education, and Mont Pelerin Society now back enclave libertarian ideas promoted by entities like the Start-up Cities Institute . The ‘red pill’ metaphor from The Matrix has also become a powerful symbol within NRx ideology, representing an ‘awakening’ to the supposed truth that democratic values are illusory, concealing an underlying superiority of authoritarian rule. For NRx proponents, the democratic emphasis on equality and accountability is not merely flawed but fundamentally deceptive, masking a natural hierarchy that authoritarian governance could better serve. The red pill is a gateway to NRx’s worldview, which trivializes democracy and elevates authoritarianism, replacing civic engagement with loyalty to an elite authority. This metaphor has helped NRx thinkers recruit followers by presenting an authoritarian worldview as a path to enlightenment. The rise of mainstream figures like Vance, who endorse or tacitly support NRx principles, poses serious threats to democratic society. As NRx ideas infiltrate mainstream politics, they introduce governance models that fundamentally oppose democracy. This influence risks transforming urban spaces from shared, public environments into libertecture-inspired zones designed to serve a privileged elite, leaving the majority to navigate a landscape stripped of public services and collective resources. In a world already grappling with critical issues like climate change, economic inequality and social fragmentation, NRx’s emphasis on loyalty-driven governance and individual autonomy represents a dangerous divergence from democratic values and civic responsibility. The increasing influence of figures like Vance, Yarvin, Thiel and Musk (who also claims to have been ‘red-pilled’) signals a shift in American politics that could weaken the foundations of democratic life, replacing them with a structure where wealth and power determine societal roles, undermining the collective principles that have traditionally supported democratic society.

The OpenAI CEO is promoting an upcoming $150 million second round of financing that values Rain AI &#8212; a fledgling manufacturer of high-performance semiconductors &#8212; at roughly $600 million, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. Altman was a major investor in Rain AI’s 2022 $25 million seed round , sources said. 4 Sam Altman is doing his best to create a viable Nvidia rival. AP The latest round is expected to begin next month, the source said. “He has introduced the company to all his investors for this series B round,” the source said of Altman.

REUTERS Altman is pushing Rain AI at a time his rival Elon Musk is speaking to Nvidia about investing in his xAI , The Post reported exclusively earlier this month. Nvidia has a staggering 85% market share in the artificial intelligence chip space and has become the most valuable company in the world with a $3.5 trillion market cap . It is expected to continue to sell its chips to Open AI even if it invests with Musk. Still, insiders speculated that Altman has grown concerned that Nvidia&#8217;s relationship with Musk is getting too cozy. Musk is expecting to soon spend billions to buy 100,000 Nvidia chips, CNBC reported . 4 Musk getting closer to Nvidia might be making Altman nervous. REUTERS “Rain AI is one of the legitimate players at the table when it comes to the future of AI and chips,” Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “There’s a lot of buzz around everything Rain AI is doing and it’s the early days of the AI revolution.,&#8221; Ives added. &#8220;There’s going to be many players, not just the ‘Godfather of AI’ Jensen Huang and Nvidia.” “When you have someone like Altman backing [them] that puts them right in the middle of Times Square with a spotlight on them,” he said. “Any company [Altman] backs is a huge vote of confidence and gives them a massive runway to where they can head.” Filed under artificial intelligence elon musk nvidia OpenAI sam altman 11/19/24 Read Next Subway rival Jersey Mike&#039;s Subs acquired by Blackstone in ...

JEFF MCINTOSH / THE CANADIAN PRESS / AP / SIPA La « droitosphère » américaine a fait son miel d’une vidéo captée en 2023. A l’occasion d’un point presse tourné dans un verger, on assiste au face-à-face déséquilibré entre le chef du Parti conservateur du Canada, Pierre Poilievre, droit dans ses bottes, et un journaliste qui l’accuse de s’inspirer de Donald Trump. « De quoi parlez-vous ? », le coupe Poilievre tout en continuant nonchalamment à croquer dans une pomme. Déstabilisé, son interlocuteur bafouille. Le député en profite pour resservir son leitmotiv : en revenir à une politique de « bon sens » qui fait défaut au gouvernement actuel. Sur X, Elon Musk a gratifié la séquence d’un émoji « feu ». La commentatrice pro-Trump américaine Megyn Kelly (ex de NBC et de Fox News) a applaudi sur le même réseau : « Pouvons-nous le faire venir dans notre pays ? » Adoubé, Pierre Poilievre était mis « sur la map » du monde conservateur, comme on dit au Québec. De Donald Trump, Pierre Poilievre, 45 ans, partage le goût de la formule choc que l’on retient à force d’être rabâchée. Dans sa bouche, l’inflation devient la « justinflation », pour viser nommément le premier ministre canadien, le libéral Justin Trudeau. Devant les caméras comme sur ses tee-shirts de campagne, il affiche son mantra « Axe the tax » (« couper dans les taxes »), bien décidé à passer à la moulinette la taxe carbone, l’impôt sur la pollution instauré par le gouvernement Trudeau.

NRx: el movimiento (subterráneo) que quiere cargarse la democracia,El País,24/11/2024,https://elpais.com/ideas/2024-11-24/nrx-el-movimiento-subterraneo-que-quiere-cargarse-la-democracia.html,"NRx: el movimiento (subterráneo) que quiere cargarse la democracia | Ideas | EL PAÍS _ _ _ _ Seleccione: - - - España América México Colombia Chile Argentina US Español US English Ideas suscríbete H HOLA Iniciar sesión Ideas en portada NRx: el movimiento (subterráneo) que quiere cargarse la democracia Creen que la democracia es un error y que la igualdad no es un fin deseable. Consideran que hay que gobernar el Estado como una empresa, con un presidente imperial y tecnoautoritario. El movimiento neorreaccionario NRx ya ha conseguido filtrar sus ideas en la derecha populista de Trump y en Silicon Valley En las cerillas, Curtis Yarvin y Nick Land, ideólogos del movimiento neorreaccionario. Sr. García Sergio C. Fanjul 24 nov 2024 - 05:30 CET Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Bluesky Linkedin Copiar enlace Comentarios El futuro podría ser una neomonarquía ultracapitalista e hipertecnológica. Es lo que propone, lejos de otros imaginarios futuristas más extendidos, el movimiento de la neorreacción (NRx), también conocido como la Ilustración oscura. Considera que la democracia liberal es un error y que la igualdad no es un fin deseable. Todo es una farsa. Aboga por el tecnoautoritarismo: la sociedad debe regirse por un rey / consejero delegado (CEO), como una empresa muy jerarquizada de la que los ciudadanos serían los accionistas. Son ideas, rodeadas de un halo underground , oscurantista y sombrío, que tienen conexión con la alt-right y podrían infiltrarse en el próximo gobierno de Donald Trump a través de los magnates de Silicon Valley . Las ideas ilustradas de racionalidad y progreso ya habían sido criticadas con anterioridad por la Escuela de Fráncfort o los posmodernos : aquellos (en apariencia) luminosos ideales habían llevado al control y la dominación, a la justificación del colonialismo, a la sofisticación tecnológica de la guerra o a la destrucción de la naturaleza. La NRx es una crítica a la Ilustración desde posiciones de ultraderecha: si la ilustración en inglés se dice iluminación ( enlightenment ), la Ilustración oscura ( dark enlightenment ) es un inquietante oxímoron que propone una mezcla del Antiguo Régimen con la ideología de Silicon Valley para llegar a una solución pragmática, pero elitista, que restaure el orden y la estabilidad en tiempos turbulentos. “En su opinión, si el mercado no es democrático desde un punto de vista igualitario, si en el mercado Elon Musk y yo jamás seremos iguales… ¿Qué sentido tiene la democracia?”, explica Jaime Caro, doctor en Historia e investigador de la extrema derecha y también parte del equipo de discurso de Sumar. Más información ¿Es Trump un fascista? La NRx es subterránea: no tiene líderes visibles, ni organizaciones sólidas, ni el respaldo de think tanks . Sus ideas afloran en concentraciones conservadoras, podcasts o blogs marginales. “Sería difícil encontrar a más de un puñado de personas fuera del movimiento conservador que conozca estas ideas”, dice Mike Wendling, autor de Alt-right: La derecha alternativa. De 4chan a la Casa Blanca (Antonio Machado Libros, 2023), “pero, en cierto modo, eso es una ventaja”. La verdadera influencia de la neorreación no es su presencia como tal, sino la manera en la que, sibilinamente, se ha infiltrado en diferentes ámbitos, desde el citado Silicon Valley hasta el movimiento MAGA (Make America Great Again) de apoyo a Trump, pasando por el universo de las criptomonedas o el propio Partido Republicano. “Elon Musk es el ejemplo más notable, pero hay muchos otros. Estas personas tienden a creer que son los amos del universo y quieren menos regulación al tiempo que desean aprovechar los contratos gubernamentales”, dice Wendling. La creciente visión de la población migrante como mano de obra temporal y transitoria en vez de la idea tradicional de aquellos que llegan persiguiendo el sueño americano también tiene raigambre neorreacionaria. El ingeniero Curtis Yarvin, uno de sus promotores, presume de que su postura es siempre la opuesta a la de Chomsky Fruto de la desafección conservadora Movimientos como la NRx surgen de la desafección por la derecha tradicional estadounidense iniciada en los últimos compases del mandato de George W. Bush, tras la guerra de Irak y al calor del colapso económico. “Estas circunstancias parecían indicar que la versión de Bush del conservadurismo estaba desacreditada y abrían una oportunidad para alternativas de derecha”, explica George Hawley, profesor de la Universidad de Alabama y autor de The Alt-right, what Everyone Needs to Know , de Oxford University Press (La alt-right , lo que todos necesitamos saber, sin traducción al español). De ese caldo de cultivo surgió el movimiento Tea Party que luego enfrentó con virulencia a Barack Obama en una deriva libertariana y populista, pero no muy alejada del marco habitual. Paralelamente comenzaban a aparecer las ideas neorreaccionarias más marginales, convencidas de que la derecha tradicional era incapaz de lograr cambios estructurales. Es fácil imaginar a Curtis Yarvin por aquellos tiempos en una habitación en penumbra, iluminado por la pantalla del ordenador, dándole a la tecla con ansias de transgresión. Es un ingeniero informático neoyorquino, exprogresista (perdió su “confianza”), y hasta entonces desconocido, que comenzó a desarrollar el corpus ideológico bajo el seudónimo de Mencius Moldbug, en su blog Unqualified Reservations (reservas sin matices), inaugurado en 2007. En ese espacio Moldbug promete “curar tu cerebro”, ofreciéndole al lector una píldora roja (en referencia la película Matrix ) que le liberará de las ideas del pensador de izquierdas Noam Chomsky (el autor presume de que su postura ante cualquier asunto es la opuesta a la de Chomsky). Se declara, en cambio, seguidor de Thomas Carlyle , filósofo escocés del siglo XIX, que desconfiaba de la igualdad y la democracia y proponía un “gobierno de los héroes”, los individuos excepcionales que protagonizan la historia y deben guiar a la sociedad (como los hombres históricos de Hegel, que encarnan el zeitgeist , es decir, el espíritu de su época). El influjo del anarcocapitalista alemán contemporáneo Hans-Hermann Hoppe o del neofascista filonazi y ocultista Julius Evola también hizo al ingeniero desconfiar de la democracia y explorar alternativas autoritarias y monárquicas. En esa línea escribe el propio Moldbug: “Nuestro problema es la democracia. La democracia es una forma de gobierno peligrosa y maligna que tiende a degenerar, a veces lentamente y otras con una rapidez impactante y desgarradora, en tiranía y caos”. Trump sería un héroe mesiánico destinado a salvar al país de ese Estado Profundo, considerado pederasta y satánico La victoria de Trump en 2016 , con sus maneras autoritarias, su alejamiento de los valores conservadores establecidos y su desafío a los medios de comunicación y a las normas políticas, parecía estar en sintonía con los postulados de la NRx y probablemente colaboró a alentar esas ideas. La NRx cree que es preciso combatir un conglomerado que ejerce el control ideológico, bautizado como la Catedral (algo así como la hegemonía gramsciana ), donde se reúnen los medios, las universidades, etcétera, para mantener el statu quo . La píldora roja que ofrece Yarvin, ya un icono de esta derecha disidente, es la que ayuda a escapar de esta matrix . Aunque la propuesta de la NRx, bien pensado, no se diferencia mucho del futuro distópico descrito en la ciencia ficción ciberpunk: grandes corporaciones que dominan una sociedad hipertecnologizada. Una tecnocracia tremendamente desigual, que también recuerda al tecnofeudalismo, en el que el poder se concentra en grandes corporaciones de las que la ciudadanía depende para los aspectos más fundamentales de su vida. Curar al Estado de la democracia La Catedral es una idea que conecta con la noción de Deep State (Estado Profundo) que manejan teorías de la conspiración como QAnon . En este marco, Trump sería un héroe mesiánico que vendría a salvar a Estados Unidos de ese Estado Profundo (considerado pederasta y satánico) y de la “ciénaga” de Washington. “La NRx también está conectada con la alt-right en cuanto a las ideas de supremacismo blanco y antifeminismo”, apunta Caro, “aunque la NRx tiene un carácter más elitista y menos popular que la derecha alternativa”. Yarvin ha caído en opiniones supremacistas blancas, le ha quitado hierro al nazismo o ha sugerido que algunas razas son más propicias a la esclavitud que otras, aunque por lo general el foco de la NRx está más puesto en lo tecnológico y lo libertariano. Y aun procediendo de esas ideas libertarianas y de la escuela austriaca de economía (como seguidor de Friedrich Hayek ), reconoce que el Estado no puede ser eliminado, pero “por lo menos puede ser curado de la democracia”, según escribe Nick Land . Curtis Yarvin, a la izquierda, y Nick Land, ideólogos del movimiento NRx. Wikipedia / Robert Johnson (cedida por la Editorial Holobionte) Este excéntrico y oscuro filósofo británico, creador de textos alucinados de teoría-ficción y considerado origen del aceleracionismo (un caldo de cultivo del que también surgió otro célebre pensador: Mark Fisher), fue quien, en una segunda fase de su pensamiento, tomó las ideas de Yarvin y las desarrolló bajo el nombre de Ilustración oscura, añadiéndole toques de futurismo transhumano. La Ilustración oscura coincide en ese neocameralismo en el que se gobierna un Estado como una empresa, en busca de la máxima eficiencia y rentabilidad y sin tener que constreñirse al cortoplacismo democrático. Cada Estado lucharía por retener a sus clientes y tratar de que no se fueran, descontentos, a otro Estado. “Land insiste en que la democracia es un mal y expone un darwinismo social muy fuerte”, explica Caro, “la gente no es fuerte, es dependiente de los demás. El mejor sistema de gobierno es un Estado controlado por corporaciones tecnológicas, en el que deberías comprar más acciones para tener más voz”. Peter Thiel , cofundador de PayPal, es otro de los pilares del movimiento, como ferviente financiador de Yarvin y la neorreacción desde sus inicios. El magnate de Silicon Valley también ha financiado al Seastanding Institute , fundado por Patri Friedman (nieto del pope neoliberal Milton Friedman ), que pretende crear utopías anarcocapitalistas en islas y plataformas marítimas situadas en aguas internacionales, donde, como en el neocameralismo de Yarvin, los modos de gobernanza evolucionen en competencia según una lógica de mercado. “No creo que democracia y libertad sean compatibles”, escribió el multimillonario, en 2009, en un texto para el think tank libertariano Instituto Cato. El cofundador de PayPal, Peter Thiel, habla durante la Conferencia del Bitcoin de 2022 en Miami, Florida. Marco Bello (Getty Images) Thiel es, además, el gran padrino de J. D. Vance , próximo vicepresidente de los Estados Unidos (que además es seguidor de Yarvin). Steve Bannon , que fuera gurú de Trump, también ha tenido contactos con el fundador de la NRx. Estas conexiones dan una idea de lo cerca que la neorreacción puede estar del próximo Gobierno en la Casa Blanca, mientras el conservadurismo tradicional sigue tratando de encontrar su sitio. “Es cierto que Vance muestra familiaridad con las ideas de la NRx”, explica Hawley. “Es menos evidente que estas ideas impulsen su filosofía de gobierno, aunque está claro que está menos enamorado del conservadurismo tradicional que muchos otros líderes republicanos. No tengo información privilegiada para confirmar esto, pero sospecho firmemente que Trump no tiene ningún conocimiento sobre la NRx”. Influencia neorreaccionaria Está por ver la influencia que tendrá el vicepresidente en el nuevo Gobierno, aunque el mayor impacto de la NRx se podría dar en el ámbito de la regulación tecnológica y de las criptomonedas, que podrían ser más flexibles. “Más generalmente, los neorreaccionarios están entusiasmados con la perspectiva de una presidencia imperial, donde el poder se concentra en manos de un solo hombre, con pocos controles y equilibrios sobre ese poder”, señala Wendling. Un poder que seguramente será puesto en solfa por los gobiernos progresistas locales y estatales, y también por los sectores republicanos moderados. No son muchas personas las que conocen a estos autores y estas ideas, que mantienen cierta pátina transgresora. “Sin embargo, algunas de ellas, a menudo de forma parcial y sin citar el autor, circulan en redes cada vez más. Su influencia es creciente: baste pensar que empresarios tan poderosos e influyentes como Thiel o Musk las promueven”, dice el historiador Steven Forti , autor de Extrema derecha 2.0 (Siglo XXI, 2021). El caldo de cultivo es favorable porque los algoritmos favorecen la difusión de contenido extremista. Las teorías de la conspiración, con sus soluciones simples a la complejidad, suelen encontrar adeptos. Y la simpatía por los líderes autoritarios crece al tiempo que la desafección por la democracia. “¿Resulta tan extraño, por consiguiente, que haya gente que empiece a creerse estas teorías?”, se pregunta Forti. La Ilustración sigue siendo enemiga de la extrema derecha en el siglo XXI, como se ve en el caso de la primera ministra italiana, Giorgia Meloni, o el filósofo nacionalista ruso Alexander Dugin , y como lo fue en el siglo XX para el filósofo de extrema derecha Julius Evola o para el fundador del movimiento ultra francés Nouvelle Droite , Alain de Benoist. Aunque el neoliberalismo, con su fomento del individualismo y la competitividad y su deterioro de lo común, también ha hecho mella en los valores de bienestar social y fraternidad ilustrados. Al aumentar la desigualdad, ha desvirtuado los valores democráticos. “La NRx dice abrazar el colapso de Occidente y las fuerzas del caos; pero, como ha escrito Claudio Kulesko, esas fuerzas del caos son algo que ni ellos mismos podrían controlar”, concluye Federico Fernández Giordiano, editor de algunas obras de Nick Land en el sello Holobionte . “Su error es pretender extraer un orden premoderno y cameralista del futuro; pero el caos siempre produce novedad, y por tanto su trayectoria no puede fijarse en ninguna configuración del pasado”. Y añade: “Sea lo que sea lo que surja del caos (o del colapso del orden mundial), no será lo que ellos esperan”.

Guest stuns Rogan with wild Biden claim,News.com.au,30/11/2024,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/banking/billionaire-investor-says-30-tech-founders-have-been-debanked-in-last-four-years/news-story/4161f4fe27dded8f3baa197237bd5c5d,"Dozens of tech and crypto start-up founders have been “debanked” and forced out of the industry over the past four years as part of a shadowy pressure campaign waged by the Biden administration against its “political enemies”, a prominent billionaire has claimed. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and a key ally of Elon Musk, left podcast host Joe Rogan stunned on Wednesday after revealing the scale of “raw administrative power” quietly being wielded behind the scenes by “unaccountable” agencies. Mr Andreessen said tech founders worth millions of dollars had been forced to change fields and in some cases leave the country entirely to escape the “Eye of Sauron”, in the hope of eventually being able to use banks again. “We’ve had like 30 founders debanked in the last four years,” Mr Andreessen said. “It’s been a big recurring pattern. This is one of the reasons why we ended up supporting Trump. We just can’t live in a world where somebody starts a company that’s a completely legal thing and then they literally get sanctioned, embargoed by the US government. No due process, none of this is written down, there’s no rules, there’s no court, there’s no decision process, there’s no appeal. Who do you go to to get your bank account back?” The prominent Silicon Valley investor was one of a number of high-profile entrepreneurs from the so-called “PayPal Mafia” — former founders or employees of the payments platform — who publicly backed Donald Trump this election, in part due to his tech and crypto-friendly policies. Mr Musk has been tapped by Mr Trump to lead a cost-cutting and deregulation drive dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and has previously expressed astonishment that there are more than 450 US federal agencies, more than the number of years the country has existed. Mr Andreessen said much of the debanking had been driven by “independent federal agencies” like the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was used to “basically terrorise financial institutions (to) prevent new start-ups, new competition that want to compete with the big banks”. “Under current banking regulations after all the reforms of the last 20 years, there’s now a category called a politically exposed person, PEP, and if you are a PEP you are required by financial regulators to kick them out of your bank,” he said.

No one on the left gets debanked. I have not heard of a single instance of anybody on the left getting debanked.” “How is that legal?” Rogan asked. Marc Andreessen speaking to Joe Rogan. Picture: YouTube Marc Andreessen speaking to Joe Rogan. Picture: YouTube Mr Andreessen noted that while the US Constitution prevented the government restricting speech, “there’s no constitutional amendment that says the government can’t debank you”. “They don’t have to debank you, they just have to put pressure on the private company banks to do it,” he said. “So it’s basically a privatised sanctions regime that lets bureaucrats do to American citizens the same thing that we do to Iran.” He added, “When Trump says the ‘deep state’, the way we would describe it is it’s administrative power. It’s political power being administered not through legislation, there’s no defined law that covers this, it’s not through regulation, you can’t go sue a regulator to fix this, it’s not through any kind of court judgment, it’s just raw administrative power.” He explained that the process began around 15 years ago under the Obama administration’s “Operation Chokepoint”, which targeted “legal fields of economic activity they don’t like” such as medicinal marijuana, prostitution and guns. “And then this administration extended that concept to apply it to tech founders, crypto founders and then just generally political opponents,” he said. “Chokepoint 2.0 is primarily against their political enemies and disfavoured tech start-ups. It’s hit the tech world hard.” Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Picture: Brandon Bell/Getty Images/AFP Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Picture: Brandon Bell/Getty Images/AFP Mr Andreessen blamed much of the slowdown in the crypto space in recent years on debanking. “The last four years, the crypto thing everybody got excited, NFTs and all that stuff, and then it just stopped,” he said. “The reason it stopped is because basically every crypto founder, every crypto start-up, they either got debanked personally and forced out of the industry, or their company got debanked so it couldn’t keep operating, or they got prosecuted and charged.” He said one of his own employees had lost his bank account simply for having the word “crypto” in his job title. “(The bank) did a screen across their customer base,” he said. “Anybody with ‘crypto’ became a ‘politically exposed person’, because crypto was politically controversial.” “If someone has $30 million in the bank and they get debanked what do they do with their money?” Rogan asked. “You go to cash. Diamonds, art. You go overseas somewhere,” Mr Andreessen said. “When we think about totalitarianism we think about World War II, Nazis and jackboots with tanks and guns. You might call that hard totalitarianism. But there’s this other version you might call soft totalitarianism, which is just rules and power exercised arbitrarily that just simply suppresses everything. This is speech control and debanking and all these other things.” Mr Andreessen claimed the Biden administration had planned “full government control” over AI companies to enforce a “censorship regime”. “If you thought social media censorship was bad this has the potential to be 1000 times worse,” he said.

AI is going to be the control layer on everything — how your kids learn in school, who gets loans, does your house open when you come to the front door. So if that gets wired into the political system … we are in for a very bad future. The Biden administration was explicitly on that path, it’s crystal clear that’s where it was headed.” Mr Andreessen joked that like in a science fiction movie the timeline had “split twice in the last nine months”. “The first was when Trump got shot ... it could have gone horrifically bad for the entire world,” he said. “And then the timeline split again on election day.”",997
NRx: The (underground) movement that wants to destroy democracy,El País,30/11/2024,https://english.elpais.com/usa/2024-11-30/nrx-the-underground-movement-that-wants-to-destroy-democracy.html,"NRx: The (underground) movement that wants to destroy democracy | U.S. | EL PAÍS English _ _ _ _ Select: - - - España América México Colombia Chile Argentina US Español US English U.S. subscribe H HOLA LOG IN U.S. Joseph Biden Donald Trump Latest News USA NRx: The (underground) movement that wants to destroy democracy The neo-reactionary movement, also known as the Dark Enlightenment, believes that democracy is a mistake and that equality is not a desirable goal. Those who adhere to it believe that the state should be governed like a company, with an imperial and techno-authoritarian president. Practically clandestine, it has already managed to infiltrate Trump’s populist right and Silicon Valley Curtis Yarvin and Nick Land, ideologues of the neo-reactionary movement. Sr. García Sergio C. Fanjul Nov 30, 2024 - 05:05 CET Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Bluesky Linkedin Copy link The future could be an ultra-capitalist and hyper-technological neo-monarchy. Beyond other, more widespread futuristic imaginings, this is what’s proposed by the neo-reactionary movement (NRx), also known as the Dark Enlightenment. Those who adhere to it believe that liberal democracy is a mistake and that equality isn’t a desirable end. In short, it’s all a farce. NRx advocates in favor of techno-authoritarianism: that societies should be governed by a king-CEO… like a highly hierarchical company, with citizens acting as veritable shareholders. These are ideas — surrounded by an underground, obscurantist and gloomy halo — that have a connection with the alt-right . And they could infiltrate Donald Trump’s next administration through the magnates of Silicon Valley. The Enlightenment ideas were previously criticized by the Frankfurt School, or the postmodernists: those (apparently) luminous ideals of Eurocentric “rationality” and “progress” had led to control and domination, the justification of colonialism, as well as the technological sophistication of war and the industrialized destruction of nature. NRx, on the other hand, is a critique of the Enlightenment from far-right positions. The “Dark” Enlightenment is a disturbing oxymoron that proposes a mix of the ancien régime with the ideology of Silicon Valley. The goal is to reach a pragmatic — yet elitist — solution that restores order and stability in turbulent times. “In their opinion, if the market isn’t democratic from an egalitarian point of view — if, in the market, Elon Musk and I will never be equal — what’s the point of democracy?” explains Jaime Caro, a historian who researches the extreme-right. NRx is a clandestine movement: it has no visible leaders, no solid organizations, nor the official backing of think tanks. Its ideas emerge in conservative rallies, podcasts, or marginal blogs. “It would be difficult to find more than a handful of people outside the conservative movement who know about these ideas,” says Mike Wendling, author of Alt-Right: From 4Chan to the White House (2018). “But, in a way, that’s an advantage,” he adds. The true influence of the neo-reactionary movement isn’t its presence as such, but rather the way in which it has slyly infiltrated different areas, from Silicon Valley to Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, through the universe of cryptocurrencies , or the Republican Party. “Elon Musk is the most notable example, but there are many others. These people tend to believe that they’re the masters of the universe: they want fewer regulations, while wanting to take advantage of government contracts,” Wendling sighs. The growing perception of the migrant population as simply being temporary and transient labor — instead of the traditional idea of those who arrive being in pursuit of the American dream — also has neo-reactionary roots. Curtis Yarvin, one of the movement’s promoters, boasts that his position is always the opposite of Noam Chomsky’s. The product of conservative disaffection Movements like NRx emerged from the disaffection with the traditional American right. This began in the final stages of George W. Bush’s administration (2001-2009), following the U.S. invasion of Iraq and amid the financial crisis. “These circumstances seemed to indicate that Bush’s version of conservatism was discredited and opened up an opportunity for right-wing alternatives,” explains George Hawley, a professor at the University of Alabama and author of The Alt-Right: What Everyone Needs to Know (2018). From this breeding ground emerged the Tea Party movement , which fiercely confronted Barack Obama in a libertarian and populist drift… but without straying far from the usual right-wing framework. At the same time, more marginal neo-reactionary ideas began to appear, convinced that the traditional right was incapable of achieving structural changes. In those days, it’s easy to imagine Curtis Yarvin in a dimly lit room, illuminated by the computer screen, typing away with a desire for transgression. He’s a computer engineer from New York and a former progressive who began to develop his ideas under the pseudonym of Mencius Moldbug. He writes on his blog, Unqualified Reservations , which he launched in 2007. In that space, Moldbug promises to “cure your brain,” offering readers a so-called “red pill” (in reference to the film The Matrix ) that will free them from the ideas of left-wing thinker Chomsky. Moldbug is a declared follower of Thomas Carlyle, a 19th-century Scottish philosopher who distrusted equality and democracy. He proposed a “government of heroes,” exceptional individuals who are the protagonists of history and must guide their societies (like Hegel’s “great men,” who embody the zeitgeist or spirit of their times). The influence of the contemporary German anarcho-capitalist Hans-Hermann Hoppe — or the neo-fascist, Nazi occultist Julius Evola — also led the software engineer to distrust democracy and explore authoritarian and monarchical alternatives. Along these lines, Moldbug himself writes that democracy is a “dangerous, malignant form of government which tends to degenerate, sometimes slowly and sometimes with shocking, gut-wrenching speed, into tyranny and chaos.” The movement portrays Trump as a messianic hero, destined to save the country from the so-called “ Deep State ,” which is considered to be pedophilic and satanic. Trump’s 2016 victory — with his authoritarian ways, his departure from established conservative values, and his challenge to the media and political norms — seemed to be in tune with the tenets of NRx and likely helped encourage these ideas. NRx believes that it’s necessary to combat a conglomerate that exercises ideological control — dubbed “the Cathedral” (something like Gramscian hegemony) — where major media outlets, universities, and other elite institutions meet to maintain the status quo. The “red pill” offered by Yarvin — already an icon of this dissident right — is the one that supposedly helps you escape from this matrix. Upon reflection, the NRx proposal isn’t very different from the dystopian future described in cyberpunk science fiction, in which large corporations dominate a hyper-technological society. Such a tremendously unequal technocracy is also known as technofeudalism , in which power is concentrated in large corporations, which citizens depend on for the most fundamental aspects of their lives. Healing the state of democracy The Cathedral is a concept that connects with the notion of the Deep State… conspiracies pedaled by QAnon . In this framework, Trump is a messianic hero who has come to save the United States from said Deep State and from the “swamp” that is Washington, D.C. “NRx is also connected to the alt-right in terms of ideas of white supremacy and anti-feminism,” Caro points out, “although NRx has a more elitist and less popular character than the alt-right.” Yarvin has fallen into white supremacist opinions, has downplayed Nazism, or has suggested that certain races are more conducive to being enslaved than others… although, generally speaking, NRx is more focused on technological and libertarian ideas. Coming from the Austrian school of economics, as a devout follower of Friedrich Hayek, Yarvin recognizes that the state cannot be eliminated, but “at least it can be cured of democracy,” as Nick Land writes. Curtis Yarvin, left, and Nick Land, ideologues of the NRx movement. Wikipedia / Robert Johnson (cedida por la Editorial Holobionte) Land, an eccentric and obscure British philosopher, writes hallucinatory texts of theory-fiction. He’s considered to be the founder of accelerationism, a breeding ground from which another famous thinker also emerged: Mark Fisher (1968-2017). Land has taken Yarvin’s ideas and has developed them under the name of the Dark Enlightenment, adding touches of transhuman futurism. The Dark Enlightenment overlaps with the system of neo-cameralism, in which a state is governed like a company, in search of maximum efficiency and profitability, without having to constrain itself to democratic, short-term goals. Each state would fight to retain its clients and try to prevent them from becoming dissatisfied and leaving for another state. “Land insists that democracy is evil and [proposes] a very strong social Darwinism,” Caro explains. “People aren’t strong, they’re dependent on others. [Therefore, according to him], the best system of government is a state controlled by technological corporations, in which you should buy more shares to have more say.” Peter Thiel , a co-founder of PayPal, is another pillar of the movement. He’s been a fervent financier of Yarvin and other neo-reactionaries since the movement’s beginnings. The Silicon Valley magnate has also financed the Seastanding Institute — founded by Patri Friedman, the grandson of the neoliberal godfather, Milton Friedman — which aims to create anarcho-capitalist utopias on islands, as well as maritime platforms located in international waters. These sites would be governed according to Yarvin’s notion of neo-cameralism. In 2009, in a text for the libertarian Cato Institute, the multibillionaire Thiel wrote: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel speaks during the 2022 Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida. Marco Bello (Getty Images) Thiel is also the mentor and benefactor of Senator J. D. Vance , the vice president-elect of the United States (as well as a follower of Yarvin). Steve Bannon, who was Trump’s guru, has also had contact with the founder of NRx. These connections offer an idea about how close the neo-reactionary movement may be to the next administration in the White House. Traditional conservatism, meanwhile, is still trying to find its place. “It’s true that Vance [is familiar] with NRx ideas,” Hawley explains. “It’s less evident that these ideas drive his governing philosophy… although it’s clear that he’s less enamored with traditional conservatism than many other Republican leaders. I don’t have inside information to confirm this, but I strongly suspect that Trump has no knowledge of NRx.” Neo-reactionary influence It remains to be seen how much influence the vice president will have on the new government. However, the greatest impact of NRx could be in more flexible areas, such as technological regulations and cryptocurrencies. “More generally, neo-reactionaries are excited by the prospect of an imperial presidency, where power is concentrated in the hands of a single man, with few checks and balances on that power,” Wendling notes. This power will surely be questioned by progressive local and state governments, as well as by moderate Republican sectors. Not many people know about these authors and these ideas, which retain a certain transgressive tint. However, some of them — often only partially and without the authors being cited — “are circulating on social media more and more. Their influence is growing: just think that businessmen as powerful and influential as Thiel or Musk promote them,” says historian Steven Forti, author of Extreme Rights 2.0, A Big Global Family (2021). The breeding ground is fertile, because algorithms favor the spread of extremist content. Conspiracy theories — with their simple solutions to complexity — often find followers. And sympathy for authoritarian leaders grows as disaffection in democracy grows. “Is it so strange, then, that there are people who are starting to believe these theories?” Forti asks. The Enlightenment remains the enemy of the far right in the 21st century. This has been made clear by the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, or Russian nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin. And such was the case in the 20th century as well, with, for instance, the far-right philosopher Julius Evola, or journalist Alain de Benoist, a founding member of the Nouvelle Droite (France’s New Right). But neoliberalism, with its promotion of individualism and competitiveness, as well as its deterioration of the common space, has also made a dent in the values of social welfare and fraternity. By increasing inequality, it has distorted democratic values. “NRx claims to embrace the collapse of the West and the forces of chaos… but, as Claudio Kulesko has written, these forces of chaos are something that not even they could control,” concludes Federico Fernández Giordiano, who has edited the Spanish translations of Nick Land’s works. “Their mistake is to try to extract a pre-modern and cameralist order from the future. But chaos always produces novelty. Therefore, its trajectory cannot be fixed in any configuration from the past.” He adds: “Whatever emerges from chaos (or from the collapse of the world order), it won’t be what [the neo-reactionaries] expect.” From left, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and future vice president J.

Peter Thiel has praised Elon Musk's attitude to risk and said it's a bad idea to bet against him. The world's richest person understands risk in a way that most people don't, Thiel said. ""Peter is right on all counts,"" Musk posted on X in agreement with some of Thiel's comments. Elon Musk's entry into politics has caused some trepidation in Washington circles. But his former business partner and fellow billionaire Peter Thiel has a message for the DC establishment: ""You should never bet against Elon."" Thiel discussed Musk's unique skill as an entrepreneur during an appearance on the latest episode of the talk show ""Piers Morgan Uncensored,"" which was released Thursday. Thiel said that in the 2000s, Silicon Valley just viewed Musk as someone building two ""super crazy"" companies — his car company, Tesla , and rocket company, SpaceX. ""If only one of them had succeeded, one might still have said that it was just extraordinarily lucky,"" Thiel said. ""The fact that, to first approximation, both have succeeded — have wildly succeeded — I always want to say it tells us something that, you know, Elon knows something about risk the rest of us don't."" He added that it appeared to be a ""high-wire, crazy, risk-taking act"" from the outside, but Musk's methods somehow worked. Thiel said he'd asked Musk before about how he approaches risk. ""I think there is something he understands about it we don't. It's hard to articulate. I don't know if he can articulate it,"" he said. The two billionaires formed PayPal in 2000 after merging their two companies. Thiel has since cofounded Palantir, founded the venture-capital fund Founders Fund, and started the Thiel Fellowship. He's an outspoken libertarian and generous donator to the Republican Party. Thiel and Elon Musk are both members of the PayPal Mafia. AP Musk's business strategies have come under scrutiny since he was appointed to head the Trump administration's new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE . Related stories His goal is to significantly reduce the federal budget, cutting as much as $2 trillion in spending. ""The strong consensus view in the DC establishment is that this is going to go nowhere. That it's just absolutely impossible to fix things, and this is going to be a very frustrating dead end,"" Thiel said during the interview. ""The alternate view, I would say, is you should never bet against Elon,"" he said. ""Peter is right on all counts,"" Musk posted on X in response to the interview clip on DOGE. Musk's businesses have seemed to thrive since the election in a phenomenon dubbed the "" Trump bump ,"" as investors and analysts wager he'll continue to play a leading role in the new administration. This week, SpaceX was valued at $350 billion, doubling its worth in a year. Tesla has also enjoyed a major rally, with shares surging more than 60% this year.

Sam Altman says Trump could be a 'visionary leader' by backing AI infrastructure,MarketWatch,01/12/2024,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sam-altman-says-trump-could-be-a-visionary-leader-by-backing-ai-infrastructure-9b22ba50,"OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman gave President-elect Donald Trump advice on how to accelerate the artificial-intelligence revolution at the FinRegLab AI Symposium in Washington on Thursday. ‘Unlike other types of software, AI needs huge amounts of infrastructure — power, chips, massive data centers — and the U.S. has, at other times in our history, under a visionary leader, decided to really get behind a massive infrastructure buildup for national prosperity and security. I would love to see President Trump really go after that.’ — Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI The tech entrepreneur has raised billions of dollars to fund OpenAI from outside investors, as well as its partner Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.51% But Altman argued that the federal government should also take a role in fostering the industry’s growth and ensuring that AI technology can be used safely. He said Thursday that he is particularly excited about AI’s potential to revolutionize the financial-services industry, though he cautioned that the technology should be applied to “less sensitive use cases first.” Altman also called for the creation of a federal oversight body that could ensure that AI technology is safe before it is released to the public. “There should be some sort of federal testing framework that says, here’s the dangers we’re most interested in monitoring and mitigating,” he said. “Here’s a set of tests, and before you can release it, you know you have to be able to certify — like you would for a new driver, a new airplane, or whatever — that this model is safe in these ways.”",1567

Sam Altman [archival audio]: We have been a misunderstood and badly mocked org for a long time. When we started and said we were going to work on a AGI, people thought we were batshit insane. Michael Calore: Sam Altman is the CEO and one of the founders of OpenAI, the generative AI company that launched ChatGPT about two years ago, and essentially ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence. This is WIRED&#x27;s Uncanny Valley , a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. Today on the show, we&#x27;re doing a deep dive on Sam Altman, from his Midwest roots to his early startup days, his time as a venture capitalist, and his rise and fall and rise again at OpenAI. We&#x27;re going to look at it all while asking, is this the man we should trust to guide our explorations into artificial intelligence, and do we even have a choice? I&#x27;m Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED. Lauren Goode: I&#x27;m Lauren Goode. I&#x27;m a senior writer at WIRED. Zoë Schiffer: I&#x27;m Zoe Schiffer, WIRED&#x27;s director of business and industry. Michael Calore: OK. I want to start today by going back one year into the past, November 2023, to an event that we refer to as the blip. Lauren Goode: The blip. We don&#x27;t just refer to it as the blip. That is actually the internal phrase that is used at OpenAI to describe some of the most chaotic three to four days in that company&#x27;s history. [archival audio]: The company OpenAI, one of the top players in artificial intelligence, thrown into disarray . [archival audio]: One of the most spectacular corporate fall-outs . [archival audio]: The news on Wall Street today involves the stunning developments in the world of artificial intelligence . Zoë Schiffer: It really started on November 17th, this Friday afternoon when Sam Altman, the CEO of the company, gets what he says is the most surprising, shocking, and difficult news of his professional career. [archival audio]: The shock dismissal of former boss, Sam Altman . [archival audio]: His firing sent shock waves through Silicon Valley . Zoë Schiffer: The board at OpenAI, which at the time was a nonprofit, has lost confidence in him, it says. Despite the fact that the company is by all measures doing incredibly well, he&#x27;s out. He&#x27;s no longer going to lead the company. Michael Calore: He&#x27;s effectively fired from the company that he cofounded. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. That immediately sets off a chain reaction of events. His cofounder and president of the company, Greg Brockman, resigns in solidarity. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that Sam Altman is actually going to join Microsoft and lead an advanced AI research team there. Then we see almost the entire employee base at OpenAI sign a letter saying, “Wait, wait, wait. If Sam leaves, we&#x27;re leaving, too.” [archival audio]: Some 500 of these 700-odd employees— [archival audio]: … threatening to quit over the board&#x27;s abrupt firing of OpenAI&#x27;s popular CEO, Sam Altman . Zoë Schiffer: Eventually there&#x27;s this back and forth tense negotiation between Sam Altman and the board of directors, and eventually the board then installs Mira Murati, the CTO, as the interim CEO. Then shortly after that, Sam is able to reach an agreement with the board and he returns as CEO and the board looks instantly different, with Brett Taylor and Larry Summers joining, Adam D&#x27;Angelo staying, and the rest of the board leaving. Michael Calore: All of this happened over a weekend in the first couple of days of the following week. It ruined a lot of our weekends as technology journalists. I&#x27;m sure it ruined a lot of weekends for everybody in the generative AI industry, but for a lot of people who don&#x27;t follow this stuff, it was the first time that they heard of Sam Altman, first time maybe they heard about OpenAI. Why was this important? Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. This was such an interesting moment, because it surprised me. Lauren, I&#x27;m curious if it surprised you that this story broke through on such a national scale. People went from not really knowing who Sam Altman was to being shocked and disturbed that he was fired from his own company. Lauren Goode: I think at this moment, everyone was hearing about generative AI and how it was going to change our lives. Sam was now officially the face of this, and it took this chaos, this Silicon Valley drama to bring that to the forefront, because then in trying to understand what was happening with the mutiny, you got a sense of there are these people in these different camps of AI. Some who believe in artificial general intelligence, that eventually it&#x27;s going to totally take over our lives. Some who fall in the camp of accelerationists who believe that AI should just scale as quickly as possible, unfettered AI. Others who are a little bit more cautious in their approach and believe that there should be safety measures and guardrails put around AI. All of these things came into sharp focus through this one very long, chaotic weekend. Michael Calore: We&#x27;re going to talk a lot about Sam on this episode, and I want to make sure that we get a sense of who he is as a person. How do we know him? How do we understand him as a person? What&#x27;s his vibe? Zoë Schiffer: Well, I think Lauren might be the only one who&#x27;s actually met him. Is that right? Lauren Goode: Yeah. I have met him a few times, and my first interaction with Sam goes back about a decade. He&#x27;s around 29 years old, and he is the president of Y Combinator, which is this very well-known startup incubator here in Silicon Valley. The idea is that all these startups pitch their ideas and they get a very small amount of seed funding, but they also get a lot of coaching and mentorship. The person who&#x27;s running YC is really this very glorified camp counselor for Silicon Valley, and that was Sam at the time. I remember talking to him briefly at one of their YC demo days in Mountain View. He exuded a lot of energy. He&#x27;s clearly a smart guy. He comes across as friendly and open. People who know him really well will say he&#x27;s really one of the most ambitious people who they know. But at first glance, you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily think that he&#x27;s the person, fast-forward 10 years later, meeting with prime ministers and heads of state around the world to talk to them about his grand vision of artificial intelligence, and someone who&#x27;s really positioning himself to be this power monger in artificial intelligence. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. I think one of the interesting things about Sam is just that he seems like such an enigma. People have a really hard time, myself included, putting a finger on what is he all about. Should we trust this guy? I think there are other CEOs and executives in the Valley who have such brash personas, Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, that you kind of instantly feel one way or another about them. You either really like them or you&#x27;re really turned off by them, and Sam is somewhere in the middle. He seems a little more quiet, a little more thoughtful, a little more nerdy. But there&#x27;s this sense of, like Lauren said, an appetite for power that makes you pause and think, &quot;Wait. What is this guy all about? What&#x27;s in it for him?&quot; Lauren Goode: Right. He also wears a lot of Henley shirts. Now, I know this is not a fashion show. People who listen to our very first episode— Zoë Schiffer: But it&#x27;s not not. Lauren Goode: ... might be like, “Are they just going to talk about hoodies every episode?” But he wears a lot of Henleys and jeans and nice sneakers, except for when he&#x27;s meeting with heads of state, where he suits up appropriately. Zoë Schiffer: Sam, we have notes on the outfits if you want them, so call us. Michael Calore: Well, Zoe, to your point, Paul Graham, who was at one time the head of Y Combinator, the incubator that Lauren was just talking about, described Sam as extremely good at becoming powerful. It seems like he&#x27;s somebody who can read the situation and read the room and figure out where to go next before other people can figure it out. A lot of people point to parallels between Sam Altman and Steve Jobs. I feel like Steve Jobs was somebody who had a vision for the future and was able to communicate why it was important, and he had a consumer product that got people very, very excited. Sam Altman is also somebody who has a vision for the future, is able to communicate why it&#x27;s important to the rest of us, and has a product that everybody is excited about in ChatGPT. I think that&#x27;s where the parallel ends. Lauren Goode: I think just the question of is Sam Altman the Steve Jobs of this era a really good one to ask? You&#x27;re right in that they were both effectively the salespeople for products that other people made. They&#x27;re in a sense marketers. Jobs marketed the smartphone, which literally changed the world. Sam has helped productize AI, this new form of generative AI through ChatGPT. That&#x27;s a similarity. They&#x27;re both or were both extremely ambitious, enigmatic, as Zoe said, reportedly impatient. They have some employees who would follow them to the end of the earth and others who have gone running scared. They&#x27;ve both been ousted from companies they were running and then returned. Although Sam&#x27;s absence was infinitely shorter than Steve Jobs&#x27; return to Apple. I think there are some key differences though. One is that we have the benefit of hindsight with Jobs. We know what he accomplished, and we have yet to see if Altman is really going to be a defining character of AI for the next 10 or 20 or 30 years. The second thing is that while Jobs had some very real personality quirks and complexes by all accounts, I tend to see him as being put into this messianic position by his acolytes. Whereas Sam seems to really, really want to elevate himself to that position, and there are some people who are still really skeptical about that. Zoë Schiffer: That&#x27;s really interesting. Just to double-click, as the tech people say, on the salesperson analogy, that can sound a little reductive as well, but I actually think it&#x27;s a really important point, because large language models have existed. AI has existed to some extent. But if people, regular users don&#x27;t know how to use those products or interact with them, do they really break out and change the world in the way that people like Sam Wollman think they will? I would say no. His role in launching ChatGPT, which is I think by all accounts not an incredibly useful tool, but points to future uses of AI and what they could be and how it could interact with people&#x27;s everyday lives. That is a really important change and an important impact that he&#x27;s had. Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren touched on this point, too. We don&#x27;t know what the impact is going to be. We don&#x27;t have the benefit of hindsight here, and we don&#x27;t know whether these promises about how artificial intelligence is going to transform all of our lives, how those are going to play out. There are a lot of people who are very skeptical about AI, particularly artists and creative people, but also people who work in surveillance and security and the military have a fear and a healthy skepticism around AI. We&#x27;re looking at this figurehead as the person who&#x27;s going to lead us into the future where this becomes the defining technology of that future, so the question becomes, can we trust this person? Lauren Goode: I feel like Sam&#x27;s feedback to that would be, &quot;No. You shouldn&#x27;t trust me, and you shouldn&#x27;t have to.&quot; He has said in interviews before that he&#x27;s trying to set up the company where he doesn&#x27;t have quite as much power. He doesn&#x27;t have total control in that way. He has definitely hinted that he thinks a lot of the decisions governing AI should be democratic. I think it&#x27;s just again, this question of do we trust those statements or do we trust more what he&#x27;s doing, which is consolidating power and leading a for-profit company, what used to be a nonprofit. Michael Calore: Yeah. We should underscore that, that he&#x27;s always encouraging healthy debate. He encourages open dialog about what the limits of AI should be, but that still doesn&#x27;t seem to be satisfying the people who are skeptical of it. Lauren Goode: Yeah. I think it&#x27;s also important to make the distinction between people being skeptical of it and people who are fearful of it, too. There are people who are skeptical about the tech itself. There are people who are skeptical that Sam Altman may be the figurehead that we need here. Then there&#x27;s fear of the tech from some people who actually do believe in its potential to revolutionize the world, and the fear is that that may not happen necessarily in a good way. Maybe someone will use AI for bio-terrorism. Maybe someone uses AI to launch nukes. Maybe the AI itself becomes so all-knowing and powerful that it somehow becomes violent against humans. Those are some real fears that research scientists and policymakers have. The questions about Sam&#x27;s trustworthiness aren&#x27;t only from, let&#x27;s call it a capital perspective. What&#x27;s going on in terms of is OpenAI a nonprofit or a for-profit, or can we trust this man with billions of dollars in funding? It&#x27;s literally can we trust him in a sense with our lives? Zoë Schiffer: Right. It&#x27;s the degree to which we should be worried about Sam Altman is the degree to which you personally believe that artificial general intelligence is a real concern or that AI could significantly change the world in a way that could be potentially quite catastrophic. Lauren Goode: Altman was quoted in a New York magazine profile about him as saying AI is not a clean story of only benefits. Stuff is going to be lost here as it develops. It&#x27;s super relatable and natural for people to have loss aversion. They don&#x27;t want to hear stories in which they&#x27;re the casualty. Michael Calore: We have a self-appointed figurehead whether we like it or not, and we have to make decisions about whether or not this is somebody we can trust. But before we get there, we should talk about how Sam got to where he is today. What do we know about Sam Altman the man, before he was Sam Altman the tech founder? Lauren Goode: Well, he&#x27;s the oldest of four children. He comes from this Midwestern Jewish family. He grew up in St. Louis. His family, by all accounts, he had a pretty good childhood, I believe. They hung out together. They played games. I think his brother has said that Sam always needed to win those games. In high school, he comes out as gay, which was pretty unusual at the time. He said that his high school was actually quite intolerant toward gay people. At one point he gets up on stage at his school, according to this New York Magazine profile, and gives a speech about the importance of having an open society. My takeaway from that was that he was willing from an early age to be different from other people and to reject the dominant ideology. There was also this really funny section in the profile where they said that he was a boy genius, and at age 3 was fixing the family&#x27;s VCR. As the mom of a 3-year-old, I was like, what the fuck? Michael Calore: I was resetting the clock on the family VCR by 11, and I just want to say that I&#x27;m also a boy genius. Lauren Goode: It&#x27;s funny with profiles of some of these founders, because I do feel like there&#x27;s this hagiographic tendency to be like, “Of course, they were a child genius, too.” No one is ever just mid in childhood and then ends up being a billionaire. There&#x27;s always something special. Michael Calore: Right. Well, there was something special about Sam, that&#x27;s for sure. Lauren Goode: Yeah. He starts at Stanford in 2003. This is the time period when other young, ambitious people are starting companies like Facebook and LinkedIn. I think if you were smart and ambitious like Sam clearly was, you weren&#x27;t going to go into the traditional law, doctor type fields. You were going to try and start a company, which is what he does. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. He starts this company called Looped. He&#x27;s a sophomore at Stanford. He teams up with his then boyfriend, and they create what&#x27;s basically like an early Foursquare. This is when Sam gets involved with Y Combinator for the first time. He and his cofounder receive a $6,000 investment. They&#x27;re accepted into a summer founders program at Y Combinator, and this is where they get to spend a few months incubating their app with mentorship. They&#x27;re with a bunch of other nerds. There&#x27;s this great detail about how Sam worked so much during that time period that he got scurvy. Lauren Goode: Oh, my God. That also feels like mythologizing. Zoë Schiffer: It really does. Fast-forward a few years, it&#x27;s 2012. Looped has raised about $30 million in venture capital, and the company announces that it&#x27;s going to be acquired by another company for around $43 million. This sounds like a lot of money to people who don&#x27;t start apps and sell their companies, but by Silicon Valley standards, this is not really deemed a success. Sam is comfortable. He&#x27;s able to travel the world a bit, find himself, think about what he wants to do next, but there&#x27;s still a lot of ambition there, and we&#x27;re still yet to see the real Sam Altman. Lauren Goode: Does money seem like it&#x27;s a motivating force for him, or what is he after during this time period? Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. That&#x27;s a really good question, and this I think is maybe emblematic of his personality, because he doesn&#x27;t just stop there. He&#x27;s still ruminating on a lot of things. He&#x27;s still thinking a lot about technology. Then in 2014, he was tapped by Paul Graham to be president of Y Combinator, so he&#x27;s immersed himself in a bunch of other technologists with all these new ideas. Around 2015, as he&#x27;s thinking about all this stuff, that&#x27;s really when we have the seeds of OpenAI. Michael Calore: Let&#x27;s talk about Open AI. Who are the cofounders? What do the early days of the company look like, and what is its mission when it takes off? Lauren Goode: Originally, open AI is founded as this group of researchers who are coming together to explore artificial general intelligence. A group of cofounders, including Sam and Elon Musk, set up OpenAI as a nonprofit. They don&#x27;t really have a conception of having a commercial component to it or a consumer-facing app involved. It really does feel like a research org at this point, but Elon Musk in classic Elon Musk form wants to wrest more control away from the other cofounders. He tries to take it over repeatedly and floats the idea that Tesla could acquire OpenAI, and the rest of his founders reject this idea allegedly, and so ultimately Musk walks away and Sam Altman gets control of the company. Michael Calore: I think it&#x27;s important to also make the distinction that there were a lot of companies working on artificial intelligence at this time, about eight or nine years ago, and OpenAI saw themselves as the good guys in the group. Lauren Goode: That&#x27;s the open. Michael Calore: Yeah. Basically, if you&#x27;re building artificial intelligence tools, they may be harnessed by military. They may be harnessed by bad actors. They may get to the point where they become dangerous, like some of the dangers that Lauren was talking about earlier, and they saw themselves as the people who are going to do it the right way. People are going to do it so that AI can benefit society and not harm society. They wanted to make their tools available for free to as many people as possible, and they really wanted to make sure that this wasn&#x27;t just a closed box that ended up just making a few people a bunch of money while everybody else sat on the outside. Lauren Goode: That was how they conceived of being good. It was the democratization factor more than the trust and safety factor. Is that fair? Were they sitting around being like, “We&#x27;re really going to study the harms, all of the potential misuses?” Or was it more like, “We&#x27;re going to put this in people&#x27;s hands and see what they do with it?” Zoë Schiffer: That&#x27;s a good question. I think they saw themselves as “value aligned.” Michael Calore: Yes. That&#x27;s a term that they all use. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. In 2012, there was something called AlexNet that was this convolutional neural network. It was able to identify and classify images in a way that hadn&#x27;t been done before by AI. It blew people&#x27;s minds. You can hear Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talk about how that convinced him to change the company&#x27;s direction towards AI, so a big moment. Then in 2017, there were some Google researchers that worked on this paper. It&#x27;s known as the attention paper now that basically defined the modern day transformers that make up the T in ChatGPT. You&#x27;re right, Mike, there were these groups and companies that were hopping on the train, and OpenAI from the beginning was like, “We definitely want to be on that train, but we think that we&#x27;re more value-aligned than the others.” Michael Calore: Something that they realized very quickly is that if you&#x27;re building artificial intelligence models, you need massive amounts of computing power, and they did not have the money to buy that power. That created a shift. Lauren Goode: They turned to daddy Microsoft. Zoë Schiffer: Well, they try and raise as a nonprofit, and Sam says it&#x27;s just not successful, and so they&#x27;re forced to take on a different model, and the nonprofit starts to morph into this other thing that has a for-profit subsidiary. OpenAI starts to look weird and Frankenstein even in its early years. Lauren Goode: Yeah. By the early 2020s, Sam had left Y Combinator. OpenAI was his full-time thing. They had created this for-profit arm, and then that enabled them to go to Microsoft, daddy Warbucks, and raise, I think, a billion dollars to start. Michael Calore: Then what is Sam&#x27;s own journey during this time? Is he investing? Is he just running this company? Lauren Goode: He&#x27;s meditating. Michael Calore: He&#x27;s very into meditation. Lauren Goode: Just meditating. Zoë Schiffer: In classic founder, venture capitalist kind of fashion, he&#x27;s investing in a bunch of different companies. He&#x27;s poured $375 million into Helion Energy, which is a speculative nuclear fusion company. He&#x27;s put $180 million into Retro Biosciences, which is looking at longevity and how people can live longer. He&#x27;s raised $115 million for WorldCoin, which Lauren, you went to another events recently, right? Lauren Goode: Yeah. WorldCoin is a pretty fascinating company, and I think in some ways is also emblematic of Sam&#x27;s approach, ambition, personality, because what they&#x27;re creating is, well, there&#x27;s an app, but there&#x27;s also an orb. A physical orb like a ball that you&#x27;re supposed to gaze into, and it captures your irises, and then it transforms that into an identity token that puts it on the blockchain. The idea that Sam has expressed is that, “Look, in the not-so-distant future, there&#x27;s going to be so much fakeness out there in the world because of AI, and people are going to be really easily able to spoof your identity thanks to the AI I&#x27;m building. Therefore, I have a solution for you.” His solution is this WorldCoin, now just called World product. Here&#x27;s the man who is accelerating the development of AI and saying, “Here are the potential perils, but also I have the solution, folks.” Zoë Schiffer: I&#x27;m pro anything that lets me not remember my many, many passwords, so you can scan my iris, Sam. Lauren Goode: What else was he investing in? Zoë Schiffer: During this period, he&#x27;s also getting rich. He&#x27;s buying fancy cars. He&#x27;s racing those fancy cars. He gets married. He says he wants to have kids soon. He purchases a $27 million house in San Francisco, and then he&#x27;s pouring a ton of energy into OpenAI and specifically launching ChatGPT, which is going to be the commercial face of what was previously a nonprofit. Lauren Goode: Yeah. That&#x27;s really a watershed moment. It&#x27;s the end of 2022, and all of a sudden people have a user interface. It&#x27;s not just some LLM that people don&#x27;t fully understand or comprehend that&#x27;s working behind the scenes. It&#x27;s something that they can go to on their laptop or on their phone and type in and then have this search experience that feels very conversational and different from the search experience that we&#x27;ve known and understood for the past 20 years. Sam is the face of this. The product events that OpenAI starts hosting intermittently start to feel a little bit like Apple events in the way that people, us, tech journalists are covering it. Then the next year in 2023, before the blip, Sam goes on this world tour. He&#x27;s meeting with prime ministers and heads of state, and what he&#x27;s doing is he&#x27;s calling for a very specific kind of regulatory agency for AI. He has decided that if AI continues to grow in its influence and power, that it&#x27;s going to be regulated at some point potentially, and that he wants to be a part of that conversation. Not just a part of that conversation. He wants to have control over what that framework looks like. Zoë Schiffer: Right. You pointed to this earlier, but there is this ongoing debate about artificial general intelligence and the idea that AI will become sentient at some point and maybe even escape the box and turn against us humans. Sam recently said that this isn&#x27;t actually his top concern, which I think is a little concerning. But he said something smart, I thought, which was that there&#x27;s a lot of harm that can be done without reaching AGI, like misinformation and political misuses of AI. They don&#x27;t really need artificial intelligence to be that intelligent in order to be very, very destructive Michael Calore: Yeah. Job loss. We should also mention AI&#x27;s impact on labor, because a lot of companies are eager to cut costs and they buy into an AI system that automates some of the work they used to rely on humans to do. Those humans lose their jobs. The company realizes that maybe the AI tool that they&#x27;re relying on is not as good as the humans. Maybe it actually does the job better. Zoë Schiffer: We&#x27;re already seeing somewhat. I feel like Duolingo laid off a bunch of their translators and is investing a lot of money in AI right now. Lauren Goode: That&#x27;s a real bummer, because I thought my next career would be a Duolingo translator. Zoë Schiffer: It&#x27;s a bummer, because I&#x27;m looking at the Duolingo owl right behind your head, so we know you&#x27;re in bed with Duolingo. Lauren Goode: There really is one in the studio here. Duolingo sent me some owl heads. I just love Duolingo. Michael Calore: You know who loves Duolingo? Lauren Goode: Who? Who? That was an owl joke, folks. This podcast is over. Oh, I love it so much. Back to Sam Altman. You&#x27;re correct, Zoe. One of the most interesting parts about Sam going around the world talking to politicians and heads of state about how to regulate AI is that there&#x27;s this assumption that it is just one overarching solution for how to regulate it as opposed to seeing what comes up and the different needs we have in different spaces for how the technology is actually going to work. Zoë Schiffer: That&#x27;s one criticism he&#x27;s gotten from people like Mark Andreessen who say he&#x27;s going for regulatory capture. They&#x27;re very suspect of his efforts to be part of the regulatory push of AI, because obviously he&#x27;s invested in seeing that regulation look a certain way. One other thing that he says, which I think is quite interesting and a bit self-serving, is that some of the things that look like they&#x27;re separate, or as tech people like to say, orthogonal to AI safety are actually really closely related to AI safety. When we look at human reinforcement of models, so the idea that you get two different responses to your prompt and you as a human vote on which one was more helpful. That can make the model a lot smarter, a lot faster, but it also can make the model more aligned to our societal values in theory. Michael Calore: That pretty much brings us back to the scene that we outlined at the beginning, the blip when Sam was fired, and then four or five days later got his job back. Well, now that Sam Altman has been back at the helm of OpenAI for about a year, it has been an eventful year, and part of that is because all eyes are on the company. We&#x27;re paying extra close attention to everything that we&#x27;re doing, but it&#x27;s also due to the fact that this company is making a massively impactful piece of technology that touches so many different things in our world. Let&#x27;s very quickly go through what the last year has been like with Sam back at the driver&#x27;s seat. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. It&#x27;s not even, I would say just that all eyes are on the company and that they&#x27;re building these massively impactful products. It&#x27;s also that OpenAI is a messy company. Its executives are constantly leaving. They&#x27;re constantly starting other companies that are even more overtly safety conscious supposedly than OpenAI. Lauren Goode: They have these really funny names, the people who leave. They&#x27;re like, &quot;I&#x27;m starting a new startup. It&#x27;s brand new. It&#x27;s called the anti-OpenAI safety alignment measures OpenAI never took company.&quot; Zoë Schiffer: The super, super, super, super safe non-OpenAI safety company. Just to start with some of the copyright claims, one of the major points of contention with what Sam is building and what AI companies are building is that in order to train a large language model, you need a shit ton of data. A lot of these companies are allegedly scraping that data from the open web. They&#x27;re taking artists&#x27; work without their permission. They&#x27;re scraping YouTube in what might be an illegal fashion. They&#x27;re using all of that to train their models, and they&#x27;re often not crediting the sources. When ChatGPT 4.0 comes out, it has a voice that sounds remarkably like Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s voice in the movie Heart. Scarlett Johansson gets really upset about this, and she almost sues the company. She says that Sam Altman came to her directly and asked her to participate in this project to record her voice and be the voice of Sky, which is the voice of ChatGPT 4.0, and she said no. She thought about it and then she didn&#x27;t feel comfortable doing it. She felt like the company had gone ahead and used her voice without permission. It comes out that that wasn&#x27;t actually the case. It seems like they just hired an actor that sounded remarkably like her, but again, messy. Messy, messy, messy. Michael Calore: All right. Let&#x27;s take another break and we&#x27;ll come right back. Welcome back. On one side, we have all the mess. We have the FTC looking into violations of consumer protection laws. We have lawsuits and deals being signed between media companies and other people who publish copyrighted work. Lauren Goode: Is this where we do the disclaimer? Michael Calore: Oh, yes. Including Conde Nast. Lauren Goode: Including Conde Nast, our parent company. Michael Calore: Our parent company has signed a deal with OpenAI, a licensing deal so that our published work can be used to train its models. There are safety and culture concerns. There&#x27;s the fact that they&#x27;re being fast and loose with celebrity impressions. Then on the other side, we have a company that is making a big important technology that many in the industry are throwing tons of money and tons of deals behind in order to prop it up and make sure that it accelerates as quickly as possible. We&#x27;re in this position as users where we have to ask ourselves, do we trust this company? Do we trust Sam Altman to have our best future in mind when they&#x27;re rolling this stuff out into the world? Lauren Goode: Knowing fair well that this very podcast is going to be used to train some future voice bot in OpenAI. Michael Calore: It&#x27;ll sound like all three of us mixed together. Lauren Goode: Sorry about the vocal fry. Zoë Schiffer: I would listen to that. Lauren Goode: Right now, there&#x27;s this equation that is being made as we use not just ChatGPT, not just going to ChatGPT and typing in a query and training the model that way. Just our data being on the internet is being used to train these models in many instances without anyone&#x27;s consent, and it just feels like this moment. It requires so much intellectual or existential gymnastics of living a life online right now to think about whether what you&#x27;re getting from this tech is actually as great as what you have to put into it, what you are putting into it. I personally have not gotten a lot of benefit from using apps like ChatGPT or Gemini or others. That could change. It could absolutely change. There are a lot of instances of AI that I use in my day-to-day life right now, embedded in my email application and my phone and all this stuff that actually are really great, have absolutely benefited me. These new models of generative AI tools, it&#x27;s still a giant TBD, and yet I know that I&#x27;ve already given more to these machines. Is Sam Altman the singular person who I look to and I&#x27;m like, &quot;I trust this guy with that, with figuring out that equation for me?&quot; No. Michael Calore: No. What about you, Zoe? Zoë Schiffer: I would say no, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s proven himself to be particularly trustworthy. If the people who work closely with him are leaving and starting their own things that they say will be more trustworthy, then I think that speaks to something we should be somewhat concerned about. At the same time, I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any single person that I would trust with this. It&#x27;s a lot of power and a lot of responsibility to have in one fallible human being. Lauren Goode: Yet I definitely have met and reported on tech entrepreneurs who I think have a pretty straight moral compass, who are being very thoughtful about what they build, who have been thoughtful about what they build. I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, tech bro bad.&quot; He&#x27;s definitely not the guy. He may emerge as that person, but at this moment right now, no. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. I will say that he does seem very thoughtful. He doesn&#x27;t seem like an Elon Musk in the way that he&#x27;s just making impulsive decisions. He seems to really think through things and take the power and responsibility that he has pretty seriously. Lauren Goode: He did manage to raise $6.6 billion from investors just a month or so ago, so there are clearly a lot of people in the industry who do have a certain level of faith in him. It doesn&#x27;t mean they have faith that he&#x27;s going to handle all this data in the best way possible, but it certainly means they have faith that he&#x27;s going to make a lot of money through ChatGPT. Zoë Schiffer: Or they&#x27;re just really concerned about missing out. Lauren Goode: They have a lot of FOMO. They&#x27;re looking at the subscription numbers for ChatGPT, but they&#x27;re also seeing a lot of potential for growth in the enterprise business, the way that ChatGPT will license its API or work with other businesses so that those businesses can create all these different plugins in their day-to-day applications and make their workers more productive and stuff. There&#x27;s a lot of potential there, and I think that&#x27;s what investors are looking at right now. Michael Calore: This is normally the point in the podcast where, as the third person in the room, I provide a balanced perspective by taking a different tack than the two of you. But I&#x27;m going to throw that out the window because I also do not think that we should be trusting Sam Altman or OpenAI with open arms. Now, there are things that the company is doing that I think are very good, like the idea of a productivity tool or a suite of productivity tools that can help people do their jobs better. It can help you study. It can help you understand complex concepts. It can help you shop for things online. Those are all interesting. I&#x27;m particularly very curious to see what they do with search when their search tool becomes more mature, and we can really see whether or not it&#x27;s a challenge to this paradigm for search that has existed for almost 20 years at this point. Capital G. Google. Beyond that, I don&#x27;t think that their tools are going to have an impact on society that is going to be a net positive. I think there is going to be enough strife in the job loss and in the theft of copyrighted work and in energy use and water use that are required to run all these complex models on the cloud computing data centers. Then of course, misinformation and deep fakes, which now are pretty easy to spot and are getting harder to spot, and within a couple of years will become indistinguishable from actual footage and actual news. I feel like as human beings on the internet, we are going to bear the brunt of these bad things that are coming. To your point, Lauren, as journalists, we are going to be collateral damage in this race to see who can create the model that does our jobs for us the best, and OpenAI is the leader there. This pursuit of profit without really looking at those problems head on sounds dangerous to me. We talked about earlier in the episode, Sam Altman has said that he encourages open debate and he encourages us as a society to decide what the boundaries of this technology should be. But I think that we&#x27;re moving way too quickly and the debate is happening way too slowly. That feels like an avoidant stance to say, &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t worry. We&#x27;re going to figure it out as a collective.&quot; While at the same time you&#x27;re pressing on the accelerator pedal as hard as you can to go as fast as possible and spend as much money as possible. Those things feel out of sync. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. He speaks very generally when he talks about how everyone should have a voice in these decisions regarding how AI is built and how it&#x27;s governed. One thing when you mentioned job loss that it made me think of, and we&#x27;ve mentioned this on a previous podcast episode, is that Sam Altman is involved in universal basic income experiments. The idea that you give people a fixed amount of money every month, and hopefully that mitigates any job loss that&#x27;s involved in your other projects. Lauren Goode: I think that we&#x27;re in this moment generally, technology and society, where we may be forced to let go of some of the institutions that we&#x27;ve relied on for the past few decades. Technologists are often the first people to jump on that and say, &quot;We have a better idea. We have a better solution. We have a better idea for government. We have a better idea for how people should get paid and make money. We have a better idea for how you should be doing your work and what can make you more productive. We have all these ideas.&quot; They&#x27;re not always bad ideas, and at some point we do have to let go. Change happens. It&#x27;s inevitable. What is it? It&#x27;s not death and taxes. It&#x27;s change and taxes. That&#x27;s the inevitable. Also, death. Zoë Schiffer: Lauren is part of the DOGE commission and she&#x27;s coming for your institution. Lauren Goode: Yes. But then you have to also identify the right people to affect that change. That is, I think, the question that we&#x27;re asking. We&#x27;re not asking are these bad ideas? We&#x27;re asking who is Sam Altman? Is this the person who should be steering this change, and if not him, then who? Zoë Schiffer: But Lauren, just to push back on that, he is the person. At a certain point, we&#x27;re living in a fantasy if we three tech journalists are just sitting here talking about, should it be Sam? Should it not be? Well, he&#x27;s doing it and it doesn&#x27;t look like he&#x27;s going away anytime soon, because the board was not in a real sense able to push him out despite the fact that it legally had that right. He&#x27;s still CEO. Lauren Goode: Yeah. He&#x27;s entrenched at this point, and the company is entrenched simply just based on how much money is invested in them. There are a lot of stakeholders who absolutely are going to make sure that this company succeeds, no doubt. But also, if we&#x27;re at the early-ish phase of generative AI in the way that other transformative technologies have had their early-ish stages, and then sometimes there are other people in companies that emerge that actually end up doing more. Michael Calore: What we&#x27;re hoping for is corrective forces. Lauren Goode: Maybe. We&#x27;ll see. Zoë Schiffer: Okay. I stand corrected then. I feel like maybe it is worth having this discussion on who should lead it. We&#x27;re early days still, I feel like. I lose sight of that sometimes. Lauren Goode: That&#x27;s okay. You may be right. Zoë Schiffer: Because it feels like he&#x27;s the dominant player. Michael Calore: That&#x27;s the best part about reporting on technology is that we&#x27;re always in the early days of something, Lauren Goode: I suppose so. Michael Calore: All right. Well, that feels like as good of a place as any to end it. We&#x27;ve solved it. We should not trust Sam Altman, but we should trust the AI industry to self-correct. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. I think of this quote that Sam wrote on his blog many, many years ago, and he said, &quot;A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time, and most people don&#x27;t even try. They just accept the way things as they are.&quot; I feel like that says a lot about him. It also makes me think, Lauren, to your point, that I&#x27;ve accepted, well, Sam Altman is just in charge, and that&#x27;s just the reality. Well, maybe the world needs to bend things a little to our will in a democratic fashion, not let him just lead the new future. Lauren Goode: Never succumb to inevitability. Michael Calore: Now, that really is a good place to end it. That&#x27;s our show for today. We&#x27;ll be back next week with an episode about whether or not it&#x27;s time to get off social media.

The Network State is a plan for techno-utopians to abandon antiquated nation states and build geographically distributed technocratic sovereignties. At a time when the political debate is between those invested in current institutions and those who want to build anew, the Network State has gone viral as the leading exit strategy. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement This is due in large part to Balaji himself, who has used his prominence and elite connections to spread the Network State meme, including with the Network State Podcast and by launching the Network School this year. His critics (primarily from the left) have accused the Network State of engaging in fascist-chic cosplay and establishing a libertarian enclave that entrenches an outdated Westphalian-style sovereignty based on territorial boundedness and diplomatic recognition that does not serve digital nations. Suffice it to say, none of those critiques, counter-movements nor, for that matter, the recent election of a reform-minded technocracy to the White House, has sapped any energy from the Network State meme. There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. This profile is part of CoinDesk&#39;s Most Influential 2024 package. For all of this year&#39;s nominees, click here .

(AP) — Far-right influencer Nick Fuentes is due in court later this month after a woman accused him of pepper-spraying her when she showed up at his suburban Chicago home following his “Your body, my choice” post on X. According to court documents, the 57-year-old woman approached Fuentes’ home in Berwyn on Nov. 10, shortly after his address was leaked following his post, the Chicago Tribune reported. Berwyn is a Chicago suburb of about 54,000 people. The woman told the newspaper in a Nov. 15 interview that her friends encouraged her to go to Fuentes’ home to see if rumors were true that he had been receiving prank deliveries after his post on X. She said she made a video of herself on the sidewalk in front of Fuentes’ home. Another woman pulled up in her car and told her to ring the doorbell. She alleged that Fuentes opened the door before she could ring the bell, pepper-sprayed her, screamed an expletive and took her phone. Fuentes, 26, faces a battery charge in connection with the incident, the newspaper reported. He is due to appear in court on Dec. 19. He has posted mugshots of himself on his X account along with “Free me (racial slur).” He didn’t immediately respond to a message The Associated Press sent him Saturday through X.

Fuentes, a Holocaust-denying white supremacist, is part of an emboldened fringe of right-wing “manosphere” influencers who have seized on Republican Donald Trump’s presidential victory to amplify misogynistic derision and threats online. Many of them have appropriated the “my body, my choice” abortion rights slogan, changing it to “your body, my choice.” The twist on the wording has been largely attributed to Fuentes’ Nov. 5 X post: “Your body, my choice.

Photograph: Nicole Hester/AP Far right (US) This article is more than 9 months old White supremacist Nick Fuentes charged over Chicago pepper-spray incident This article is more than 9 months old Far-right influencer allegedly attacked woman outside his house after he tweeted misogynistic statement Ramon Antonio Vargas Sat 7 Dec 2024 10.53 EST Last modified on Sat 7 Dec 2024 13.59 EST Share The notorious white supremacist Nick Fuentes is facing battery charges in Illinois because authorities say he pepper-sprayed a woman who had knocked on his front door after he enraged many on the internet by tweeting the misogynistic slogan “ your body, my choice ” following Donald Trump’s victory in the recent presidential election. Fuentes, 26, was arrested on 27 November on a count of misdemeanor battery and released the same day, according to documents filed on Wednesday in the Cook county circuit court that were reported on by the Chicago Sun-Times . He is tentatively scheduled to appear in court on 19 December. The far-right, avowedly antisemitic influencer seemingly sought to make light of his legal predicament on Friday on social media, publishing a post on X that contained a thinly disguised racial slur as well as the words “Free me”. Trump Pentagon pick Pete Hegseth’s books foreground anti-Muslim rhetoric Read more Meanwhile, the Jewish feminist activist pressing the case against Fuentes, 57-year-old Marla Rose, also commented on social media, writing on Facebook: “It. Is. On.” She added “civil case pending” to the post that displayed three fire emojis. Fuentes invited the digital sphere’s fury by celebrating Trump’s return to the presidency at the expense of Kamala Harris on 6 November with a barb tweeted on X reading: “Your body, my choice. Forever.” The post taunting the concept of women’s bodily autonomy – along with the 2022 elimination of federal abortion rights at the hands of a US supreme court dominated by judges either appointed by or aligned with Trump – had gained more than 99.7m views as of Saturday. And some of Fuentes’s political opponents retaliated by publishing his home address on social media while declaring: “Your house, our choice.” Rose ultimately told police that she had gone to record the outside of Fuentes’s home in the Chicago-area suburb of Berwyn on 10 November. He soon allegedly pepper-sprayed her, pushed her on to the concrete and broke her cellphone. Video of the encounter that Rose later released showed Fuentes open his front door as she reached up to ring the doorbell. He extended his left arm while holding a bottle of pepper spray, which prompted Rose to say: “Oh my God, what are you doing?” The phone was then seen falling while Fuentes could be heard saying: “Get the fuck out of here.” Fuentes then seemingly used his foot to drag the phone inside his house before closing the door and locking it. A police report filed on 11 November said another woman driving by Fuentes’s house at the time called officers. That witness described seeing a man shove a woman outside a home, the report recounted. Rose was still at the scene when police arrived, and officers reportedly spoke with her as well as Fuentes separately. The report added that Fuentes claimed to police that he had received death threats as well as “people showing up to his house unannounced” after posting “a political joke online” had left him “in fear for his life”. He eventually “became uncooperative” and refused to further address the confrontation with Rose, as NBC News reported . Rose had “watery” eyes but listed no other visible physical injuries, the report said. Possible punishments for misdemeanor battery under Illinois law include relatively short jail sentences, probation and fines. Some of the earliest news media headlines given to Fuentes came when he withdrew from Boston University after participating in the 2017 white supremacist rally objecting to the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia. A demonstrator protesting the white supremacists was murdered by a neo-Nazi sympathizer who intentionally drove a car into her as well as others. Trump then ignited a scandal by hosting Fuentes as a dinner guest at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022 as he geared up to run for a second presidency. Another guest at that dinner was the rapper previously known as Kanye West, who had propagated antisemitic remarks that – among other consequences – cost him a business partnership with the sportswear company Adidas.

The cofounder of venture capital firm a16z, also known as Andreessen Horowitz, said social isolation remains a common penalty for those who think differently about certain left-leaning circles in the tech mecca. Andreessen said this year the same fissures that have split the country have caused a rupture in the once-monolithic Democratic stronghold , as nearly every demographic group abandoned the party to varying degrees. “We’re going through the first profound political realignment probably since the 1960s,” Andreessen said in an interview with Joe Rogan posted on Tuesday, arguing the Republicans were now the party of common sense, no war, and the working class. Fearing he’d be written off as a “crazy right-winger” for daring to celebrate that it was “morning in America” now that Trump had won the election, the cocreator of the world’s first mainstream internet browser said he—like many other constituencies that traditionally supported the Democrats—actually defected from the party. “I was a Democrat in good standing,” he said, having backed Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, and Barack Obama previously. He even recounted the shock and sadness he felt over dinner with other Silicon Valley friends immediately following Trump’s first victory. They had all voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016—Andreessen himself included. Despite that long-standing voting record, his decision to now back Trump over Kamala Harris in this year’s race has resulted in doors being figuratively slammed in his face. “This is actually true: There’s now two kinds of dinner parties in Silicon Valley—they fractured cleanly in half,” Andreessen told Rogan in a three-hour-long podcast interview. On the one hand, there are gatherings he can still attend where he might run into other first-time Trump supporters such as Elon Musk. But his presence is no longer welcome among what he labeled the “coastal elites.” “There’s the ones where every person there believes every single thing that was in the New York Times that day … and that is what they talk about at the dinner party,” Andreessen claimed. “And I’m no longer invited to those, nor do I want to go to them.” ‘Lockstep conformity’ Andreessen’s abandonment of the Democratic Party primarily—but not exclusively—stemmed from what he called the Biden administration’s attempt to kill his business through the regulation of crypto, where a16z is the largest venture capital firm. Story Continues Rather than the state ensuring a level playing field so that it could focus on calling balls and strikes, he claimed federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), all sought to control the outcomes outright in various ways. He alleges that the goal was to ensure that only a small number of large companies would survive, and all agreed to be completely regulated and controlled by the government. “We had meetings this spring that were the most alarming meetings where [regulators] were taking us through their plans: Basically just full government control,” he claimed . “They told us, ‘Just don’t even start startups, don’t even bother, there’s no way they can succeed, there’s no way we’re going to permit that to happen.’” One tactic he claimed he personally witnessed was the federal government’s attempt to coerce his business partners and even his own partner’s father, author and fellow Trump supporter&nbsp; David Horowitz , by pressuring banks to revoke their access to the financial system entirely. Andreessen said the party no longer tolerated dissent within its ranks and instead demanded lockstep conformity enforced through cancel culture, effectively reducing the Democrats to a religious cult minus the opportunity for redemption. “You might call [it] ‘soft totalitarianism,’ which is just rules and power exercised arbitrarily that just simply suppresses everything,” he continued, citing de-banking as just one example. If the Democrats ever want to pull themselves out of the mess they are in, Andreessen advised them to promote prominent far-left critics like New York Congressman Ritchie Torres to positions of leadership.

Photograph: Davidmerfield Far right (US) This article is more than 1 month old Profile He’s anti-democracy and pro-Trump: the obscure ‘dark enlightenment’ blogger influencing the next US administration This article is more than 1 month old Key figures in the incoming administration follow Curtis Yarvin, who’s pushing for an autocratic takeover of the US Jason Wilson Sat 21 Dec 2024 07.00 EST Last modified on Sat 21 Dec 2024 07.02 EST Share Curtis Yarvin is hardly a household name in US politics. But the “neoreactionary” thinker and far-right blogger is emerging as a serious intellectual influence on key figures in Donald Trump’s coming administration in particular over potential threats to US democracy. Yarvin, who considers liberal democracy as a decadent enemy to be dismantled, is intellectually influential on vice president-elect JD Vance and close to several proposed Trump appointees. The aftermath of Trump’s election victory has seen actions and rhetoric from Trump and his lieutenants that closely resemble Yarvin’s public proposals for taking autocratic power in America. Trump’s legal moves against critics in the media, Elon Musk ’s promises to pare government spending to the bone, and the deployment of the Maga base against Republican lawmakers who have criticized controversial nominees like Pete Hegseth are among the measures that resemble elements of Yarvin’s strategy for displacing liberal democracy in the US. ‘Mama bears are rising up’: the rightwing Christian entrepreneur aiming for a takeover of local US government Read more One of the venues in which Yarvin has articulated the strategy include a podcast hosted by Michael Anton, a writer and academic whom Trump last week appointed to work in a senior role under secretary of state nominee Marco Rubio . Although Yarvin once described Vance as a “random normie politician I’ve barely even met” in a July Substack post, in October the Verge reported that “no one online has shaped Vance’s thinking more”. The growing parallels between the incoming administration’s actions – especially Vance’s views – and Yarvin’s suggestions raise questions about his influence. Robert Evans, an extremism researcher and the host of the podcast Behind the Bastards, recorded a two-part series on Yarvin. “He didn’t fall out of a coconut tree. He emerged into a rightwing media space where they had been talking about the evils of liberal media and corrupt academic institutions for decades,” he said. “He has influenced a lot of people in the incoming administration and a lot of other influential people on the right. But a lot of the stuff he advocates is the same windmills Republicans have been tilting at for a while,” Evans continued. “What’s unique is his way of rebranding or repackaging old reactionary ideas in a way that appealed to libertarian-minded kids in the tech industry, and in eventually getting some of them to embrace a lot of far-right ideas,” he said. “That’s the novelty of Yarvin and that’s his real accomplishment.” ‘A form of one-man rule’ Anton and Yarvin’s May 2021 conversation was recorded for the podcast of the American Mind, a publication of the powerful rightwing Claremont Institute, where Anton is a senior fellow, and whose growing influence during the Trump era has seen it described as the “ nerve center of the American right”. On 8 December, Trump’s transition team announced that Anton would be appointed director of policy planning at the state department. Anton also served in a communications role in Trump’s first-term national security council from February 2017 until April 2018, resigning the day before neoconservative John Bolton assumed the role of national security adviser. After leaving the first Trump administration , Anton did not abandon Trump, but continued writing about US liberal democracy in bleak terms. In Up from Conservatism, a 2023 anthology of essays edited by the executive director of Claremont’s Center for the American Way of Life, Arthur Milikh, Anton wrote that “the United States peaked around 1965”, and that Americans are ruled by “a network of unelected bureaucrats … corporate-tech-finance senior management, ‘experts’ who set the boundaries of acceptable opinion, and media figures who police those boundaries”. Anton continued the discussion in sections headed “The universities have become evil”, “Our economy is fake”, “The people are corrupt”, “Our civilization has lost the will to live”. His and Yarvin’s conversation was ostensibly about his 2020 book, The Stakes. That book was controversial even on the right for its prolonged consideration of autocratic “Caesarism” as a means of resolving American decadence. In the book, he defined Caesarism as a “form of one-man rule: halfway … between monarchy and tyranny”. He adds, though, that “Caesarism is not tyranny, which, strictly understood, is a regime that usurps a legitimate and functioning government”, whereas Caesarism implements “authoritarian one-man rule partially legitimized by necessity” – that is, “the breakdown of republican, constitutional rule”, adding that “a nation no longer capable of ruling itself must yet be ruled”. He writes that a “Red Caesar” could be attractive to “the reds” in the Republican coalition, who he says are “under constant rhetorical, political, and, increasingly, physical attack, especially in blue states”, making them “more likely to turn to a Caesar”. Anton stops short of openly calling for authoritarian rule, but in general, he writes that the advantages of Caesarism include “continuity and stability” and “the prospect of avoiding conflict”, and that it “tends to engender calm”. ‘This is what we’re going to do’ Yarvin is the originator of the neoreactionary or “dark enlightenment” movement, whose early ideas he developed on a blog called Unqualified Reservations in 2007 and 2008 under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug. He now writes a Substack newsletter under his own name and the far-right imprint Passage Publishing recently published an anthology of his earlier writing. The Guardian previously reported that Passage Publishing’s founder is Jonathan Keeperman, a former UC Irvine lecturer who had previously operated under the pseudonym “L0m3z”. US founder of neo-Nazi network sentenced to two years of time served Read more For years, Yarvin has consistently held to a number of explicitly anti-democratic beliefs: republican self-government has already ended; real power is exercised oligarchically in a small number of prestigious academic and media institutions he calls the Cathedral; and a sclerotic democracy should be replaced by a strict hierarchy headed by a single person whose role is that of a monarch or CEO. He also thinks that current liberal democracy contains the seeds of its own destruction. As JD Vance put it in a 2021 podcast interview with far-right influencer Jack Murphy: “There’s this guy Curtis Yarvin who’s written about some of these things. One has to basically accept that the whole thing is going to fall in on itself.” Vance added: “The task of conservatives right now is to preserve as much as can be preserved and then when the inevitable collapse comes you build back the country in a way that’s actually better.” View image in fullscreen Vice-president-elect JD Vance has spoken approvingly about some of Yarvin’s prescriptions for political action. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP In 2022 Vox called Yarvin the “person who’s spent the most time gaming out how, exactly, the US government could be toppled and replaced”. Yarvin suggests that a would-be American autocrat should campaign on and win an electoral mandate for an authoritarian program. They should purge the federal bureaucracy in a push Yarvin has anagrammatized as Rage (for “retire all government employees”). They should simply ignore any court rulings that seek to constrain them. They should bring Congress to heel, in part by mobilizing their populist base against recalcitrant lawmakers. And liberal or mainstream media organizations and universities should be summarily closed. Given the post-election period and Trump’s preparation for a return to the White House, Yarvin’s program seems less fanciful then it did in 2021, when he laid it out for Anton. In the recording of that podcast, Yarvin offers a condensed presentation of his program which he has laid out on Substack and in other venues. Midway through their conversation, Anton says to Yarvin, “You’re essentially advocating for someone to – age-old move – gain power lawfully through an election, and then exercise it unlawfully”, adding: “What do you think the actual chances of that happening are?” Yarvin responded: “It wouldn’t be unlawful,” adding: “You’d simply declare a state of emergency in your inaugural address.” Yarvin continued: “You’d actually have a mandate to do this. Where would that mandate come from? It would come from basically running on it, saying, ‘Hey, this is what we’re going to do.’” Throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump promised to carry out a wide array of anti-democratic or authoritarian moves, and effectively ran on these promises. Trump has suggested he might declare a state of emergency in response to America’s immigration crisis. Trump also promised to pursue retribution on individually named antagonists like representative Nancy Pelosi and senator-elect Adam Schiff, and spoke more broadly about dispatching the US military to deal with “ the enemy within ”. Later in the recording, Yarvin said that after a hypothetical authoritarian president was inaugurated in January, “you can’t continue to have a Harvard or a New York Times past since perhaps the start of April”. Later expanding on the idea with “the idea that you’re going to be a Caesar and take power and operate with someone else’s Department of Reality in operation is just manifestly absurd.” “Machiavelli could tell you right away that that’s a stupid idea,” Yarvin added. While he has not yet assumed power, Trump has moved against media outlets, commencing lawsuits against some including the Des Moines Register, CBS and ABC, with the latter settling a $15m suit that legal experts believed to be winnable for the broadcaster. Vice-president-elect JD Vance, meanwhile, and others in the broader Maga orbit like Christopher Rufo have identified universities as primary ideological enemies, with Rufo helping to remake New College of Florida in the image of Christian nationalism. In 2022, Vance told Vanity Fair : “I tend to think that we should seize the institutions of the left and turn them against the left. We need like a de-Baathification program, a de-woke-ification program.” The Guardian reported in August that Vance said in a podcast recording: “There is no way for a conservative to accomplish our vision of society unless we’re willing to strike at the heart of the beast. That’s the universities.” Elsewhere in the podcast with Anton, Yarvin talked of the need to mobilise the base of the party – its ordinary supporters – in the service of the cause. Yarvin postulated this could be done with an app that supporters would download and take instructions from when opponents were identified. Yarvin said the notional US autocrat would use the app “to re-create the Sons of Liberty style, quote-unquote, protest”, he said. The Sons of Liberty is a name for underground cadres who pushed back on British rule in the lead-up to the American Revolution; one historian wrote that their methods amounted to “mob terror”. Although no Trump app exists that parallels the one Yarvin postulates, the pro-Trump social media apparatus has already directed the Maga base’s ire against Republican lawmaker Joni Ernst, a self-identified sexual assault survivor who expressed scepticism about the nomination of Pete Hegseth, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. In a story on Ernst’s backdown earlier this month, the New York Times reported that “her shift suggested that Mr. Trump’s MAGA base was ready, willing and able to bully Republicans into submitting to his desires”. Yarvin’s recommendations for a president in power were for the sharp and sudden concentration of police powers. “Essentially, you have to be willing to say, OK, when we have this regime change, we have a period of temporary uncertainty which has to be resolved in an extremely peaceful way. What that means is basically a state of emergency in the White House,” he said. “It means the president is basically taking direct control over all law enforcement authorities, a state of emergency in basically every state,” he added. In September, on the campaign trail, Trump said that “one real rough, nasty” and “violent day” of unrestrained policing would end crime “immediately.” “One rough hour – and I mean real rough – the word will get out and it will end immediately, you know? It will end immediately,” Trump added.

But beyond his reputation as an innovator lies a deeper, more consequential agenda: reshaping governance itself. His anti-democratic beliefs, investments in public-private partnerships, and growing influence on the political landscape through allies like J.D. Vance, align strikingly with the goals of Project 2025 — a comprehensive conservative plan to overhaul the federal government. Together, they represent a roadmap toward a technocratic future that consolidates power in the hands of elites. The Foundations of Thiel’s Vision Thiel has never shied away from controversy. In a 2009 essay, he openly questioned the compatibility of democracy and freedom, advocating for a system where power is concentrated among those with the expertise to drive progress. His investments in data analytics firm Palantir, artificial intelligence, and alternative media platforms demonstrate a calculated strategy to embed private-sector influence in public systems. For Thiel, innovation isn’t just about creating better products — it’s about controlling the infrastructure of progress.

Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters By Kate Conger Dec. 24, 2024 The artificial intelligence company founded by Elon Musk, xAI, said on Monday that it had raised $6 billion, giving the start-up a major lift as it competes with rivals, including OpenAI. The company said on its website that it would use the money to continue building its infrastructure and accelerate research and development. BlackRock, Fidelity, Sequoia Capital and others participated in the funding round. “A lot of compute is needed,” Mr. Musk said of the investment round in a post on X. The fund-raising could value xAI at $35 billion to $40 billion , up from $24 billion earlier this year, The New York Times previously reported. Mr. Musk and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Musk is trying to play catch up on A.I. The billionaire, who also leads other companies, including Tesla, X and SpaceX, publicly debuted xAI last year, well after a boom in the A.I. industry spawned dozens of products that could create text, images and even videos. Mr. Musk quickly built what he said would be the world’s largest supercomputer in Memphis, which powers Grok, xAI’s chatbot. Grok is available to subscribers on X. Mr. Musk helped found OpenAI, but walked away from it in 2018 after disagreements with other co-founders, including Sam Altman, its chief executive. Mr. Musk has sued OpenAI to block it from transforming itself from a nonprofit into a for-profit company, saying that Mr. Altman and another co-founder, Greg Brockman, had breached the company’s founding contract by putting commercial interests before the public good. OpenAI has argued that the lawsuit is an attempt to hamstring the company while Mr. Musk builds a rival. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI and Microsoft have denied those claims.) Mr. Musk has argued that A.I. could destroy humanity, but that he has the ability to build it more safely. To jump-start xAI, Mr. Musk has trained its A.I. on data from X. Several investors in Mr. Musk’s bid to acquire X in 2022 have also provided funding for the A.I. start-up, including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the Saudi Arabian prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s investment company, Kingdom Holding. In total, xAI has raised more than $12 billion. Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco. She can be reached at kate.conger@nytimes.com.

China and crypto: What do they have in common? No political movement — be it socialist or nationalist — managed to shape a proper framework to deal with the internet since all their ideas emerged in a different tech context. Silicon Valley legend Balaji Srinivasan opines that modern ideologies are getting ""online"" wrong since they emerged when there was land, but no cloud. The Internet is a globally integrated market, and everyone really is in competition (and collaboration!) with everyone else.

Ripple CEO Reacts to SEC Acknowledging XRP ETF Proposal SEC Just Sent ‘Enormous Message’ About XRP — Balaji (@balajis) December 30, 2024 Meanwhile, the internet already established more powerful social connections than ideologies and even nation-states. Digital social networks represent more influential designs of human interaction compared to those limited by state borders. Advertisement As such, only China and cryptocurrency represent textbook examples of the right perception of the internet's impact and opportunities: There are, however, two factions who take the Internet seriously: China and Crypto. Because they have the Great Firewall and the Blockchain respectively. These are very different types of fortifications that both treat the digital realm as something to be defended, walled off, and protected. The two represent different approaches to leverage this knowledge. China, with its Firewall, targets vertical integration of digital society by making its citizens use only Chinese apps and restricting access to global websites. By contrast, the cryptocurrency segment addresses making software so secure that it can run in the open, on every computer in the world. As such, for Balaji Srinivasan, China represents nationalist socialism, while crypto represents international capitalism. Blockchain grows faster than internet, data shows As covered by U.Today previously, Srinivasan claimed that both Bitcoin (BTC) and AI have already entered vertical phases of their adoption curves. To illustrate this take, he shared the charts of performance results of OpenAI's large language models and the net AUM of ETFs on Spot Bitcoin in the U.S. Related Sat, 12/21/2024 - 12:23 Balaji Srinivasan on Bitcoin, AI: 'Going Vertical' Vladislav Sopov Commenting on his post, former Phunware CEO Alan Knitowski also noticed that Bitcoin (BTC) might be growing faster than the internet in terms of massive adoption trajectory.

Hanlon / January 13, 2025 Alternate Reality Peter Thiel’s Twisted Vision for the Trump Presidency The tech billionaire believes Trump will help to reveal hidden truths—like how Jeffrey Epstein actually died. But beneath his conspiracism lies a very real, very dangerous political theory. Nordin Catic/Getty Images for The Cambridge Union Peter Thiel speaks at the Cambridge Union at Cambridge University on May 8, 2024. Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and prominent supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, is also something of a political theorist. His latest work is an essay in the Financial Times titled “A time for truth and reconciliation,” a nod to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission. You might wonder which injustices of contemporary America are, for Thiel, analogous to apartheid. The disproportionate imprisonment of Black Americans? The impoverishment of Native Americans? Crippling medical debt? Rising homelessness? No. In fact, Thiel isn’t quite sure what injustices require redress—but he’s sure we’re about to find out. “Trump’s return to the White House augurs the apokálypsis of the ancien regime’s secrets,” he writes. The hidden truths that he would have us seek are answers to questions such as: Did financier and child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein really die by suicide? What really happened in the assassination of John F. Kennedy? Did Anthony Fauci “suspect that Covid spawned from US taxpayer-funded research, or an adjacent Chinese military program?” As Thiel sees it, the second Trump administration promises “the most peaceful means of resolving the old guard’s war on the internet, a war the internet won.” Civic institutions—“the media organizations, bureaucracies, universities and government-funded NGOs”—have lost the power to police the truth, and now here comes Trump, who, with “piecemeal declassifications,” can answer all of our questions about who really killed Epstein and JFK. Critics of Thiel’s column call it “ beyond nuts ,” like an “edited version of one of those lunatic emails journalists get sometimes with like 8 different fonts in 9 different colors,” a piece “that perfectly replicates the experience of being cornered by a sweaty cokehead at an Austin, Texas house party.” Those are funny lines, but I think it’s a mistake to dismiss Thiel so easily. Beneath his conspiracism lies a substantive political theory: the wrongheaded belief that absolute freedom of information through a wholly deregulated internet can move us beyond the impasse of dead-end liberal democracy. Thiel’s column, in which he bemoans that “identity politics endlessly relitigates ancient history,” picks up a number of ideas expressed in his 2007 essay “The Straussian Moment,” which argues that rational liberal modernity is stultifying and doomed. “There can be no real accommodation with the Enlightenment,” he writes, “since many of its easy bromides have become deadly falsehoods in our time.” In particular, he refers to the Enlightenment tendency to ignore questions of human nature, the answers to which reveal our endless capacity for violence. Thiel views “America’s constitutional machinery” as a barrier to “a direct path forward” from the weakened and confused state of Enlightenment liberalism in the twenty-first century. The violence that concerns Thiel is what his intellectual mentor, the late Stanford political theorist René Girard, called mimetic violence, in which we imitatively desire what others desire, generating mimetic rivalries that, as Thiel puts it, can “escalate into unlimited violence.” In more concrete terms, Thiel finds the ordinary agonism of American politics both dangerous and duplicitous. In a 2019 interview , he said, “I would like to live in a world that’s less political, where there’s less politics, but I’d also like us to be honest about how terrible politics is … it’s not a nice thing.” Like his recent essay, “The Straussian Moment” also imagined a great unveiling of truth: “One must never forget that one day all will be revealed, that all injustices will be exposed, and all those who perpetuated them will be held to account.” The question we should ask this very wealthy, very influential person who would vest more credibility in people on the internet just asking questions about Covid-19 than he would in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Johns Hopkins Department of Epidemiology is: What then? What would a combination of “less politics,” an even more unfettered internet, and a weakening of media organizations, universities, and government agencies look like? Universities, media organizations, bureaucracies, and nongovernmental organizations all serve as information guardrails. Those civic institutions, it’s fair to say, have lately failed to sustain popular trust, but it’s hard to imagine how a Trump government commission on, say, whether Covid-19 was an “inside job” would help to restore that trust. If post-9/11 was for Thiel a “Straussian moment,” now is a postmodern moment, the time to strike a definitive blow against Enlightenment liberalism and the institutions that reproduce its norms, including American democracy itself. But Thiel’s vision of a “liberation” from the so-called “Distributed Idea Suppression Complex” would mean not a more democratized and direct access to truth but, more likely, a hyper-mediated idea of “truth” that takes on the character of conspiracy theory. Thiel has lamented that “in the last 40 or 50 years there’s been a shift from exteriority … doing things in the real world … to the interior world.” I think we’ve already seen enough, from the “ intellectual dark web ” careening toward conspiracism to the supercharging of misinformation on Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook, to understand that even more of this would not mean “less politics” or “more truth,” but rather a dizzying information landscape in which any one packet of information is as good as the next and everything is politics. Even as a professor—a part of the pernicious ancien régime, as Thiel likely would have it—I’m sympathetic to popular discontent with civic institutions, universities included. The credibility collapse of knowledge-preserving and knowledge-generating institutions is partly of our own making. I have my own frustrations with what often feels like a lack of curiosity-driven academic research. But I also think the alternative that Thiel proposes would only backfire on the principles Thiel himself has stated, particularly amid our obsession over AI. “The mania we have around artificial intelligence,” Thiel said in 2019, “is because it stands for the proposition that humans aren’t supposed to think. We want machines to do the thinking, but it’s because we’re in a world where individuals are not supposed to have intellectual agency of any sort anymore.… We can maybe believe in the wisdom of crowds, we can believe in big data, we can believe in some sort of mechanistic process, but we don’t believe in the mind.” I can see how Thiel can get from his counter-Enlightenment position in “The Straussian Moment” to this reflection on AI to his “truth and reconciliation” essay. Liberating the internet theoretically could give us something like the Kantian counter-Enlightenment of “man’s emergence from his self-imposed nonage,” a call to trust oneself and one’s intellect over corrupt institutions—the “freedom to make public use of one’s reason in all matters.” But I’m skeptical it would play out this way in practice. Rather than a greater belief in the mind and awareness of truth, we’d get faith in an inescapable deluge of meaningless information. Aaron R. Hanlon Aaron R.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Just two years ago, Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation lawsuit against Fox News showed that many right-wing influencers didn’t believe a word of the stuff they were peddling to their audiences. In text messages that surfaced during litigation, top Fox anchors and executives poured scorn on the idea that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen, even as the network amplified that conspiracy theory to its audience. “Our viewers are good people and they believe it,” Tucker Carlson wrote in one message. Today, though, some of the country’s most mainstream, most influential conservatives are stoking paranoid conspiracism—and seem to genuinely believe what they’re saying. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel, for example, could not be more of an establishment figure: He was an early investor in Facebook, is now a mentor of Vice President–Elect J. D. Vance, and has strong links to the U.S. defense industry through his company Palantir. But in a recent opinion column in the ultra-establishment Financial Times , Thiel sounds like The X-Files ’ Fox Mulder after a long night in the Bigfoot forums. “The future demands fresh and strange ideas,” he writes. Read: Peter Thiel is taking a break from democracy After Donald Trump’s second inauguration, Thiel implies, we might finally know the truth about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and whether the coronavirus was a bioweapon. Thiel notes that the internet also has questions about the death of the well-connected sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “Trump’s return to the White House augurs the apokálypsis”—that is, a revealing—“of the ancien regime’s secrets,” he adds. (Two pretentious expressions in one sentence? Monsieur, watch out for hubris.) Thiel wants large-scale declassifications and a truth-and-reconciliation commission, in the model of South Africa’s reckoning with apartheid. “The apokálypsis cannot resolve our fights over 1619,” Thiel writes, referring to the year the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia, “but it can resolve our fights over Covid-19; it will not adjudicate the sins of our first rulers, but the sins of those who govern us today.” Thiel portrays Trump’s resurgence as a defeat for the “Distributed Idea Suppression Complex,” or DISC—his friend and employee Eric Weinstein’s term for legacy media outlets and nongovernmental organizations that supposedly prevent politically inconvenient truths from reaching the public. Thanks to the internet, information can no longer be suppressed. Like most classic conspiracism, Thiel’s arguments contain grains of truth. As Naomi Klein’s Doppelganger wisely notes, “The line between unsupported conspiracy claims and reliable investigative research is neither as firm nor as stable as many of us would like to believe.” Thiel is right that some liberal commentators and mainstream outlets were too quick to dismiss the question of whether COVID-19 originated anywhere other than a Wuhan meat market. At one point , a New York Times reporter suggested on Twitter that racism underlay any suspicions that the virus had escaped from a research lab. None of this shows, however, that the coronavirus was a bioweapon, or that Anthony Fauci deserves to be prosecuted. (For that matter, the Times has run multiple articles that are open-minded about the origins of the virus.) In any case, who was president in 2020, when the COVID-origins debate was emerging? If any classified evidence existed that would have cleared up the controversy, Donald Trump had the power to disclose it. From the October 2023 issue: From feminist to right-wing conspiracist As for Epstein, his death, in 2019, was certainly very convenient for anyone who might have been embarrassed by what he knew. Nevertheless, the so-called mainstream media are not covering up the lingering questions; definitive answers simply aren’t available, and may never be. (CBS broadcast an episode of 60 Minutes with graphic photos of Epstein’s autopsy all the way back in January 2020.) Besides, if anyone is hiding the truth about Epstein, it’s probably not the left-wing blob. Who would benefit from killing a man who hung out with Trump , Prince Andrew, and various tech billionaires ? Probably not blue-haired vegans from Portland, Oregon; racial-justice campaigners; or humanities academics. Meanwhile, the idea that anyone stifled doubts about the official explanation of the Kennedy assassination before social media is laughable. The subject has captivated Americans for more than six decades. Oliver Stone’s JFK , which highlighted florid conspiracy theories about the former president’s death, came out in 1991. The film starred Kevin Costner and won two Oscars. Thiel’s quest for closure about the pandemic is noteworthy. Something happened during that period to drive influential, apparently rational people toward beliefs that were once associated with crackpots. Others suddenly lost trust in institutions and expertise. The podcaster Bryan Johnson—a successful tech entrepreneur who is now pursuing literal immortality—went from boasting about receiving the Moderna vaccine in 2021, because he had invested in one of the companies involved in its development, to complaining that “vaccines are a holy war” and that he regretted getting a COVID shot because not enough data supported its use. This is a man who pops enough pills that if you shook him, he’d rattle. Read: I went to a rave with a 46-year-old millionaire who claims to have the body of a teenager High-profile figures across the political right have revealed their penchant for woo-woo. Skepticism of conventional medicine has become a staple of heterodox podcasts that simultaneously promote unproven, unregulated dietary supplements. My colleague Anne Applebaum has described this trend toward mysticism, fringe religious beliefs, and pseudo-spirituality as the New Obscurantism . Until recently, I had assumed that the anti-establishment sentiments promoted by Thiel and others were merely opportunistic, a way for elites to stoke a form of anti-elitism that somehow excluded themselves as targets of popular rage. Thiel has always made a point of entertaining provocative heterodox opinions, but he has also demonstrated himself to be eloquent, analytical, and capable of going whole paragraphs without saying something unhinged. But reading his Financial Times column, I thought: My God, he actually believes this stuff . The entire tone is reminiscent of a stranger sitting down next to you on public transit and whispering that the FBI is following him. The correct response to uncertainty is humility, not conspiracy. But conspiracy is exactly what many of those who are influential in Trump’s orbit have succumbed to—everything must be a product of the DISC, or the deep state, or the World Economic Forum, or other sinister and hidden controlling hands. The cynical Tucker Carlson of the Dominion era has given way to a more crankish version since his firing from Fox. When Carlson first went independent, he seemed to be hosting kooks for clicks. On his live tour, for example, he looked faintly embarrassed as Roseanne Barr told him that Democrats “love the taste of human flesh and they drink human blood.” And maybe he didn’t really believe the former crack user who claimed to have had a gay affair with Barack Obama, or the historian who asserts that Winston Churchill—not Adolf Hitler—was the “chief villain” in the Second World War. But at a certain point, I started to take Carlson at his word. Recently, he claimed that he’d woken up with scars and claw marks after being attacked by a demon in his bedroom. A few days before this, he said that America needed a “vigorous spanking” from Daddy Trump, and a few days after, Carlson revealed that he thought demons had invented the atom bomb. He’s clearly working through some stuff. What can we learn from this kind of credulity? First, that maintaining an appropriate level of skepticism is the intellectual discipline needed to navigate the rest of the 2020s. Yes, the legacy media will get things wrong. But that doesn’t mean you should believe every seductive narrative floating around online, particularly when it’s peddled by those who are trying to sell you something. The second lesson is that, no matter how smart a person might be in their business dealings, humans are all prone to the same lizard-brain preference for narratives over facts. That makes choosing your information sources carefully even more important. If you spend all day listening to people who think that every inexplicable event has a malevolent hand behind it, you will start to believe that too. The fact that this paranoia has eaten up America’s most influential men is an apokálypsis of its own. About the Author Helen Lewis Follow Helen Lewis is a staff writer at The Atlantic.

Share Copy Link &#10003; Link copied to clipboard! Curtis Yarvin, a conservative blogger who advocates transforming American democracy into a ""monarchy,"" among other political theories, has promoted ideas that have garnered support and interest from some notable Republicans , including Vice President-elect JD Vance , who is set to take office in two days. Newsweek has reached out to the Trump-Vance transition team for comment via email on Saturday. Newsweek was unable to identify a contact email for Yarvin. Why It Matters Vance has previously referenced Yarvin by name in interviews, suggesting some of his theories have shaped some of Vance's political thinking. As Yarvin has advocated for transforming the U.S. government from a democracy to a monarchy, some are concerned about the potential influence of his ideas on the incoming administration. Critics of President-elect Donald Trump have voiced fears about the possible erosion of democracy under his leadership, citing his repeated claims that the 2020 election was stolen, his appointment of billionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser, and comments of persecuting political rivals, among other actions. Who Is Curtis Yarvin? Yarvin, 51, is a software engineer who started blogging under the pen name Mencius Moldbug in 2007. He has since started a new blog and made numerous appearances on online platforms and podcasts to discuss political theory and what is now known as ""dark enlightenment"" thinking. He largely argues that governmental bureaucracy should be stripped, and that the U.S. should be replaced with a more centralized ""monarchy"" run by as a corporation with a chief executive officer. Yarvin is critical of what he calls ""the cathedral,"" which he defines in his Gray Mirror Substack as, ""'journalism plus academia'&mdash;in other words, the intellectual institutions at the center of modern society, just as the Church was the intellectual institution at the center of medieval society."" His Substack has over 49,000 followers. In an interview published Saturday in The New York Times , when asked ""why is democracy so bad?"" Yarvin replied: ""It's not even that democracy is bad; it's just that it's very weak. And the fact that it's very weak is easily seen by the fact that very unpopular policies like mass immigration persist despite strong majorities being against them."" His political thinking and ideas have reached top members of Trump's administration, most notably Vance. However, in the recent Times ' interview Yarvin noted that their relationship is ""definitely overstated.""

Yarvin, meanwhile, has also garnered support from Silicon Valley leaders, including Peter Thiel , the co-founder of PayPal and a friend of Vance's, among others, and Trump's incoming top State Department official Michael Anton. Yarvin spoke about installing an ""American Caesar"" on Anton's podcast.

More Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP Images What People Are Saying Writer Malcolm Harris shared the Times' interview with Yarvin in an X, formerly Twitter, post on Saturday morning and wrote: ""Pathetic what passes for an intellectual on the right."" Write Jacob Silverman also shared the article on X and wrote : ""Not a good writer, not a novel or interesting thinker, but he gives his tech-lord adherents a permission structure to abandon democracy and embrace their inner dictator."" Alex Tabarrok, an economist and professor at George Mason University, wrote on X on Saturday: ""Whiplash. Two years ago and the mere mention of his name would get you cancelled."" Robert Evans, host of the podcast Behind the Bastards , said in a recent episode about Yarvin: ""What's unique is his way of rebranding or repackaging old reactionary ideas in a way that appealed to libertarian-minded kids in the tech industry, and in eventually getting some of them to embrace a lot of far-right ideas. That's the novelty of Yarvin and that's his real accomplishment."" What Happens Next Yarvin has said the time for changing American democracy into a monarchy is not yet here, telling the Times that ""no one should be reading this panicking, thinking I'm about to be installed as America's secret dictator.""

Many of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans.&nbsp; Others are engaged in hostile activities, including espionage, economic espionage, and preparations for terror-related activities. &nbsp;Many have abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence in the United States has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels. Enforcing our Nation&#8217;s immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States.&nbsp; The American people deserve a Federal Government that puts their interests first and a Government that understands its sacred obligation to prioritize the safety, security, and financial and economic well-being of Americans. This order ensures that the Federal Government protects the American people by faithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens, particularly those aliens who threaten the safety or security of the American people. &nbsp;Further, it is the policy of the United States to achieve the total and efficient enforcement of those laws, including through lawful incentives and detention capabilities. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Faithful Execution of the Immigration Laws. &nbsp;In furtherance of the policies described in section 2 of this order: (a) &nbsp;Executive Order 13993 of January 20, 2021 (Revision of Civil Immigration Enforcement Policies and Priorities), Executive Order 14010 of February 2, 2021 (Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework To Address the Causes of Migration, To Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and To Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border), Executive Order 14011 of February 2, 2021 (Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families), and Executive Order 14012 of February 2, 2021 (Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans) are hereby revoked; and (b) &nbsp;Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to promptly revoke all memoranda, guidance, or other policies based on the Executive Orders revoked in section 3(a) of this order and shall employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all inadmissible and removable aliens. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Civil Enforcement Priorities. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to enable the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to set priorities for their agencies that protect the public safety and national security interests of the American people, including by ensuring the successful enforcement of final orders of removal.&nbsp; Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that the primary mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#8217;s Homeland Security Investigations division is the enforcement of the provisions of the INA and other Federal laws related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States and the enforcement of the purposes of this order. Sec. 5. &nbsp;Criminal Enforcement Priorities. &nbsp;The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of criminal offenses related to the unauthorized entry or continued unauthorized presence of aliens in the United States. Sec. 6. &nbsp;Federal Homeland Security Task Forces. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to jointly establish Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) in all States nationwide. (b)&nbsp; The composition of each HSTF shall be subject to the direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, but shall include representation from any other Federal agencies with law enforcement officers, or agencies with the ability to provide logistics, intelligence, and operational support to the HSTFs, and shall also include representation from relevant State and local law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; The heads of all Federal agencies shall take all appropriate action to provide support to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the HSTFs fulfill the objectives in subsection (c) of this section, and any other lawful purpose that fulfills the policy objectives of this order. (c)&nbsp; The objective of each HSTF is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations throughout the United States, dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks, end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children, and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States. (d)&nbsp; The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to provide an operational command center to coordinate the activities of the HSTFs and provide such support as they may require, and shall also take all appropriate action to provide supervisory direction to their activities as may be required. Sec. 7. &nbsp;Identification of Unregistered Illegal Aliens. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to: (a) &nbsp;Immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code; (b)&nbsp; Ensure that all previously unregistered aliens in the United States comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code; and (c) &nbsp;Ensure that failure to comply with the legal obligations of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code, is treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority. Sec. 8. &nbsp;Civil Fines and Penalties. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Treasury, shall take all appropriate action to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized by law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States, including aliens who unlawfully entered or unlawfully attempted to enter the United States, and from those who facilitate such aliens&#8217; presence in the United States. (b)&nbsp; Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to the President regarding their progress implementing the requirements of this section and recommending any additional actions that may need to be taken to achieve its objectives. Sec. 9. &nbsp;Efficient Removals of Recent Entrants and Other Aliens. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action, pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)), to apply, in her sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). &nbsp;Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take appropriate action to use all other provisions of the immigration laws or any other Federal law, including, but not limited to sections 238 and 240(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1228 and 1229a(d)), to ensure the efficient and expedited removal of aliens from the United States. Sec. 10. &nbsp;Detention Facilities. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources or establish contracts to construct, operate, control, or use facilities to detain removable aliens. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security, further, shall take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country, to the extent permitted by law. Sec. 11. &nbsp;Federal-State Agreements. &nbsp;To ensure State and local law enforcement agencies across the United States can assist with the protection of the American people, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials as appropriate, take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)) or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary of Homeland Security. &nbsp;Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties. &nbsp;To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary of Homeland Security may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)) in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws in that jurisdiction. Sec. 12. &nbsp;Encouraging Voluntary Compliance with the Law. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, and subject to adequate safeguards, assurances, bonds, and any other lawful measure, to adopt policies and procedures to encourage aliens unlawfully in the United States to voluntarily depart as soon as possible, including through enhanced usage of the provisions of section 240B of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1229c), international agreements or assistance, or any other measures that encourage aliens unlawfully in the United States to depart as promptly as possible, including through removals of aliens as provided by section 250 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1260). Sec. 13. &nbsp;Recalcitrant Countries. &nbsp;The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to: (a) &nbsp;Cooperate and effectively implement, as appropriate, the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), with the Secretary of State, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensuring that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include the foreign states&#8217; acceptance of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States; and (b) &nbsp;Eliminate all documentary barriers, dilatory tactics, or other restrictions that prevent the prompt repatriation of aliens to any foreign state.&nbsp; Any failure or delay by a foreign state to verify the identity of a national of that state shall be considered in carrying out subsection (a) this section, and shall also be considered regarding the issuance of any other sanctions that may be available to the United States. Sec. 14.&nbsp; Visa Bonds. &nbsp;The Secretary of Treasury shall take all appropriate action, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish a system to facilitate the administration of all bonds that the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may lawfully require to administer the provisions of the INA. Sec. 15. &nbsp;Reestablishment of the VOICE Office and Addressing Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take all appropriate and lawful action to reestablish within ICE an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens, and those victims&#8217; family members. &nbsp;The Attorney General shall also ensure that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3771 are followed in all Federal prosecutions involving crimes committed by removable aliens. Sec. 16. &nbsp;Addressing Actions by the Previous Administration. &nbsp;The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to rescind the policy decisions of the previous administration that led to the increased or continued presence of illegal aliens in the United States, and align any and all departmental activities with the policies set out by this order and the immigration laws. &nbsp;Such action should include, but is not limited to: (a) &nbsp;ensuring that the parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised on only a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual alien demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from their particular continued presence in the United States arising from such parole; (b) &nbsp;ensuring that designations of Temporary Protected Status are consistent with the provisions of section 244 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1254a), and that such designations are appropriately limited in scope and made for only so long as may be necessary to fulfill the textual requirements of that statute; and (c) &nbsp;ensuring that employment authorization is provided in a manner consistent with section 274A of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324a), and that employment authorization is not provided to any unauthorized alien in the United States. Sec. 17. &nbsp;Sanctuary Jurisdictions. &nbsp;The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the maximum extent possible under law, evaluate and undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds. &nbsp;Further, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall evaluate and undertake any other lawful actions, criminal or civil, that they deem warranted based on any such jurisdiction&#8217;s practices that interfere with the enforcement of Federal law. Sec. 18. &nbsp;Information Sharing. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly issue guidance to ensure maximum compliance by Department of Homeland Security personnel with the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1373 and 8 U.S.C. 1644 and ensure that State and local governments are provided with the information necessary to fulfill law enforcement, citizenship, or immigration status verification requirements authorized by law; and (b)&nbsp; The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to stop the trafficking and smuggling of alien children into the United States, including through the sharing of any information necessary to assist in the achievement of that objective. Sec. 19. &nbsp;Funding Review.&nbsp; The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall: (a) &nbsp;Immediately review and, if appropriate, audit all contracts, grants, or other agreements providing Federal funding to non-governmental organizations supporting or providing services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens, to ensure that such agreements conform to applicable law and are free of waste, fraud, and abuse, and that they do not promote or facilitate violations of our immigration laws; (b) &nbsp;Pause distribution of all further funds pursuant to such agreements pending the results of the review in subsection (a) of this section; (c) &nbsp;Terminate all such agreements determined to be in violation of law or to be sources of waste, fraud, or abuse and prohibit any such future agreements; (d) &nbsp;Coordinate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that no funding for agreements described in subsection (c) of this section is included in any appropriations request for the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security; and (e) &nbsp;Initiate clawback or recoupment procedures, if appropriate, for any agreements described in subsection (c) of this section. Sec. 20.&nbsp; Denial of Public Benefits to Illegal Aliens.&nbsp; The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall take all appropriate action to ensure that all agencies identify and stop the provision of any public benefits to any illegal alien not authorized to receive them under the provisions of the INA or other relevant statutory provisions. Sec. 21. &nbsp;Hiring More Agents and Officers.&nbsp; Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall take all appropriate action to significantly increase the number of agents and officers available to perform the duties of immigration officers. Sec. 22. &nbsp;Severability. &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States to enforce this order to the maximum extent possible to advance the interests of the United States. Accordingly: (a) &nbsp;If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and (b) &nbsp;If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the failure to follow certain procedures, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders.

DEFENDING WOMEN FROM GENDER IDEOLOGY EXTREMISM AND RESTORING BIOLOGICAL TRUTH TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,EXECUTIVE ORDER,20/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/,"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions DEFENDING WOMEN FROM GENDER IDEOLOGY EXTREMISM AND RESTORING BIOLOGICAL TRUTH TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXECUTIVE ORDER January 20, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. &nbsp;Purpose. &nbsp;Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women&#8217;s domestic abuse shelters to women&#8217;s workplace showers. &nbsp;This is wrong. &nbsp;Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. &nbsp;The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. &nbsp;Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.&nbsp; Invalidating the true and biological category of &#8220;woman&#8221; improperly transforms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. Accordingly, my Administration will defend women&#8217;s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.&nbsp; Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy and Definitions. &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. &nbsp;These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. &nbsp;Under my direction, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpretation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: (a) &nbsp;&#8220;Sex&#8221; shall refer to an individual&#8217;s immutable biological classification as either male or female. &nbsp;&#8220;Sex&#8221; is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of &#8220;gender identity.&#8221; (b) &nbsp;&#8220;Women&#8221; or &#8220;woman&#8221; and &#8220;girls&#8221; or &#8220;girl&#8221; shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c) &nbsp;&#8220;Men&#8221; or &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;boys&#8221; or &#8220;boy&#8221; shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d) &nbsp;&#8220;Female&#8221; means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. (e) &nbsp;&#8220;Male&#8221; means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell. (f) &nbsp;&#8220;Gender ideology&#8221; replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true. &nbsp;Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g) &nbsp;&#8220;Gender identity&#8221; reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) &nbsp;Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. &nbsp;Each agency should therefore give the terms &#8220;sex&#8221;, &#8220;male&#8221;, &#8220;female&#8221;, &#8220;men&#8221;, &#8220;women&#8221;, &#8220;boys&#8221; and &#8220;girls&#8221; the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) &nbsp;When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term &#8220;sex&#8221; and not &#8220;gender&#8221; in all applicable Federal policies and documents. (d) &nbsp;The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder&#8217;s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees&#8217; sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) &nbsp;Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. &nbsp;Agency forms that require an individual&#8217;s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity.&nbsp; Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. (f) &nbsp;The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act.&nbsp; This position is legally untenable and has harmed women.&nbsp; The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities.&nbsp; In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) &nbsp;Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.&nbsp; Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Privacy in Intimate Spaces .&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women&#8217;s prisons or housed in women&#8217;s detention centers, including through amendment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall prepare and submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final rule entitled &#8220;Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual&#8217;s Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs&#8221; of September 21, 2016, 81 FR 64763, and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters.&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate&#8217;s appearance to that of the opposite sex. (d) &nbsp;Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. Sec. 5. &nbsp;Protecting Rights. &nbsp;The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&nbsp; In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize investigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified. Sec. 6.&nbsp; Bill Text. &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order. Sec. 7. &nbsp;Agency Implementation and Reporting. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementation of this order to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. &nbsp;That update shall address: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and (ii) &nbsp;agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order. (b) &nbsp;The requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous Executive Orders or Presidential Memoranda, including but not limited to Executive Orders 13988 of January 20, 2021, 14004 of January 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of March 8, 2021, and 14075 of June 15, 2022.&nbsp; These Executive Orders are hereby rescinded, and the White House Gender Policy Council established by Executive Order 14020 is dissolved. (c) &nbsp;Each agency head shall promptly rescind all guidance documents inconsistent with the requirements of this order or the Attorney General&#8217;s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such manner. &nbsp;Such documents include, but are not limited to: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality&#8221;; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;the Department of Education&#8217;s guidance documents including: (A)&nbsp; &#8220;2024 Title IX Regulations: Pointers for Implementation&#8221; (July 2024); (B)&nbsp; &#8220;U.S. Department of Education Toolkit: Creating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students&#8221;; (C)&nbsp; &#8220;U.S. Department of Education Supporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School&#8221; (June 21, 2023); (D)&nbsp; &#8220;Departamento de Educación de EE.UU.&nbsp; Apoyar a los jóvenes y familias LGBTQI+ en la escuela&#8221; (June 21, 2023); (E)&nbsp; &#8220;Supporting Intersex Students: A Resource for Students, Families, and Educators&#8221; (October 2021); (F)&nbsp; &#8220;Supporting Transgender Youth in School&#8221; (June 2021); (G)&nbsp; &#8220;Letter to Educators on Title IX&#8217;s 49th Anniversary&#8221; (June 23, 2021); (H)&nbsp; &#8220;Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A Resource for Students and Families&#8221; (June 2021); (I)&nbsp; &#8220;Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v.

Sec. 2.&nbsp; Implementation.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), assisted by the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), shall coordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and &#8220;diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility&#8221; (DEIA) mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government, under whatever name they appear. &nbsp;To carry out this directive, the Director of OPM, with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall review and revise, as appropriate, all existing Federal employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs to comply with this order. &nbsp;Federal employment practices, including Federal employee performance reviews, shall reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and shall not under any circumstances consider DEI or DEIA factors, goals, policies, mandates, or requirements. (b) &nbsp;Each agency, department, or commission head, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director of OPM, as appropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty days of this order: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; offices and positions (including but not limited to &#8220;Chief Diversity Officer&#8221; positions); all &#8220;equity action plans,&#8221; &#8220;equity&#8221; actions, initiatives, or programs, &#8220;equity-related&#8221; grants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees. (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; provide the Director of the OMB with a list of all: (A) &nbsp;agency or department DEI, DEIA, or &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures in existence on November 4, 2024, and an assessment of whether these positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures have been misleadingly relabeled in an attempt to preserve their pre-November 4, 2024 function; (B) &nbsp;Federal contractors who have provided DEI training or DEI training materials to agency or department employees; and (C) &nbsp;Federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021. (iii) &nbsp;direct the deputy agency or department head to: (A) assess the operational impact (e.g., the number of new DEI hires) and cost of the prior administration&#8217;s DEI, DEIA, and &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; programs and policies; and (B) recommend actions, such as Congressional notifications under 28 U.S.C. 530D, to align agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions with the policy of equal dignity and respect identified in section 1 of this order. &nbsp;The agency or department head and the Director of OMB shall jointly ensure that the deputy agency or department head has the authority and resources needed to carry out this directive. (c) &nbsp;To inform and advise the President, so that he may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policies for the Executive Branch, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall convene a monthly meeting attended by the Director of OMB, the Director of OPM, and each deputy agency or department head to: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear reports on the prevalence and the economic and social costs of DEI, DEIA, and &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; in agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;discuss any barriers to measures to comply with this order; and (iii) &nbsp;monitor and track agency and department progress and identify potential areas for additional Presidential or legislative action to advance the policy of equal dignity and respect. Sec. 3.&nbsp; Severability. &nbsp;If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected.

(b)&nbsp; The Secretary of the Interior shall review and consider additional appointments to the Board to assist in fulfilling all aspects of this order, subject to all applicable laws. (c)&nbsp; With respect to all applications for naming and renaming submitted to the newly constituted Board, the Board shall advance the policy established in section 1 of this order to honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans and may update its principles, policies, and procedures as needed to achieve this policy. (d)&nbsp; Where Congressional action is required to establish a renaming in public law, following Board approval on renaming, the Board shall provide guidance to all relevant Federal agencies to use the Board-approved name in the interim in federal documents and achieve consistency across the federal government. Sec. 3.&nbsp; Renaming of Mount McKinley.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; President William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, heroically led our Nation to victory in the Spanish-American War.&nbsp; Under his leadership, the United States enjoyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation.&nbsp; President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. industrialization and global reach to new heights.&nbsp; He was tragically assassinated in an attack on our Nation&#8217;s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to American greatness. In 1917, the country officially honored President McKinley through the naming of North America&#8217;s highest peak.&nbsp; Yet after nearly a century, President Obama&#8217;s administration, in 2015, stripped the McKinley name from federal nomenclature, an affront to President McKinley&#8217;s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice. This order honors President McKinley for giving his life for our great Nation and dutifully recognizes his historic legacy of protecting America&#8217;s interests and generating enormous wealth for all Americans. (b)&nbsp; Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, reinstate the name &#8220;Mount McKinley.&#8221;&nbsp; The Secretary shall subsequently update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.&nbsp; The national park area surrounding Mount McKinley shall retain the name Denali National Park and Preserve. (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of the Interior shall work with Alaska Native entities and state and local organizations to adopt names for landmarks to honor the history and culture of the Alaskan people. Sec. 4.&nbsp; Gulf of America.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America.&nbsp; The Gulf was a crucial artery for America&#8217;s early trade and global commerce.&nbsp; It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres.&nbsp; Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America&#8217;s economy today.&nbsp; The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation&#8217;s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world.&nbsp; The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies.&nbsp; The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities.&nbsp; Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world.&nbsp; The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America&#8217;s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation&#8217;s economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America. (b)&nbsp; As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the &#8220;Gulf of America&#8221; the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; The Secretary shall subsequently update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law.&nbsp; The Board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications shall reflect its renaming. Sec. 5.&nbsp; Additional Action.&nbsp; The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly in light of America&#8217;s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. Sec. 6.&nbsp; General Provisions.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Deadly narcotics and other illicit materials have flowed across the border while agents and officers spend their limited resources processing illegal aliens for release into the United States. &nbsp;These catch-and-release policies undermine the rule of law and our sovereignty, create substantial risks to public safety and security, and divert critical resources away from stopping the entry of contraband and fugitives into the United States. &nbsp; We have limited information on the precise whereabouts of a great number of these illegal aliens who have entered the United States over the last 4 years. This cannot stand. &nbsp;A nation without borders is not a nation, and the Federal Government must act with urgency and strength to end the threats posed by an unsecured border. One of my most important obligations is to protect the American people from the disastrous effects of unlawful mass migration and resettlement. My Administration will marshal all available resources and authorities to stop this unprecedented flood of illegal aliens into the United States. Sec. 2.&nbsp; Policy . &nbsp; It is the policy of the United States to take all appropriate action to secure the borders of our Nation through the following means: &nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Establishing a physical wall and other barriers monitored and supported by adequate personnel and technology; (b) &nbsp;Deterring and preventing the entry of illegal aliens into the United States; (c)&nbsp; Detaining, to the maximum extent authorized by law, aliens apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, until such time as they are removed from the United States; (d) &nbsp;Removing promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of Federal law; (e)&nbsp; Pursuing criminal charges against illegal aliens who violate the immigration laws, and against those who facilitate their unlawful presence in the United States; (f) &nbsp;Cooperating fully with State and local law enforcement officials in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities; and (g) &nbsp;Obtaining complete operational control of the borders of the United States. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Physical Barriers. &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to deploy and construct temporary and permanent physical barriers to ensure complete operational control of the southern border of the United States. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Deployment of Personnel. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate and lawful action to deploy sufficient personnel along the southern border of the United States to ensure complete operational control; and (b) &nbsp;The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to supplement available personnel to secure the southern border and enforce the immigration laws of the United States through the use of sections 1103(a)(2) and (4)-(6) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(2) and (4)-(6)). Sec. 5. &nbsp;Detention. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate actions to detain, to the fullest extent permitted by law, aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law until their successful removal from the United States. &nbsp;The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, issue new policy guidance or propose regulations regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as &#8220;catch-and-release,&#8221; whereby illegal aliens are routinely released into the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law. Sec. 6. &nbsp;Resumption of Migrant Protection Protocols. &nbsp;As soon as practicable, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to resume the Migrant Protection Protocols in all sectors along the southern border of the United States and ensure that, pending removal proceedings, aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came. Sec. 7. &nbsp;Adjusting Parole Policies. &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate action to: (a) &nbsp;Cease using the &#8220;CBP One&#8221; application as a method of paroling or facilitating the entry of otherwise inadmissible aliens into the United States; (b) &nbsp;Terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States established in my Executive Orders, including the program known as the &#8220;Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.&#8221; (c) &nbsp;Align all policies and operations at the southern border of the United States to be consistent with the policy of Section 2 of this order and ensure that all future parole determinations fully comply with this order and with applicable law. Sec. 8. &nbsp;Additional International Cooperation. &nbsp;The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to facilitate additional international cooperation and agreements, consistent with the policy of Section 2, including entering into agreements based upon the provisions of section 208(a)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)(A)) or any other applicable provision of law. Sec. 9. &nbsp;DNA and Identification Requirements. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to fulfill the requirements of the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005, title X of Public Law 109-162, for all aliens detained under the authority of the United States; and (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to use any available technologies and procedures to determine the validity of any claimed familial relationship between aliens encountered or apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security. Sec. 10. &nbsp;Prosecution of Offenses. &nbsp;The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of offenses that relate to the borders of the United States, including the investigation and prosecution of offenses that involve human smuggling, human trafficking, child trafficking, and sex trafficking in the United States. Sec. 11.&nbsp; Additional Measures.&nbsp; Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide recommendations to the President regarding the use of any other authority to protect the United States from foreign threats and secure the southern border. Sec. 12. &nbsp;General Provisions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of the Interior shall report to me regarding the progress made in implementing the policies in this memorandum and provide any recommendations regarding future implementation.

RESTORING THE DEATH PENALTY AND PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY,EXECUTIVE ORDER,20/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-the-death-penalty-and-protecting-public-safety/,"Restoring The Death Penalty And Protecting Public Safety &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions RESTORING THE DEATH PENALTY AND PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY EXECUTIVE ORDER January 20, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1.&nbsp; Purpose.&nbsp; Capital punishment is an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes and acts of lethal violence against American citizens. &nbsp;Before, during, and after the founding of the United States, our cities, States, and country have continuously relied upon capital punishment as the ultimate deterrent and only proper punishment for the vilest crimes. &nbsp;Our Founders knew well that only capital punishment can bring justice and restore order in response to such evil. &nbsp;For this and other reasons, capital punishment continues to enjoy broad popular support. Yet for too long, politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment have defied and subverted the laws of our country. &nbsp;At every turn, they seek to thwart the execution of lawfully imposed capital sentences and choose to enforce their personal beliefs rather than the law. &nbsp;When President Biden took office in 2021, he allowed his Department of Justice to issue a moratorium on Federal executions, in defiance of his duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States that provide for capital punishment. &nbsp;And on December 23, 2024, President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 most vile and sadistic rapists, child molesters, and murderers on Federal death row: &nbsp;remorseless criminals who brutalized young children, strangled and drowned their victims, and hunted strangers for sport. &nbsp;He commuted their sentences even though the laws of our Nation have always protected victims by applying capital punishment to barbaric acts like theirs. &nbsp;Judges who oppose capital punishment have likewise disregarded the law by falsely claiming that capital punishment is unconstitutional, even though the Constitution explicitly acknowledges the legality of capital punishment. These efforts to subvert and undermine capital punishment defy the laws of our nation, make a mockery of justice, and insult the victims of these horrible crimes. &nbsp;The Government&#8217;s most solemn responsibility is to protect its citizens from abhorrent acts, and my Administration will not tolerate efforts to stymie and eviscerate the laws that authorize capital punishment against those who commit horrible acts of violence against American citizens. Sec. 2.&nbsp; Policy.&nbsp; It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the laws that authorize capital punishment are respected and faithfully implemented, and to counteract the politicians and judges who subvert the law by obstructing and preventing the execution of capital sentences. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Federal Capital Punishment. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use. (b) In addition to pursuing the death penalty where possible, the Attorney General shall, where consistent with applicable law, pursue Federal jurisdiction and seek the death penalty regardless of other factors for every federal capital crime involving: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;The murder of a law-enforcement officer; or (ii) &nbsp;A capital crime committed by an alien illegally present in this country. The Attorney General shall encourage State attorneys general and district attorneys to bring State capital charges for all capital crimes with special attention to the crimes described in Subsections (i) and (ii), regardless of whether the federal trial results in a capital sentence. (d) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to modify the Justice Manual based on the policy and purpose set forth in this Executive Order. (e) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall evaluate the places of imprisonment and conditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose Federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden, and the Attorney General shall take all lawful and appropriate action to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose. &nbsp;The Attorney General shall further evaluate whether these offenders can be charged with State capital crimes and shall recommend appropriate action to state and local authorities. Sec. 4.&nbsp; Preserving Capital Punishment in the States. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall take all necessary and lawful action to ensure that each state that allows capital punishment has a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection. (b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to approve or deny any pending request for certification made by any State under 28 U.S.C. 2265. Sec. 5.&nbsp; Seeking The Overruling of Supreme Court Precedents That Hinder Capital Punishment.&nbsp; The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of State and Federal governments to impose capital punishment. Sec. 6.&nbsp; Prosecuting Crime to Protect Communities. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall appropriately prioritize public safety and the prosecution of violent crime, and take all appropriate action necessary to dismantle transnational criminal activity in the United States. (b) &nbsp;To ensure the fullest protection of American communities from violence, the Attorney General shall encourage state attorneys general and district attorneys to adopt policies and practices aligned with subsection (a). &nbsp;Federal law enforcement should coordinate with State and local law enforcement where possible to facilitate these objectives. Sec. 7.&nbsp; General Provisions.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , 591 U.S. 197, 203 (2020).&nbsp; &#8220;Because no single person could fulfill that responsibility alone, the Framers expected that the President would rely on subordinate officers for assistance.&#8221;&nbsp; Id. at 203–04.&nbsp;&nbsp; The President&#8217;s power to remove subordinates is a core part of the Executive power vested by Article II of the Constitution and is necessary for the President to perform his duty to &#8220;take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.&#8221; &nbsp;Because SES officials wield significant governmental authority, they must serve at the pleasure of the President.&nbsp; Only that chain of responsibility ensures that SES officials are properly accountable to the President and the American people. &nbsp;If career SES officials fail to faithfully fulfill their duties to advance the needs, policies, and goals of the United States, the President must be able to rectify the situation and ensure that the entire Executive Branch faithfully executes the law.&nbsp; For instance, SES officials who engage in unauthorized disclosure of Executive Branch deliberations, violate the constitutional rights of Americans, refuse to implement policy priorities, or perform their duties inefficiently or negligently should be held accountable.&nbsp; The President must be able to trust that the Executive Branch will work together in service of the Nation. &nbsp;My Administration will restore a &#8220;government of the people, by the people, for the people.&#8221; &nbsp;Therefore:&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Within 30 days of the signing of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall issue SES Performance Plans that agencies must adopt; (b) &nbsp;Agency heads, who along with their senior staff manage career SES officials as one of their core functions, shall use all available authorities to reinvigorate the SES system and prioritize accountability; (c) &nbsp;Each agency head shall, as necessary and appropriate and consistent with the procedural requirements of section 3395 of title 5, United States Code, reassign agency SES members to ensure their knowledge, skills, abilities, and mission assignments are optimally aligned to implement my agenda; &nbsp; (d) &nbsp;Each agency head should terminate its existing Executive Resources Board (ERB), institute a new or interim ERB, and assign senior noncareer officials to chair and serve on the board as a majority alongside career members; (e) &nbsp;Each agency head should terminate its existing Performance Review Board membership and re-constitute membership with individuals committed to full enforcement of SES performance evaluations that promote and assure an SES of the highest caliber; and (f) &nbsp;Any agency head who becomes aware of an SES official whose performance or continued occupancy of the position is inconsistent with either the principles reaffirmed in this Order or their duties to the Nation under section 3131 of title 5, United States Code, shall immediately take all appropriate actions, up to and including removal of that official, with the support of OPM and OMB. &nbsp;Restoring an accountable government workforce is a top priority of my Administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; News Administration Issues Contact Visit The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 X Instagram Facebook WH.GOV Copyright Privacy",4788

The United States Government&#8217;s decision-making structures and processes to address national security challenges must therefore be equally adaptive and comprehensive.&nbsp; They must be able to competently design and execute cooperative and integrated interagency solutions to address these problems, and protect and advance the national interests of the United States.&nbsp; Therefore, to advise and assist me in this endeavor, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development, decision-making, implementation, and monitoring shall be organized as set forth in this Memorandum.&nbsp; This Memorandum prevails over any prior orders, directives, memoranda, or other Presidential guidance related to the organization of the National Security Council (NSC or Council).

This invasion has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last 4 years.&nbsp; It has led to the horrific and inexcusable murders of many innocent American citizens, including women and children, at the hands of illegal aliens. &nbsp;Foreign criminal gangs and cartels have begun seizing control of parts of cities, attacking our most vulnerable citizens, and terrorizing Americans beyond the control of local law enforcement.&nbsp; Cartels control vast territories just south of our southern border, effectively controlling who can and cannot travel to the United States from Mexico. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have tragically died from drug overdoses because of the illicit narcotics that have flowed across the southern border. This assault on the American people and the integrity of America&#8217;s sovereign borders represents a grave threat to our Nation. Because of the gravity and emergency of this present danger and imminent threat, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to take all appropriate action to assist the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining full operational control of the southern border. To protect the security and safety of United States citizens, to protect each of the States against invasion, and to uphold my duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it is my responsibility as President to ensure that the illegal entry of aliens into the United States via the southern border be immediately and entirely stopped. As Commander in Chief, I have no more solemn duty than to protect the American people. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq .), hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, and that section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretaries of the military departments concerned, subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense. &nbsp;To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government&#8217;s response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments. &nbsp;I&nbsp;hereby direct as follows: Section 1. &nbsp;Deployment of Personnel and Resources. &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Armed Forces, including the Ready Reserve and the National Guard, as the Secretary of Defense determines to be appropriate to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border of the United States. &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense shall further take all appropriate action to facilitate the operational needs of the Secretary of Homeland Security along the southern border, including through the provision of appropriate detention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services in support of civilian-controlled law enforcement operations. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Additional Physical Barriers. &nbsp;The Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall immediately take all appropriate action, consistent with law, including 10 U.S.C. 2214, to construct additional physical barriers along the southern border. &nbsp;To the extent possible, the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall coordinate with any Governor of a State that is willing to assist with the deployment of any physical infrastructure to improve operational security at the southern border. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Unmanned Aerial Systems. &nbsp;The Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission shall, consistent with applicable law, consider waiving all applicable Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission regulations or policies, respectively, that restrict the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s ability to counter unmanned aerial systems within 5 miles of the southern border. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Revision of Policies and Strategies. &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to prioritize the impedance and denial of the unauthorized physical entry of aliens across the southern border of the United States, and to ensure that use of force policies prioritize the safety and security of Department of Homeland Security personnel and of members of the Armed Forces. Sec. 5. &nbsp;Revocation. &nbsp;Proclamation 10142 of January 20, 2021 (Termination of Emergency With Respect to the Southern Border of the United States and Redirection of Funds Diverted to Border Wall Construction), is hereby revoked. Sec. 6. &nbsp;Reporting Requirement. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Within 30 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the President, through the Homeland Security Advisor, a report outlining all actions taken to fulfill the requirements and objectives of this proclamation; and (b)&nbsp; Within 90 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a joint report to the President about the conditions at the southern border of the United States and any recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.

UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY,EXECUTIVE ORDER,20/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/,"Unleashing American Energy &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY EXECUTIVE ORDER January 20, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:&nbsp; Section 1. &nbsp;Background . &nbsp;America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation&#8217;s economic prosperity. &nbsp;In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens. &nbsp;These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security. It is thus in the national interest to unleash America&#8217;s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. &nbsp;This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. &nbsp;It will also rebuild our Nation&#8217;s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp; It is the policy of the United States: (a) &nbsp;to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future; (b) &nbsp;to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states; (c) &nbsp;to protect the United States&#8217;s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation; (d) &nbsp;to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law; (e) &nbsp;to eliminate the &#8220;electric vehicle (EV) mandate&#8221; and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) &nbsp;to safeguard the American people&#8217;s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries; (g) &nbsp;to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people; (h) &nbsp;to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis; and (i) &nbsp;to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 3. &nbsp;Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agency actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources &#8212; with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources &#8212; or that are otherwise inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law. &nbsp;The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. (c) &nbsp;Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and (ii)&nbsp; request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the completion of the administrative actions described in this order. (d) &nbsp;Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions .&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The following are revoked and any offices established therein are abolished: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis); (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation); (iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad); (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology); (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration); (vi) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office); (vii) &nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk); (viii) &nbsp;Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks); (ix) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability); (x) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation&#8217;s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies); (xi) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and (xii) &nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation&#8217;s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All). (b) &nbsp;All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American Climate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated immediately.&nbsp; Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the &#8220;American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding&#8221; dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) &nbsp;The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities.&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) &nbsp;Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law.&nbsp; Sec. 5. &nbsp;Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked. (b) &nbsp;To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42&nbsp;U.S.C. 4321 et seq. , and propose rescinding CEQ&#8217;s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq. (c) &nbsp;Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level implementing regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5). &nbsp;Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process. (d) &nbsp; The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule. &nbsp;For any project an agency head deems essential for the Nation&#8217;s economy or national security, agencies shall use all possible authorities, including emergency authorities, to expedite the adjudication of Federal permits. &nbsp;Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects. (e) &nbsp;The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transportation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and (ii) &nbsp;provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA. Sec. 6. &nbsp;Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated. &nbsp;In fulfilling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodologies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated. (b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including:&nbsp; (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking);&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Interagency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System);&nbsp; (iii) &nbsp;the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG&#8217;s work or guidance. (c) &nbsp;The calculation of the &#8220;social cost of carbon&#8221; is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation. &nbsp;Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market. &nbsp;Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the &#8220;social cost of carbon&#8221; calculation from any Federal permitting or regulatory decision. (d) &nbsp;Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appropriate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A-4 of September 17, 2003 (Regulatory Analysis). (e) &nbsp;Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to any rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consistency with the Regulatory Analysis. (f) &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator&#8217;s findings, &#8220;Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,&#8221; Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009). Sec. 7. &nbsp;Terminating the Green New Deal. &nbsp; (a) &nbsp;All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. &nbsp;Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2. &nbsp;No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt. (b) &nbsp;When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent. &nbsp;The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection. (c) &nbsp;All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances. Sec. 8. &nbsp; Protecting America&#8217;s National Security.(a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law. &nbsp;In assessing the &#8220;Public Interest&#8221; to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application. (b) &nbsp;With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. , the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project proposed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the originally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different consequences). &nbsp;In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential consequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revisions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS. &nbsp;MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President. (c)&nbsp; Pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if MARAD determines that such refinements are not likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall include in that determination a description of the refinements to supplement and update the ROD, if necessary and then no later than 30 additional days, he shall issue a DWPA license. (d)&nbsp; If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such determination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such consequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS. &nbsp;Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD. Sec. 9. &nbsp; Restoring America&#8217;s Mineral Dominance .&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions. (b) &nbsp;The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey&#8217;s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium. (d) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on locating previously unknown deposits of critical minerals. (e) &nbsp;The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds. (f) &nbsp;The United States Trade Representative shall assess whether exploitative practices and state-assisted mineral projects abroad are unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce. (g) &nbsp;The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the national security implications of the Nation&#8217;s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action. (h) &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the quantity and inflow of minerals that are likely the product of forced labor into the United States and whether such inflows pose a threat to national security and, within 90 days of the date of this order, shall provide this assessment to the Director of the NEC. (i) &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense shall consider the needs of the United States in supplying and maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, review the legal authorities and obligations in managing the National Defense Stockpile, and take all appropriate steps to ensure that the National Defense Stockpile will provide a robust supply of critical minerals in event of future shortfall. (j) &nbsp;Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations. (k) &nbsp;The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Sec. 10. &nbsp;General Provisions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

REALIGNING THE UNITED STATES REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM,EXECUTIVE ORDER,20/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/realigning-the-united-states-refugee-admissions-program/,"Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions REALIGNING THE UNITED STATES REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM EXECUTIVE ORDER January 20, 2025 REALIGNING THE United States REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq. , and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. &nbsp;Purpose. &nbsp;Over the last 4 years, the United States has been inundated with record levels of migration, including through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). &nbsp;Cities and small towns alike, from Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio, to Whitewater, Wisconsin, have seen significant influxes of migrants.&nbsp; Even major urban centers such as New York City, Chicago, and Denver have sought Federal aid to manage the burden of new arrivals. &nbsp;Some jurisdictions, like New York and Massachusetts, have even recently declared states of emergency because of increased migration. The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees. &nbsp;This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States to ensure that public safety and national security are paramount considerations in the administration of the USRAP, and to admit only those refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate into the United States and to ensure that the United States preserves taxpayer resources for its citizens. &nbsp;It is also the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. &nbsp;I therefore direct that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP be suspended &#8212; subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section &#8212; until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order.&nbsp; This suspension shall take effect at 12:01 am eastern standard time on January 27, 2025. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order. (c)&nbsp; Notwithstanding the suspension of the USRAP imposed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit aliens to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such aliens as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. (d)&nbsp; The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.&nbsp; In all cases, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure that the State and local consultation requirements in 8&nbsp;U.S.C. 1522(a)(2) are carried out with respect to all refugees admitted to the United States. Sec. 4.&nbsp; Resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.&nbsp; Within 90 days of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit a report to the President through the Homeland Security Advisor regarding whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the USRAP would be in the interests of the United States, in light of the policies outlined in section 2 of this order.&nbsp; The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit further reports every 90 days thereafter until I determine that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States. Sec. 5. &nbsp;Revocation. &nbsp;Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs To Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration), is hereby revoked. Sec. 6. &nbsp;Severability. &nbsp;If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 7. &nbsp;General Provisions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

PROTECTING THE MEANING AND VALUE OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP,EXECUTIVE ORDER,20/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/,"Protecting The Meaning And Value Of American Citizenship &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions PROTECTING THE MEANING AND VALUE OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP EXECUTIVE ORDER January 20, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. &nbsp;Purpose. &nbsp;The privilege of United States citizenship is a priceless and profound gift.&nbsp; The Fourteenth Amendment states: &nbsp;&#8220;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&#8221;&nbsp; That provision rightly repudiated the Supreme Court of the United States&#8217;s shameful decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), which misinterpreted the Constitution as permanently excluding people of African descent from eligibility for United States citizenship solely based on their race.&nbsp; But the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.&nbsp; The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof.&#8221;&nbsp; Consistent with this understanding, the Congress has further specified through legislation that &#8220;a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; is a national and citizen of the United States at birth, 8 U.S.C. 1401, generally mirroring the Fourteenth Amendment&#8217;s text. &nbsp; Among the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States: &nbsp;(1) when that person&#8217;s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person&#8217;s birth, or (2) when that person&#8217;s mother&#8217;s presence in the United States at the time of said person&#8217;s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person&#8217;s birth. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States that no department or agency of the United States government shall issue documents recognizing United States citizenship, or accept documents issued by State, local, or other governments or authorities purporting to recognize United States citizenship, to persons: &nbsp;(1) when that person&#8217;s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person&#8217;s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person&#8217;s birth, or (2) when that person&#8217;s mother&#8217;s presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person&#8217;s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person&#8217;s birth. (b)&nbsp; Subsection (a) of this section shall apply only to persons who are born within the United States after 30 days from the date of this order. (c)&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement of other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their United States citizenship.&nbsp; Sec. 3. &nbsp;Enforcement. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments and agencies are consistent with this order, and that no officers, employees, or agents of their respective departments and agencies act, or forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order. (b)&nbsp; The heads of all executive departments and agencies shall issue public guidance within 30 days of the date of this order regarding this order&#8217;s implementation with respect to their operations and activities. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Definitions.&nbsp; As used in this order: (a) &nbsp;&#8220;Mother&#8221; means the immediate female biological progenitor.

(2)&nbsp; Immediately withdraw any rules that have been sent to&nbsp;the OFR but not published in the&nbsp; Federal Register , so that they can be reviewed and approved as described in paragraph&nbsp;1, subject to the exceptions described in&nbsp;paragraph 1.&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Consistent with applicable law and subject to the exceptions described in paragraph 1, consider postponing for 60 days from the date of this memorandum the effective date for any rules that have been published in the&nbsp; Federal Register , or any rules that have been issued in any manner but have not taken effect, for the purpose of reviewing any questions of fact, law, and policy that the rules may raise. &nbsp;During this 60-day period, where appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider opening a comment period to allow interested parties to provide comments about issues of fact, law, and policy raised by the rules postponed under this memorandum, and consider reevaluating pending petitions involving such rules. &nbsp;As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and where necessary to continue to review these questions of fact, law, and policy, consider further delaying, or publishing for notice and comment, proposed rules further delaying such rules beyond the 60-day period. (4)&nbsp; Following the postponement described in paragraph 3, no further action needs to be taken for those rules that raise no substantial questions of fact, law, or policy. &nbsp;For those rules that raise substantial questions of fact, law, or policy, agencies should notify and take further appropriate action in consultation with the OMB Director.

Purpose. The United States must grow its economy and maintain jobs for its citizens while playing a leadership role in global efforts to protect the environment. Over decades, with the help of sensible policies that do not encumber private-sector activity, the United States has simultaneously grown its economy, raised worker wages, increased energy production, reduced air and water pollution, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The United States&#8217; successful track record of advancing both economic and environmental objectives should be a model for other countries. In recent years, the United States has purported to join international agreements and initiatives that do not reflect our country&#8217;s values or our contributions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives.&nbsp; Moreover, these agreements steer American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of my Administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy. These agreements must not unduly or unfairly burden the United States. Sec. 3. Implementation. (a) The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately submit formal written notification of the United States&#8217; withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The notice shall be submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Depositary of the Agreement, attached as Appendix A. The United States will consider its withdrawal from the Agreement and any attendant obligations to be effective immediately upon this provision of notification. (b) &nbsp;The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately submit written formal notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, or any relevant party, of the United States&#8217; withdrawal from any agreement, pact, accord, or similar commitment made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. (c) &nbsp;The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, shall immediately cease or revoke any purported financial commitment made by the United States under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. (d) &nbsp;Immediately upon completion of the tasks listed in subsections (a), (b), and (c), the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury shall certify a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that describes in detail any further action required to achieve the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order. (e) &nbsp;The U.S. International Climate Finance Plan is revoked and rescinded immediately. &nbsp;The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall, within 10 days of this order, issue guidance for the rescission of all frozen funds. (f) &nbsp;Within 30 days of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Chief Executive Officer of the International Development Finance Corporation, Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, President of the Export-Import Bank, and head of any other relevant department or agency shall submit a&nbsp;report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that details their actions to revoke or rescind policies that were implemented to advance the International Climate Finance Plan. (g) &nbsp;The Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, and the head of any department or agency that plans or coordinates international energy agreements shall henceforth prioritize economic efficiency, the promotion of American prosperity, consumer choice, and fiscal restraint in all foreign engagements that concern energy policy. Sec. 4. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or any other persons.

L. 118-50, div. H) regulates &#8220;foreign adversary controlled applications,&#8221; specifically those operated by TikTok and any other subsidiary of its China-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on national security grounds. Section 2(a) of the Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, or updating certain defined foreign adversary controlled applications within the territory of the United States by providing (A) services for such distribution, maintenance, or updates by means of an online mobile application store or other marketplace; or (B) internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications. &nbsp;Section 2(g) of the Act defines &#8220;Foreign Adversary Controlled Application&#8221; to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd. or TikTok. &nbsp;Under section 2(a) of the Act, the prohibitions of the Act with respect to these entities became effective on January 19, 2025. I have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions. &nbsp;To fulfill those responsibilities, I intend to consult with my advisors, including the heads of relevant departments and agencies on the national security concerns posed by TikTok, and to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans. &nbsp;My Administration must also review sensitive intelligence related to those concerns and evaluate the sufficiency of mitigation measures TikTok has taken to date. The unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act &#8212; one day before I took office as the 47th President of the United States &#8212; interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act&#8217;s prohibitions before they take effect. &nbsp;This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns. &nbsp;Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Action . &nbsp; (a)&nbsp; I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order, to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok. &nbsp;During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act. &nbsp;In light of this direction, even after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, to the signing of this order. (b)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a). (c) &nbsp;I further order the Attorney General to issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this Executive Order. (d)&nbsp; Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act only in the Attorney General, attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive.&nbsp; The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive&#8217;s exclusive authority to enforce the Act. Sec. 3. &nbsp;General Provisions . &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Dave Chan—AFP/Getty Images Ideas By David Moscrop January 12, 2025 7:00 AM EST David Moscrop is a columnist, podcast host, and author of Too Dumb for Democracy: Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones? He lives in Ottawa. O n Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation to avoid a revolt from his Liberal lawmakers amid over a year of disastrous polling . Parliament is now suspended until March and Trudeau will stay on until the Liberals pick a new leader. But while the country is entering a brief period of limbo, one thing is all but certain. A man who has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump will become Canada’s Prime Minister. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, is on track to decisively win an election expected this Spring and bring the Trudeau era to an end. The Conservatives are up by more than 20 points in the polls, amid deep anger over the cost-of-living crisis and other issues that have recently toppled incumbents across the West. Read More: How Canada Fell Out of Love With Trudeau Should Poilievre win his expected majority in Parliament, he will have the run of the joint. Canadian Prime Ministers are famously—or infamously—powerful in such situations.&nbsp; No Canadian Prime Minister is an absolute monarch—they face modest restraints from their caucus, the courts, opposition in the House of Commons, the Senate, interest groups, and the people of Canada themselves—but in practice they can get away with an awful lot between elections. The Westminster “ whip system ” is unique for its strength and it means that Poilievre will have at least four years in which his soldiers are lined up firmly behind him—just as Trudeau once did. He’ll enjoy that power as long as he remains popular—just as Trudeau once did. Poilievre is a bare-knuckle brawler of a politician who means what he says and says what he believes to be true. He’s a lifelong conservative, a true believer, and a deep ideologue in the make and mold of the Reagan era. He’s committed to a 1980s-style tough on crime program , the sort that’s proven time and again to fail. He’s doubtless about the power of the free market and utterly committed to restraining government—cutting costs, taxes, and letting capitalism do its thing, convinced of the Gipper’s adage that government isn’t the solution, it’s the problem. In that sense, Canadians can expect Poilievre to slash taxes, regulations, and, perhaps, social programs. He hasn’t committed to keeping popular Trudeau-era social programs, including a free dental care plan and a budding prescription drug care one. The 45-year-old Poilievre has been an elected politician his entire career. But he has carefully cultivated an outsider narrative. He has a boxer’s demeanour. There are echoes of the far right in his war cries. He attacks journalists, gets the facts wrong in the service of over-the-top rhetoric, and flirts with extremists . He’s not shy about bounding into the growing fronts of the culture wars , including the pushback against trans rights. He has something of an extremely-online alt-right YouTuber about him, a kind of smarmy and self-satisfied certainty, which is as disconcerting as it is fitting for the times. But there’s more to Poilievre than just that. Since becoming Conservative Party leader, he has focused on affordability issues that are a top voter concern, courting the working class in the process. It’s a strategy that’s been a smashing success at a time when the country is indeed making its way through a protracted cost-of-living crisis driven by the lingering effects of the pandemic, high— though falling —interest rates, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and a Trudeau carbon tax . With a pocketbook-first agenda and an angry-everyman demeanour, Poilievre has managed to become the man for the moment. But Poilievre’s brash style will mean that Canada—a country with a reputation for “nice” people and nice politics—may increasingly look like the toxic partisanship seen everywhere that the Donald Trump era has exacerbated to the extreme in the U.S. For now, though, Poilievre’s discipline in focusing on economic issues has paid off. He’s been wise to show up where voters tend to be, speaking to them in ways that resonate, reflecting back the anger and frustration so many people feel as they struggle to afford groceries and rent or mortgage payments, as they worry if their jobs will remain secure and sufficient, or as they wait months to see a doctor, if they can find one . He’s an angry man , but it’s an angry time. That anger is Poilievre’s ally today, but tomorrow it could be his enemy—and the source of his downfall. If he wins and fails to get a grip on the issues Canadians care most about, he may find himself sharing Trudeau’s fate before long, as so many of his predecessors have.&nbsp; More Must-Reads from TIME Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington Meet the 2025 Women of the Year Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?

"ENDING ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION AND
RESTORING MERIT-BASED OPPORTUNITY",OTHER,21/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/,"Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ENDING ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION AND RESTORING MERIT-BASED OPPORTUNITY January 21, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose. Longstanding Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. These civil-rights protections serve as a bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all Americans. As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans. Yet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; (DEI) or &#8220;diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility&#8221; (DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation. Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex. These illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American men, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities. Yet in case after tragic case, the American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing. The Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work. I therefore order all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements. I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities. Sec. 3. Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal Government. (a) The following executive actions are hereby revoked: (i) Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations); (ii) Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce); (iii) Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity); and (iv) The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce). (b) The Federal contracting process shall be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws. Accordingly: (i) Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), is hereby revoked. For 90 days from the date of this order, Federal contractors may continue to comply with the regulatory scheme in effect on January 20, 2025. (ii) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Department of Labor shall immediately cease: (A) Promoting &#8220;diversity&#8221;; (B) Holding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;; and (C) Allowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin. (iii) In accordance with Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), the employment, procurement, and contracting practices of Federal contractors and subcontractors shall not consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin in ways that violate the Nation&#8217;s civil rights laws. (iv) The head of each agency shall include in every contract or grant award: (A) A term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government&#8217;s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and (B) A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. (c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall: (i) Review and revise, as appropriate, all Government-wide processes, directives, and guidance; (ii) Excise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and (iii) Terminate all &#8220;diversity,&#8221; &#8220;equity,&#8221; &#8220;equitable decision-making,&#8221; &#8220;equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,&#8221; &#8220;advancing equity,&#8221; and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate. Sec. 4. Encouraging the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI Discrimination and Preferences. (a) The heads of all agencies, with the assistance of the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work identified in section 2 of this order. (b) To further inform and advise me so that my Administration may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policy, the Attorney General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI. The report shall contain a proposed strategic enforcement plan identifying: (i) Key sectors of concern within each agency&#8217;s jurisdiction; (ii) The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern; (iii) A plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles (whether specifically denominated &#8220;DEI&#8221; or otherwise) that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences. As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars; (iv) Other strategies to encourage the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal civil-rights laws; (v) Litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest; and (vi) Potential regulatory action and sub-regulatory guidance. Sec. 5. Other Actions. Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly issue guidance to all State and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds, as well as all institutions of higher education that receive Federal grants or participate in the Federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., regarding the measures and practices required to comply with Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023). Sec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 7. Scope. (a) This order does not apply to lawful Federal or private-sector employment and contracting preferences for veterans of the U.S. armed forces or persons protected by the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq. (b) This order does not prevent State or local governments, Federal contractors, or Federally-funded State and local educational agencies or institutions of higher education from engaging in First Amendment-protected speech. (c) This order does not prohibit persons teaching at a Federally funded institution of higher education as part of a larger course of academic instruction from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the unlawful employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Luxon said he looked forward to working together to make the most of the opportunities that exist between them. Follow live updates of Inauguration Day in the US with RNZ's blog Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has congratulated JD Vance on being sworn in as the new vice president. Peters said he looked forward to working together to further deepen the relationship between New Zealand and the US. He added the two countries were two of the world's great, longest-running democracies. Labour leader Chris Hipkins congratulated Trump on his inauguration, saying the party wished him and the American people success. ACT leader David Seymour said the important thing for New Zealand after Trump's inauguration was the peaceful transfer of power. He takes over as deputy prime minister in May and said he had been focused on New Zealand, but the new US regime could mean changes in trade and defence. He said the decisive result and the departing leaders' commitment to graciously conceding helped avoid the kind of tensions seen after the 2020 election. The Greens said Trump's inauguration would require New Zealand to show leadership in tackling climate change. The new president's policy of abandoning the Paris Agreement would see the US join Iran, Libya and Yemen as being among the few nations not involved. Greens co-leader Chloe Swarbrick said New Zealand's prime minister had talked up working with like-minded nations, and this was an opportunity to do so. She said failing to address the climate crisis would mean more and worse weather events like the Los Angeles fires , Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding in the North Island in 2023.

Photo illustration by The New York Times; source photograph by Julia Demaree Nikhinson Listen to this article · 8:10 min Learn more Share full article 552 552 By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist Over recent decades, a computer programmer and prolific internet commenter has risen from the obscurity of forums and pseudonymous blogs to the pages of this newspaper, as a friend to Vice President JD Vance and as a person who influences many of the people who influence President Trump. Posting as Mencius Moldbug, Curtis Yarvin built a small but influential following among the more reactionary segments of the tech elite, providing them with an elaborate and conspiratorial vision of a nation under the heel of a tyrannical and suffocating liberalism, a broad group of individuals and institutions he calls “the Cathedral.” The path to national renewal, Yarvin argues, is to unravel American democracy in favor of rule by a benevolent C.E.O.-monarch drawn from a cadre of venture capitalists and corporate oligarchs. With views like these, it is not difficult to understand how Yarvin won the admiration of powerful patrons. He does little more than tell them what they want to hear. If he had been born a minor noble scrounging for influence in the court of Louis XIV, he would have been among the first to exclaim the absolute authority of the king, to tell anyone who would listen that yes, the state, it’s him. We do not have kings in the American Republic, but we do have capitalists. And in particular, we have a set of capitalists who appear to be as skeptical of liberal democracy as any monarch. They want to hear that they are the indispensable men. They want to hear that their parochial business concerns are as vital and important as the national interest. Aggrieved by the give-and-take of democratic life, they want to hear that they are under siege by the nefarious and illegitimate forces of a vast conspiracy. And hungry for the kind of status that money can’t buy, they want to hear that they deserve to rule. Yarvin affirms their fears, flatters their fantasies and gives them a language with which to express their great ambitions. Never mind that the actual substance of his ideas leaves much to be desired. Take his illuminating interview with The Times , in which he gives readers a crash course in his overall political vision. He makes a studied effort to appear as learned and erudite as possible. But linger just a little on his answers and you’ll see the extent to which they’re underproofed and overbaked. Consider his claim that “effective government” requires a strongman. He uses consumer goods as evidence: When I ask people to answer that question, I ask them to look around the room and point out everything in the room that was made by a monarchy, because these things that we call companies are actually little monarchies. You’re looking around, and you see, for example, a laptop, and that laptop was made by Apple, which is a monarchy. If Yarvin believes that Apple is a monarchy, he may not actually understand what a monarchy is. Tim Cook is not the sovereign of the Apple computing company; he serves at the pleasure of its board. Moreover, to say the laptop was “made by Apple” is to elide the extent to which product development, like any other form of high-level industrial production, is a collective and collaborative process. Your MacBook is not forged by a singular will. The idea that you can “thank monarchy” for an iPhone is ridiculous, and the idea that this could be a political prognosis is absurd.

President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,OTHER,23/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/presidents-council-of-advisors-on-science-and-technology/,"President&#039;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology January 23, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish an advisory council on science and technology, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. &nbsp;Purpose. &nbsp;The American story is one of boundless creativity and bold ambition, driven by an indomitable pioneering spirit that propels exploration and discovery. &nbsp;It is this spirit that illuminated the world with Edison&#8217;s lightbulb, carried the Wright brothers into the skies, and sent Armstrong to the moon. &nbsp;Today, a new frontier of scientific discovery lies before us, defined by transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced biotechnology. &nbsp;Breakthroughs in these fields have the potential to reshape the global balance of power, spark entirely new industries, and revolutionize the way we live and work. &nbsp;As our global competitors race to exploit these technologies, it is a national security imperative for the United States to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance. &nbsp;To secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation by empowering entrepreneurs, unleashing private-sector creativity, and reinvigorating our research institutions. At the heart of scientific progress lies the pursuit of truth. &nbsp;But this foundational principle, which has driven every major breakthrough in our history, is increasingly under threat. Today, across science, medicine, and technology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group identity above individual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense of innovative ideas, and inject politics into the heart of the scientific method. &nbsp;These agendas have not only distorted truth but have eroded public trust, undermined the integrity of research, stifled innovation, and weakened America&#8217;s competitive edge. This order establishes the President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and government to guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting a path forward for American leadership in science and technology. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Establishment. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;There is hereby established the President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).

(c) &nbsp;The APST and the Special Advisor for AI &amp; Crypto shall serve as Co-Chairs of the PCAST. &nbsp;The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice Chairs of the PCAST from among the non-Federal members of the PCAST, to support the Co-Chairs in the leadership and organization of the PCAST. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Functions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The PCAST shall advise the President on matters involving science, technology, education, and innovation policy. &nbsp;The Council shall also provide the President with scientific and technical information that is needed to inform public policy relating to the American economy, the American worker, national and homeland security, and other topics. (b) &nbsp;The PCAST shall meet regularly and shall: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond to requests from the President or the Co-Chairs for information, analysis, evaluation, or advice; (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;solicit information and ideas from a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community; the private sector; universities; national laboratories; State, local, and Tribal governments; foundations; and nonprofit organizations; (iii) &nbsp;serve as the advisory committee identified in section 101(b) of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-194), as amended (15 U.S.C. 5511(b)), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the President&#8217;s Innovation and Technology Advisory Committee; and (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serve as the advisory panel identified in section 4 of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (Public Law 108-153), as amended (15 U.S.C. 7503), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel. (c) &nbsp;The PCAST shall provide advice from the non-Federal sector to the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in response to requests from the NSTC. Sec. 4. &nbsp;Administration. &nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the PCAST with information concerning scientific and technological matters when requested by the PCAST Co-Chairs and as required for the purpose of carrying out the PCAST&#8217;s functions. (b) &nbsp;In consultation with the Co-Chairs, the PCAST is authorized to create standing subcommittees and ad hoc groups, including technical advisory groups, to assist the PCAST and provide preliminary information directly to the PCAST. (c) &nbsp;In order to allow the PCAST to provide advice and analysis regarding classified matters, the Co-Chairs may request that members of the PCAST, its standing subcommittees, or ad hoc groups who do not hold a current clearance for access to classified information receive security clearance and access determinations pursuant to Executive Order 12968 of August 2, 1995 (Access to Classified Information), as amended, or any successor order. (d) &nbsp;The Department of Energy shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the PCAST may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations.

App.), may apply to the PCAST, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of Energy, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services.

(b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

The President is wasting no time delivering on the promises he made to the American people. The President signed more executive orders on his first day in office than any other president in history. Within the first 100 hours of his second administration, President Trump taken hundreds of executive actions to secure the border, deport criminal illegal immigrants, unleash American prosperity, lower costs, increase government transparency, and reinstitute merit-based hiring in the federal government. The President has already secured over $1 trillion in historic new investments . We’re witnessing the Trump Effect: President Trump is securing historic investments just days after being sworn in. President Trump secured $500 billion in private sector investment for the largest AI infrastructure project in history, with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman all stating that it would not have been possible if not for President Trump’s election victory and leadership. Saudi Arabia “ wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years .” Stellantis announced it will restart an assembly plant in Illinois and build the new Dodge Durango in Detroit.

Fox News : “Information obtained by Fox News Digital, shows that between midnight Jan. 21 and 9 a.m. Jan 22, a 33-hour period, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested more than 460 illegal immigrants that include criminal histories of sexual assault, robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, drugs and weapons offenses, resisting arrest and domestic violence.” Breitbart News : “President Donald Trump’s administration arrested 538 illegal aliens on Thursday, ranging from child predators to gang members and a suspected terrorist.” The Trump Administration immediately shut down the CBP One app, which “ paroled ” over 1 million illegal immigrants. Deportation flights have already started and the military is assisting with the effort. The Department of Homeland Security reinstated official use of the term “illegal alien” over “undocumented noncitizen,” and the DOJ announced it would be taking action against lawless sanctuary city policies. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to designate the cartels as terrorist organizations. Common sense has been restored to the government. President Trump signed a series of executive orders ensuring the elimination of discriminatory DEI practices and ensuring merit-based hiring. DEI staff are being placed on leave. The Federal Aviation Administration must now return to merit-based hiring. President Trump ended an affirmative action mandate in federal government hiring. President Trump signed an executive order affirming the reality that there are only two sexes. The State Department issued guidance that embassies should only be flying the American flag, and not any activist flags.

The State Department subsequently ordered workers to return to working in the office. President Donald Trump is unleashing American energy. President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to unlock America’s full energy potential and bring down costs for American families. President Trump rescinded every one of Joe Biden’s industry-killing, pro-China, and anti-American energy regulations , empowering consumer choice in vehicles, showerheads, toilets, washing machines, lightbulbs , and dishwashers. President Trump withdrew the United States from the disastrous Paris Climate Agreement that unfairly ripped off our country. President Trump paused all new federal leasing and permitting for massive wind farms that degrade our natural landscapes and fail to serve American energy consumers. President Trump reversed the burdensome regulations that impeded Alaska’s ability to develop its vast natural resources. President Trump terminated Biden’s harmful electric vehicle mandate . &nbsp; &nbsp; These opening few days can be summarized as Promises Made, Promises Kept: &nbsp; President Donald Trump said he would declassify the JFK Files. He did . President Donald Trump said he would end the EV mandate. He did . President Donald Trump said he would have the backs of the brave men and women in law enforcement. He did just that by pardoning two Washington D.C. Police officers that were unjustly prosecuted. The Metropolitan Police Department thanked President Trump for the pardon. President Donald Trump said he would use the military to secure the border. The Pentagon is deploying troops to the border and the Coast Guard is surging assets to the Gulf of America.

He reiterated that support on day one by directing his agencies to investigate unfair trade and its impact on domestic manufacturing.” American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers President and CEO Chet Thompson : “President Trump promised to end gas car bans and vehicle mandates on Day 1 of his new administration, and we are pleased to see that work already underway. Thank you, President Trump.” American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers : “Americans sent a clear message at the ballot box, and President Trump is answering the call on Day 1. U.S. energy dominance will drive our nation’s economic and security agenda. This is a new day for American energy, and we applaud President Trump for moving swiftly to chart a new path where U.S. oil and natural gas are embraced, not restricted.&#8221; Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz : “Trump&#8217;s two-fold approach of boosting oil and gas production and repealing the Biden administration&#8217;s green energy mandates will make American energy cheaper, reliable and more efficient.” Mortgage Bankers Association President and CEO Bob Broeksmit : “President Trump campaigned on lowering costs for Americans, and we appreciate housing supply and affordability being included in an executive order on this issue. We support efforts to cut unnecessary regulatory red tape and to pursue federal housing program enhancements that make renting and homeownership more attainable and sustainable.” Professional Trucking Association Group : “President Trump&#8217;s decision to freeze regulations and curtail bureaucratic overreach is commendable. This is precisely what America needs: reduced government interference and increased freedom for small trucking businesses and entrepreneurs to flourish.” NetChoice CEO Steve DelBianco : “Upon returning to office, President Trump showed that America is ready to lead in tech and innovation again. By repealing Biden’s restrictive rules on energy production and AI development, the president is steering America to remain dominant in creating the best technology in the world.” United Against Nuclear Iran Chairman Governor Jeb Bush and CEO Ambassador Mark Wallace : “We applaud President Trump for his decision today to redesignate the Houthis as an FTO. UANI in its recommended action plan for the Trump administration’s first 100 days suggested that the president redesignate the Houthis as an FTO. This will now provide the U.S. government additional authorities to hold the Houthis accountable for their threats to international commerce and U.S. allies and partners.” News Administration Issues Contact Visit The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 X Instagram Facebook WH.GOV Copyright Privacy",9648

Credit: New York Times Curtis Yarvin Democracy Democratic Party Donald Trump Liberalism Monarchy Politics The New York Times US Latest from the Newsroom 10:00 JD Vance&#8217;s Munich speech was full of contradictions 10:00 Le discours de JD Vance à Munich était plein de contradictions 10:00 JD Vance&#8217;s Munich speech was full of contradictions January 19, 2025 - 6:30pm Today marks the eve of Donald Trump’s second inauguration. His election victory in November sparked a cultural shift, plunging the American Left into an identity crisis . “Now is the time of monsters,” New York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein wrote last week, quoting Gramsci. Referring to Trump’s return to office, as well as the AI boom, climate change, and falling global fertility rates, he added: “To look at any of these stories in isolation is to miss what they collectively represent: the unsteady, unpredictable emergence of a different world.” Klein’s column presents a contradiction within the broader Left-wing zeitgeist. Progressives widely acknowledge that in practice — in terms of their ability to solve problems, influence institutions and win elections — Democrats have lost ground. But in theory, according to this school of thought, the party remains in the moral right on every issue. Enter Curtis Yarvin , a monarchist, political theorist, and influencer of the Online Right. As the New York Times interview with him published this weekend puts it, “while Yarvin himself may still be obscure, his ideas are not.” The thinker’s conversation with the NYT ’s David Marchese is in fact a masterclass in a very specific kind of persuasion: disenchantment. When asked who he considers “enlightened” by his political theory, Yarvin replies: “Fully enlightened for me means fully disenchanted. When a person who lives within the progressive bubble of the current year looks at the Right or even the new Right, what’s hardest to see is that what’s really shared is not a positive belief but an absence of belief.” If support for Trump is any sign, significant fractions of the tech industry , online media , and cultural influencers are increasingly “fully disenchanted”. Yarvin challenges the political and historical myths of the Left from a sympathetic lens. He treads across progressive moral taboos with help from Marchese, who brings up some of the writer’s most contentious past blog posts about white nationalism and race. One of Yarvin’s more controversial beliefs is that the US should be ruled by monarchy — a single individual with absolute power — rather than democracy or oligarchy. The reason Yarvin cites for preferring this system is that “having an effective government and an efficient government is better for people’s lives.” He believes that the government can only be as productive as a private company by becoming governed like a private company, citing Apple as an example of a “monarchy” under his definition. This idea comes at a time when a cottage industry of Left-wing think tanks , journalists , and policymakers has formed around the concept of “state capacity” — creating a system that can execute on large government projects. As the interview progresses, Marchese makes increasingly emotional outbursts about the aforementioned taboos: “I can’t believe I’m saying this”, “I can’t believe I’m arguing this”, “You call it cartoonish, I call it very morally clear.” Gaetano Mosca, an Italian political theorist often quoted by Yarvin, argues that these unquestioned statements are used to reinforce elite power. Mosca defines a “political formula” as “abstract principles through which the political elite justifies its own power, building around it a moral and legal structure”. Rather than being evidenced factual claims, these are slogans chanted to show power and obedience to power. While the liberal-Left contingent long dominant within the Democratic Party has become largely disenchanted by these slogans, it remains invested in the political system which gave rise to them. Towards the end of the interview, Marchese expresses that he is unconvinced “why blowing up democracy, rather than trying to make it better, would somehow lead to better lives for people who are struggling the most”. Yarvin, for his part, argues that “people equate democracy with good government”, an error which weds them to the failing system in place. After November’s defeat, Democrats must choose one of two desires: the desire to repeat the moral shibboleths of the 2010s, or the desire to win. If they choose the former, they will continue to lose ground in public opinion, government, and cultural institutions. If they choose the latter, they might have to consider Yarvin’s perspective in order to rebuild state capacity. The Democrats&#8217; road back to power, and towards understanding what went wrong before, will require a reckoning with disenchantment.

Such modern businesses operate on investment open to everybody with the capital to invest, for which a board of directors is responsible and which the business assumes a limited liability. Everything in business is ruled by contracts, dividends and exchange. If a business fails it can liquidate and close shop, with most people walking away from it relatively unharmed. Monarchy on the other hand is intrinsically linked to the Divine, is exclusive to those who the monarch deems worthy of being in its court and assumes complete liability. Monarchies are ruled by duties, honour and oaths over subjects for who circumstance of birth (not investment) puts on them an obligation where complete liability is assumed and for which, if it fails, great harm usually affects everybody involved. Most importantly the distinction between an investor and a subject is that the board of directors are not responsible for the investor themselves only their investment, a monarch is responsible for their subjects which includes every aspect of their life including their wealth. Modern people &#8211; with their secular Rousseauian social contract view of the world &#8211; can barely even grasp concepts like duty or oaths that make monarchies possible. Which is why countries that do have monarchies in modern times are really just autocrats or glorified celebrities. What Curtis is essentially proposing, probably without even realizing it, is much closer to modern China&#8217;s method of governance in which a single party of &#8216;directors&#8217; rule a population that has been reduced to mere numbers on a spreadsheet and allotted a kind of social credit rating based on their &#8216;investment&#8217; into the system. Such a similar outcome would result from Curtis&#8217; &#8216;neo-monarchism&#8217;, it would essentially be rule by a bank not a monarch. Somehow, to me, governance by a bank with its petty tyranny is more egregious and tortuous than the violent maliciousness of a dictator. I&#8217;d rather a bullet to the head than a life-long barrage of credit ratings, brown envelopes and cold calls. 1 0 Reply Rowan Thomas 25 days ago Reply to&nbsp; Allan You had me on board until your last hyperbolic sentence. Really? You’d rather a bullet to the head? 0 0 Reply Allan 23 days ago Reply to&nbsp; Rowan Thomas In principle? Yes. Obviously probably be far too much of a coward to choose death in reality, but anybody who has read Kafka knows that &#8211; at least intellectually &#8211; a swift death is preferable to a life long struggle against a bureaucratic machine. Or, as C.S. Lewis said, it is better to be ruled by robber barons than moral busybodies. I&#8217;m afraid you took the hyperbole a bit too seriously. Many proclaim it is &#8216;better to die standing than live on your knees&#8217;, but most bend the knee anyway. 1 0 Reply Om Ar 26 days ago This article says nothing and fails to give the reader a context for or overview of Curtis Yarvin’s ideas.

This is the tragedy. 0 0 Reply T Bone 26 days ago I don&#8217;t think the answer is increasing the volume of abstract jargon. The true answer lies in the words of the great sage, John Robin Biden when he read a bunch of stuff off the teleprompter for the final time. That&#8217;s a fact, Jack not hyperbole. 0 0 Reply Richard Littlewood 26 days ago Very interesting. A rare insight into the mind of a progressive liberal. And oh what a mess. What will all the progressive liberals have to say as the Far Left tide goes out? Something like this article. It will be self-pitying and pointless. Please Unherd spare us from anymore of this. 0 0 Reply Claire D 26 days ago Yarvin. Treated like some seer or prophet. IMHO Yarvin is just some striking windbag. Subtract the &#8216;Monachy&#8217; routine from his patter and you just have a family standard neo lib. There is a populist project or an elite project. The first says it is an instrument of the people, but has other secret masters. The latter doesn&#8217;t even pretend to work for the people. In the absence of a democratic revolution in which the regime is dismantled and returned to health by the people Trump is the best of a bad bunch 0 0 Reply Penny Rose 26 days ago So benign dictatorship is best? I thought that idea was exploded a long time As Juvenal said 2000 years ago &#8216;quis custodiet ipsos custodes&#8217;. 0 0 Reply J Bryant 26 days ago Sadly, Yarvin is too verbose to be an effective prophet. He&#8217;ll need a transcriber and editor. 0 0 Reply Rob N 26 days ago We never chose democracy because it&#8217;s a good system of governance but because it shouldn&#8217;t be a terrible one. Dictatorship could be fantastic but more likely, esp in the medium term, it will be appalling. Most people would, reasonably, prefer mediocrity to the risk of Terror. Will our Democracy stay mediocre? Not convinced. 0 0 Reply Hugh Bryant 25 days ago Reply to&nbsp; Rob N The UK isn&#8217;t a democracy.

Don&#8217;t think so. 0 0 Reply Russell Sharpe 25 days ago Reply to&nbsp; Hugh Bryant The point of democracy is not to ensure a government with popular support. That almost never happens. It is to be able to remove a government which is widely disliked. 0 0 Reply Jim Veenbaas 26 days ago What’s that saying? Democracy is a flawed system; just a lot less flawed than anything else.. 0 0 Reply Andrew Vanbarner 26 days ago The liberal left does not dominate the Democrat party; the progressive left does. Progressive ideas are fatuous, destructive, and predictably result in terrible outcomes. &#8220;Defunding&#8221; the police and &#8220;de-prosecuting&#8221; crimes led to rising crime rates. &#8220;Ending fossil fuels&#8221; led to soaring costs for groceries and utilities. Open borders led to a refugee crisis. Massive amounts of debt financed spending also led to massive levels of inflation, with very little to show for it all. Democrats should return to the party they were &#8211; the party of labor, civil rights and liberties, and urban affairs. That would resonate with voters. Six figure electric cars and homeless encampments do not. Currently they&#8217;re the party of campus radicals, their kookier professors, and others who think socialism is a fine idea. As it turns out, it isn&#8217;t, and things like wildfires, terrorist attacks, crime, and basic economics will often appear, reminding everyone that sensible, responsible, competent governance shouldn&#8217;t be thrown away in order to somehow enact a state sponsored utopia. 0 0 Reply leonard o'reilly 26 days ago Disenchantment. I don’t know why anyone listens to a word Moldbug says. He is a bafflegab provacateur. ”The [ progressive’s ] road back to power……will require a reckoning with disenchantment.” What it will require is a reckoning with progressivism.

Hahahha. 0 0 Reply Carlos Danger 26 days ago No one who actually does anything cares a whit about the yammerings of Curtis Yarvin. He&#8217;s nonsensical. 0 0 Reply Su Mac 26 days ago Monday morning newsroom on the day of a new era is a vague article which says little and doesn&#8217;t clearly make whatever point it has. &#8220;While the liberal-Left contingent long dominant within the Democratic Party has become largely disenchanted by these slogans,&#8230;&#8221; is the 3rd repeat of this without defining what are the slogans the writer is talking about. I think the summary is the progressive Left still believe they are right about everything even though they don&#8217;t know what to believe anymore. UnHerd need to do better! 0 0 Reply laurence scaduto 25 days ago Reply to&nbsp; Su Mac I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what exactly the various windbags mean when they say &#8216;disenchantment&#8217;. 0 0 Reply Hugh Bryant 26 days ago Oh dear. How academics love to over-complicate. Under the Clintons the Democratic Party switched its allegiance from the labor unions to Wall Street. Soros became the largest donor, closely followed by Larry Fink of BlackRock and, in 2020, by the fraudster Bankman-Fried. That simple fact explains what has happened &#8211; the open border, rampant inflation, the Floyd riots &#8230; All of it. Bankers like Soros and Fink thrive on chaos and the profligacy of big government. Productive people like Musk and every small business owner need small government and stability. It will take the Democrats at least a generation to get back to their roots. I suspect the Labour Party will be gone after the next UK election, and for the same reasons. 0 0 Reply Nathan Sapio 25 days ago Every thought presented in this piece is pathological, all the way down&#8230; 0 0 Reply Jamie 25 days ago Just drivel.

Hope she told him to F*@# orf afterwards. 0 0 Reply Lancashire Lad 26 days ago The world view of the progressive left has been shown to be morally and politically bankrupt. It&#8217;s been a long time coming. The alternative view isn&#8217;t extremist, simply based upon reality. It makes no difference if so-called &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; on the left make a revisionist case, their mindset is inextricably woven into the failed narrative the West has suffered from these past three decades. Yep, we got complacent&#8230; and forgot that &#8220;the price of freedom is eternal vigilance&#8221;. Time to regroup. The breathing space afforded by Trump&#8217;s victory needs to be used to inhale the oxygen of freedom once again.

Politics Conservative Canadian PM hopeful Pierre Poilievre vows US will be &#8216;hit hard&#8217; over Trump&#8217;s tariffs if he&#8217;s elected to replace Trudeau By Chris Harris Published Jan. 25, 2025, 4:57 p.m. ET Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre has been compared to President Trump. AFP via Getty Images The leader of Canada’s Conservative Party indicated this week that America would be &#8220;hit hard&#8221; in retaliation over President Trump&#8217;s impending tariffs if he&#8217;s elected the country&#8217;s next prime minister. &#8220;We&#8217;re both going to lose as Americans and Canadians if we get in a trade war,&#8221; Pierre Poilievre told CTV News Atlantic Friday, the first time he&#8217;s outlined his agenda. &#8220;We can buy elsewhere to maximize the impact on Americans and minimize the impact on Canadians.&#8221; When asked if he would seek a &#8220;dollar for dollar&#8221; punishment for Trump&#8217;s looming 25% tariffs, the pol heavily favored to replace embattled PM Justin Trudeau did not hold back. &#8220;I would say so. It has to hit hard. We have to be very pinpoint and surgical,&#8221; Poilievre, 45, said. Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre has been compared to President Trump.

Poilievre has drawn comparisons to Trump, 78, with Trudeau even snarking last year that the firebrand Conservative aims to &#8220;make Canada great again.&#8221; Trump has threatened to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs as soon as Feb. 1. Bloomberg via Getty Images &#8220;We have freer trade now with the Americans than ourselves,&#8221; Poilievre told CTV. &#8220;We have to knock down those barriers. If [America is] going to be an unreliable trade partner, we&#8217;ve got to find ways to sell more to ourselves and the world.&#8221; Poilievre was first elected to Canada&#8217;s Parliament in 2004 when former Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#8217;s Conservative government was in power. His popularity skyrocketed after he was elected the party&#8217;s leader in early 2022 and backed the &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; truck drivers who had descended upon Ottawa in protest of the country&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine mandates . Poilievre previously promised that, if elected, he would carry out &#8220;the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history&#8221; and &#8220;take back control of our border, take back control of immigration, take back control of spending, deficits and inflation.&#8221; Trudeau, 53, resigned earlier this month after nearly a decade in office amid mounting calls for him to step down and “internal battles” within his Liberal Party. He plans to stay in his post until the ruling lefty party chooses a replacement.

Restoring America’s Fighting Force,EXECUTIVE ORDER,27/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-americas-fighting-force/,"Restoring America&#039;s Fighting Force &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Restoring America&#8217;s Fighting Force EXECUTIVE ORDER January 27, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose . As Chief Executive and as Commander in Chief, I am committed to meritocracy and to the elimination of race-based and sex-based discrimination within the Armed Forces of the United States. No individual or group within our Armed Forces should be preferred or disadvantaged on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, color, or creed. Unfortunately, in recent years civilian and uniformed leadership alike have implemented Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and their attendant race and sex preferences within the Armed Forces. &nbsp;These actions undermine leadership, merit, and unit cohesion, thereby eroding lethality and force readiness.&nbsp; They also violate Americans&#8217; consciences by engaging in invidious race and sex discrimination. Sec. 2. Policy . It is the policy of my Administration that the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security with regard to the United States Coast Guard (USCG), and every element of the Armed Forces should operate free from any preference based on race or sex. Sec. 3. Definitions . (a) A &#8220;DEI office&#8221; means an office, division, job, or other unit of an institution established for the purpose of: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;influencing hiring or employment practices at the institution with respect to race, sex, color, or ethnicity, other than through the use of color-blind and sex-neutral hiring processes; or (ii) &nbsp;promoting differential treatment of or providing special benefits to individuals on the basis of race, sex, color, or ethnicity. (b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;gender ideology&#8221; has the meaning given to that term in section 2(f) of the Executive Order of January 20, 2025, (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government). (c) &nbsp;The term &#8220;divisive concepts&#8221; has the meaning given to that term in section 2(a) of Executive Order 13950 of September 22, 2020 (Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping). Sec. 4. Abolishing the DEI Bureaucracy . The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall abolish every DEI office within the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security with regard to the USCG, respectively, including any vestiges of DEI offices, such as sub-offices, programs, elements, or initiatives established to promote a race-based preferences system that subverts meritocracy, perpetuates unconstitutional discrimination, and promotes divisive concepts or gender ideology. Sec. 5. Department of Defense Internal Review . The Secretary of Defense shall conduct an internal review that documents actions taken in pursuit of DEI initiatives, including all instances of race and sex discrimination and activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system. The report shall be delivered to the Secretary of Defense within 90 days of the date of this order. Sec. 6. Protecting American Values. (a) The Department of Defense and the Armed Forces, including any educational institution operated or controlled thereby, are prohibited from promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;divisive concepts,&#8221; as defined in section 3(c) of this order, and &#8220;race or sex stereotyping,&#8221; or &#8220;race or sex scapegoating&#8221; as both terms are defined in section 2 of Executive Order 13950, as amended; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;that America&#8217;s founding documents are racist or sexist; and (iii) &nbsp;&#8220;gender ideology,&#8221; as defined in section 3(b) of this order. (b) &nbsp;The Department of Defense and the Armed Forces shall not hire employees, contractors, or consultants to teach the theories set forth in subsection (a) of this section. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall carefully review the leadership, curriculum, and instructors of the United States Service Academies and other defense academic institutions associated with their respective Departments to ensure alignment with this order. &nbsp;In addition, these institutions shall be required to teach that America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history. Sec. 7. Implementation . (a) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue detailed guidance for the implementation of this order to their respective departments within 30 days of the date of this order. (b) &nbsp;Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy documenting the progress of their respective Departments in implementing this order, and any recommendations for action to fulfill the objectives of this order. Sec. 8. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 9. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose and Policy . On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense mandated that all service members receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The Secretary of Defense later rescinded the mandate on January 10, 2023. The vaccine mandate was an unfair, overbroad, and completely unnecessary burden on our service members. Further, the military unjustly discharged those who refused the vaccine, regardless of the years of service given to our Nation, after failing to grant many of them an exemption that they should have received. Federal Government redress of any wrongful dismissals is overdue. Sec. 2. Redress . Consistent with the policies announced in section 1 of this order , the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, shall take all necessary action permitted by law to: (a)&nbsp; make reinstatement available to all members of the military (active and reserve) who were discharged solely for refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and who request to be reinstated; (b)&nbsp; enable those service members reinstated under this section to revert to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments, or compensation; and (c)&nbsp; allow any service members who provide a written and sworn attestation that they voluntarily left the service or allowed their service to lapse according to appropriate procedures, rather than be vaccinated under the vaccine mandate, to return to service with no impact on their service status, rank, or pay. Sec. 3. &nbsp;Additional Agency Responsibilities . &nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order precludes disciplinary or administrative action for conduct that is proscribed by chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code (Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. 801-946a). (b) &nbsp;Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall report to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs on their progress in implementing this order. Sec. 4. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 5. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

The Iron Dome for America,EXECUTIVE ORDER,27/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/,"The Iron Dome for America &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions The Iron Dome for America EXECUTIVE ORDER January 27, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including my authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose. The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United States. President Ronald Reagan endeavored to build an effective defense against nuclear attacks, and while this program resulted in many technological advances, it was canceled before its goal could be realized. And since the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and initiated development of limited homeland missile defense, official United States homeland missile defense policy has remained only to stay ahead of rogue-nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile launches. Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities. Sec. 2. Policy. To further the goal of peace through strength, it is the policy of the United States that: (a) The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield; (b) The United States will deter &#8212; and defend its citizens and critical infrastructure against &#8212; any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland; and (c) The United States will guarantee its secure second-strike capability. Sec . 3. Implementation. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall: (a) Submit to the President a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield. The architecture shall include, at a minimum, plans for: (i) Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries; (ii) Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer; (iii) Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept; (iv) Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack; (v) Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture; (vi) Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase; (vii) Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features; and (viii) Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks; (b) Review relevant authorities and organization of the Department of Defense to develop and deploy capabilities at the necessary speed to implement this directive; (c) Jointly with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, submit to the President a plan to fund this directive, allowing sufficient time for consideration by the President before finalization of the Fiscal Year 2026 Budget; and (d) In cooperation with United States Strategic Command and United States Northern Command, submit to the President: (i) An updated assessment of the strategic missile threat to the Homeland; and (ii) A prioritized set of locations to progressively defend against a countervalue attack by nuclear adversaries. Sec. 4. Allied and Theater Missile Defense Review. The United States continues to cooperate on missile defense with its allies and partners to aid in the defense of ally populations and troops and of forward-deployed United States troops. Following the submission to the President of the next-generation missile defense reference architecture under section 3(a) of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall direct a review of theater missile defense posture and initiatives to identify ways in which the United States and its allies and partners can: (a) Increase bilateral and multilateral cooperation on missile defense technology development, capabilities, and operations; (b) Improve theater missile defenses of forward-deployed United States troops and allied territories, troops, and populations; and (c) Increase and accelerate the provision of United States missile defense capabilities to allies and partners. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,EXECUTIVE ORDER,27/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/,"Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness EXECUTIVE ORDER January 27, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, and to ensure the readiness and effectiveness of our Armed Forces, it is hereby ordered: Section 1.&nbsp; Purpose.&nbsp; The United States military has a clear mission: &nbsp; to protect the American people and our homeland as the world&#8217;s most lethal and effective fighting force. &nbsp;Success in this existential mission requires a singular focus on developing the requisite warrior ethos, and the pursuit of military excellence cannot be diluted to accommodate political agendas or other ideologies harmful to unit cohesion.&nbsp; Recently, however, the Armed Forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists unconcerned with the requirements of military service like physical and mental health, selflessness, and unit cohesion.&nbsp; Longstanding Department of Defense (DoD) policy (DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6130.03) provides that it is the policy of the DoD to ensure that service members are &#8220;[f]ree of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalization.&#8221;&nbsp; As a result, many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty, from conditions that require substantial medication or medical treatment to bipolar and related disorders, eating disorders, suicidality, and prior psychiatric hospitalization. Consistent with the military mission and longstanding DoD policy, expressing a false &#8220;gender identity&#8221; divergent from an individual&#8217;s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service. &nbsp;Beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual&#8217;s sex conflicts with a soldier&#8217;s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one&#8217;s personal life.&nbsp; A man&#8217;s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.&nbsp; For the sake of our Nation and the patriotic Americans who volunteer to serve it, military service must be reserved for those mentally and physically fit for duty. &nbsp;The Armed Forces must adhere to high mental and physical health standards to ensure our military can deploy, fight, and win, including in austere conditions and without the benefit of routine medical treatment or special provisions. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity .&nbsp; This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.&nbsp; This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual&#8217;s sex. Sec. 3.&nbsp; Definitions.&nbsp; The definitions in the Executive Order of January 20, 2025 (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government ) shall apply to this order. Sec. 4.&nbsp; Implementation.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) shall update DoDI 6130.03 Volume 1 (Medical Standards for Military Service: Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction (May 6, 2018), Incorporating Change 5 of May 28, 2024) and DoDI 6130.03 Volume 2 (Medical Standards for Military Service: Retention (September 4, 2020), Incorporating Change 1 of June 6, 2022) to reflect the purpose and policy of this Order. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary shall promptly issue directives for DoD to end invented and identification-based pronoun usage to best achieve the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. (c)&nbsp; Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;identify all additional steps and issue guidance necessary to fully implement this order ; and&nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;submit to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs a report that summarizes these steps. (d)&nbsp; Absent extraordinary operational necessity, the Armed Forces shall neither allow males to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for females , nor allow females to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for males. (e)&nbsp; Within 30 days of the issuance of the respective updates, directives, and guidance under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, with respect to the Coast Guard, issue updates, directives, and guidance consistent with the updates, directives, and guidance issued under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Sec. 5.&nbsp; Implementing the Revocation of Executive Order 14004 .&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Pursuant to the Executive Order of January 20, 2025 (Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions), Executive Order 14004 of January 25, 2021 (Enabling All Qualified Americans To Serve Their Country in Uniform), has been revoked.&nbsp; Accordingly, all policies, directives, and guidance issued pursuant to Executive Order 14004 shall be rescinded to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this order.&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; The Secretary and, with respect to the Coast Guard, the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all necessary steps to implement the revocations described in subsection (a) of this section and ensure that all military departments and services fully comply with the provisions of this order. Sec. 6.&nbsp; Severability.&nbsp; If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM CHEMICAL AND SURGICAL MUTILATION,EXECUTIVE ORDER,28/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/,"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM CHEMICAL AND SURGICAL MUTILATION EXECUTIVE ORDER January 28, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Policy and Purpose . Across the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child&#8217;s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions. This dangerous trend will be a stain on our Nation&#8217;s history, and it must end. Countless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding. &nbsp;Moreover, these vulnerable youths&#8217; medical bills may rise throughout their lifetimes, as they are often trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization. Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called &#8220;transition&#8221; of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures. Sec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: (a) &nbsp;The term &#8220;child&#8221; or &#8220;children&#8221; means an individual or individuals under 19 years of age. (b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;pediatric&#8221; means relating to the medical care of a child. (c) The phrase &#8220;chemical and surgical mutilation&#8221; means the use of puberty blockers, including GnRH agonists and other interventions, to delay the onset or progression of normally timed puberty in an individual who does not identify as his or her sex; the use of sex hormones, such as androgen blockers, estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone, to align an individual&#8217;s physical appearance with an identity that differs from his or her sex; and surgical procedures that attempt to transform an individual&#8217;s physical appearance to align with an identity that differs from his or her sex or that attempt to alter or remove an individual&#8217;s sexual organs to minimize or destroy their natural biological functions. This phrase sometimes is referred to as &#8220;gender affirming care.&#8221; Sec. 3. Ending Reliance on Junk Science. (a) The blatant harm done to children by chemical and surgical mutilation cloaks itself in medical necessity, spurred by guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which lacks scientific integrity. In light of the scientific concerns with the WPATH guidance: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;agencies shall rescind or amend all policies that rely on WPATH guidance, including WPATH&#8217;s &#8220;Standards of Care Version 8&#8221;; and&nbsp; (ii) within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall publish a review of the existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of HHS, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall use all available methods to increase the quality of data to guide practices for improving the health of minors with gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion, or who otherwise seek chemical or surgical mutilation. Sec. 4. Defunding Chemical and Surgical Mutilation . The head of each executive department or agency (agency) that provides research or education grants to medical institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, shall, consistent with applicable law and in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children. Sec. 5. Additional Directives to the Secretary of HHS. (a) The Secretary of HHS shall, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children, including regulatory and sub-regulatory actions, which may involve the following laws, programs, issues, or documents: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare or Medicaid conditions of participation or conditions for coverage; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;clinical-abuse or inappropriate-use assessments relevant to State Medicaid programs; (iii) &nbsp;mandatory drug use reviews; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality, safety, and oversight memoranda; (vi) &nbsp;&nbsp;essential health benefits requirements; and (vii) the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and other federally funded manuals, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. (b) The Secretary of HHS shall promptly withdraw HHS&#8217;s March 2, 2022, guidance document titled &#8220;HHS Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming Care, Civil Rights and Patient Privacy&#8221; and, in consultation with the Attorney General, issue new guidance protecting whistleblowers who take action related to ensuring compliance with this order. Sec. 6. TRICARE . The Department of Defense provides health insurance, through TRICARE, to nearly 2 million individuals under the age of 18. As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Defense shall commence a rulemaking or sub-regulatory action to exclude chemical and surgical mutilation of children from TRICARE coverage and amend the TRICARE provider handbook to exclude chemical and surgical mutilation of children. Sec. 7. Requirements for Insurance Carriers. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall: (a) include provisions in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and Postal Service Health Benefits (PSHB) programs call letter for the 2026 Plan Year specifying that eligible carriers, including the Foreign Service Benefit Plan, will exclude coverage for pediatric transgender surgeries or hormone treatments; and (b) &nbsp;negotiate to obtain appropriate corresponding reductions in FEHB and PSHB premiums. Sec. 8. Directives to the Department of Justice . The Attorney General shall: (a) review Department of Justice enforcement of section 116 of title 18, United States Code, and prioritize enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation; (b) convene States&#8217; Attorneys General and other law enforcement officers to coordinate the enforcement of laws against female genital mutilation across all American States and Territories; (c) prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end deception of consumers, fraud, and violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by any entity that may be misleading the public about long-term side effects of chemical and surgical mutilation; (d) &nbsp;in consultation with the Congress, work to draft, propose, and promote legislation to enact a private right of action for children and the parents of children whose healthy body parts have been damaged by medical professionals practicing chemical and surgical mutilation, which should include a lengthy statute of limitations; and (e) prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end child-abusive practices by so-called sanctuary States that facilitate stripping custody from parents who support the healthy development of their own children, including by considering the application of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and recognized constitutional rights. Sec. 9. Enforcing Adequate Progress. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of agencies with responsibilities under this order shall submit a single, combined report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, detailing progress in implementing this order and a timeline for future action. The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall regularly convene the heads of agencies with responsibilities under this order (or their designees) to coordinate and prepare for this submission. Sec. 10. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of any of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 11. General Provisions.

Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,EXECUTIVE ORDER,29/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/,"Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling EXECUTIVE ORDER January 29, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose and Policy. Parents trust America&#8217;s schools to provide their children with a rigorous education and to instill a patriotic admiration for our incredible Nation and the values for which we stand. In recent years, however, parents have witnessed schools indoctrinate their children in radical, anti-American ideologies while deliberately blocking parental oversight. Such an environment operates as an echo chamber, in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without question or critical examination. In many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics. In other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed. These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity. Imprinting anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our Nation&#8217;s children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority. For example, steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to private spaces designated for females may contravene Federal laws that protect parental rights, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), and sex-based equality and opportunity, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). Similarly, demanding acquiescence to &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; or &#8220;unconscious bias,&#8221; actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity. My Administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of Federal funds providing K-12 education comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental rights, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.; Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h. Sec. 2. Definitions. As used herein: (a) The definitions in the Executive Order &#8220;Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government&#8221; (January 20, 2025) shall apply to this order. (b) &#8220;Discriminatory equity ideology&#8221; means an ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of immoral generalizations, including that: (i) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; (ii) An individual, by virtue of the individual&#8217;s race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (iii) An individual&#8217;s moral character or status as privileged, oppressing, or oppressed is primarily determined by the individual&#8217;s race, color, sex, or national origin; (iv) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin; (v) An individual, by virtue of the individual&#8217;s race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual played no part; (vi) An individual, by virtue of the individual&#8217;s race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion; (vii) Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; or (viii) the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory. (c) &#8220;Educational service agency&#8221; (ESA) has the meaning given in 20 U.S.C. 1401(5), and the terms &#8220;elementary school,&#8221; &#8220;local educational agency&#8221; (LEA), &#8220;secondary school,&#8221; and &#8220;state educational agency&#8221; (SEA) have the meanings given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c). (d) &#8220;Patriotic education&#8221; means a presentation of the history of America grounded in: (i) an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America&#8217;s founding and foundational principles; (ii) a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history; (iii) the concept that commitment to America&#8217;s aspirations is beneficial and justified; and (iv) the concept that celebration of America&#8217;s greatness and history is proper. (e) &#8220;Social transition&#8221; means the process of adopting a &#8220;gender identity&#8221; or &#8220;gender marker&#8221; that differs from a person&#8217;s sex. This process can include psychological or psychiatric counseling or treatment by a school counselor or other provider; modifying a person&#8217;s name (e.g., &#8220;Jane&#8221; to &#8220;James&#8221;) or pronouns (e.g., &#8220;him&#8221; to &#8220;her&#8221;); calling a child &#8220;nonbinary&#8221;; use of intimate facilities and accommodations such as bathrooms or locker rooms specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex; and participating in school athletic competitions or other extracurricular activities specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex. &#8220;Social transition&#8221; does not include chemical or surgical mutilation. Sec. 3. Ending Indoctrination Strategy. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, to advise the President in formulating future policy, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall provide an Ending Indoctrination Strategy to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, containing recommendations and a plan for: (i) eliminating Federal funding or support for illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology; and (ii) protecting parental rights, pursuant to FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g, and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h, with respect to any K-12 policies or conduct implicated by the purpose and policy of this order. (b) The Ending Indoctrination Strategy submitted under subsection (a) of this section shall contain a summary and analysis of the following: (i) All Federal funding sources and streams, including grants or contracts, that directly or indirectly support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology: (A) in K-12 curriculum, instruction, programs, or activities; or (B) in K-12 teacher education, certification, licensing, employment, or training; (ii) Each agency&#8217;s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an ESA, SEA, LEA, elementary school, or secondary school to directly or indirectly support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology in: (A) K-12 curriculum, instruction, programs, or activities; or (B) K-12 teacher certification, licensing, employment, or training; (iii) Each agency&#8217;s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an ESA, SEA, LEA, elementary school, or secondary school to directly or indirectly support or subsidize the social transition of a minor student, including through school staff or teachers or through deliberately concealing the minor&#8217;s social transition from the minor&#8217;s parents.

(d) The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall regularly convene the heads of the agencies tasked with submitting the Ending Indoctrination Strategy under subsection (a) of this section to confer regarding their findings, areas for additional investigation, the modification or implementation of their respective recommendations, and such other policy initiatives or matters as the President may direct. Sec. 4. Reestablishing the President&#8217;s Advisory 1776 Commission and Promoting Patriotic Education . (a) The President&#8217;s Advisory 1776 Commission (&#8220;1776 Commission&#8221;), which was created by Executive Order 13958 of November 2, 2020, to promote patriotic education, but was terminated by President Biden in Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021, is hereby reestablished. The purpose of the 1776 Commission is to promote patriotic education and advance the purposes stated in section 1 of Executive Order 13958, as well as to advise and promote the work of the White House Task Force on Celebrating America&#8217;s 250th Birthday (&#8220;Task Force 250&#8221;) and the United States Semiquincentennial Commission in their efforts to provide a grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of American Independence on July 4, 2026. (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall establish the 1776 Commission in the Department of Education. (c) The 1776 Commission shall be composed of not more than 20 members, who shall be appointed by the President for a term of 2 years. The 1776 Commission shall be made up of individuals from outside the Federal Government with relevant experience or subject-matter expertise. (d) The 1776 Commission shall have a Chair or Co-Chairs, at the President&#8217;s discretion, and a Vice Chair, who shall be designated by the President from among the Commission&#8217;s members. An Executive Director, designated by the Secretary of Education in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall coordinate the work of the 1776 Commission. The Chair (or Co-Chairs) and Vice Chair shall work with the Executive Director to convene regular meetings of the 1776 Commission, determine its agenda, and direct its work, consistent with this order. (e) The 1776 Commission shall: (i) facilitate the development and implementation of a &#8220;Presidential 1776 Award&#8221; to recognize student knowledge of the American founding, including knowledge about the Founders, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitutional Convention, and the great soldiers and battles of the American Revolutionary War; (ii) in coordination with the White House Office of Public Liaison, coordinate bi-weekly lectures regarding the 250th anniversary of American Independence that are grounded in patriotic education principles, which shall be broadcast to the Nation throughout calendar year 2026; (iii) upon request, advise executive departments and agencies regarding their efforts to ensure patriotic education is appropriately provided to the public at national parks, battlefields, monuments, museums, installations, landmarks, cemeteries, and other places important to the American founding and American history, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law; (iv) upon request, offer advice and recommendations to, and support the work of Task Force 250 and the United States Semiquincentennial Commission regarding their plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of American Independence; and (v) facilitate, advise upon, and promote private and civic activities nationwide to increase public knowledge of and support patriotic education surrounding the 250th anniversary of American Independence, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.

Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism,EXECUTIVE ORDER,29/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/,"Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism EXECUTIVE ORDER January 29, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose. My Administration has fought and will continue to fight anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world. On December 11, 2019, I issued Executive Order 13899, my first Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism, finding that students, in particular, faced anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on university and college campuses. Executive Order 13899 provided interpretive assistance on the enforcement of the Nation&#8217;s civil rights laws to ensure that they would protect American Jews to the same extent to which all other American citizens are protected. The prior administration effectively nullified Executive Order 13899 by failing to give the terms of the order full force and effect throughout the Government. This order reaffirms Executive Order 13899 and directs additional measures to advance the policy thereof in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, against the people of Israel. These attacks unleashed an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses. Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault. A joint report by the House Committees on Education and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Oversight and Accountability, Veterans&#8217; Affairs, and Ways and Means calls the Federal Government&#8217;s failure to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students &#8220;astounding.&#8221; This failure is unacceptable and ends today. Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-Semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence. Sec. 3. Additional Measures to Combat Campus Anti-Semitism. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency) shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, identifying all civil and criminal authorities or actions within the jurisdiction of that agency, beyond those already implemented under Executive Order 13899, that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism. (b) The report submitted by the Attorney General under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all court cases, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism and indicate whether the Attorney General intends to or has taken any action with respect to such matters, including filing statements of interest or intervention. (c) The Attorney General is encouraged to employ appropriate civil-rights enforcement authorities, such as 18 U.S.C. 241, to combat anti-Semitism. (d) The report submitted by the Secretary of Education under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all Title VI complaints and administrative actions, including in K-12 education, related to anti-Semitism &#8212; pending or resolved after October 7, 2023 &#8212; within the Department&#8217;s Office for Civil Rights. (e) In addition to identifying relevant authorities to curb or combat anti-Semitism generally required by this section, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with each other, shall include in their reports recommendations for familiarizing institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) so that such institutions may monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff relevant to those grounds and for ensuring that such reports about aliens lead, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to investigations and, if warranted, actions to remove such aliens. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Such last-minute, lame-duck CBAs, which purport to bind a new President to his predecessor&#8217;s policies, run counter to America&#8217;s system of democratic self-government. &nbsp;CBAs quickly negotiated to include extreme policies on the eve of a new administration are purposefully designed to circumvent the will of the people and our democracy. &nbsp;Such CBAs inhibit the President&#8217;s authority to manage the executive branch by tying his hands with inefficient and ineffective practices. &nbsp;The Supreme Court has explained that a President &#8220;cannot choose to bind his successors by diminishing their powers.&#8221; Therefore, it is the policy of the executive branch that CBAs executed in the 30 days prior to the inauguration of a new President, and that purport to remain in effect despite the inauguration of a new President and administration, shall not be approved. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Standards for CBA Duration. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;No executive department or agency (agency) or agency employees shall make a CBA governing conditions of employment in the 30 days prior to a change in Presidential administrations that: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creates new contractual obligations; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;makes substantive changes to existing agreements; or (iii) &nbsp;extends the duration of an existing agreement. (b)&nbsp; Subsection (a) of this section applies only to the extent that its requirements do not prevent CBAs from rolling over under existing contractual provisions. (c) &nbsp;To the extent that subordinate agency personnel have executed a CBA that violates the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, but the applicable agency head has not yet approved such agreement pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7114(c), such agency head shall promptly disapprove such agreement as inconsistent with the requirements of this memorandum.&nbsp; (d) &nbsp;The requirements of this section do not apply to CBAs that primarily cover law enforcement officers, as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. 1515(a)(4). Sec. 3. &nbsp;General Provisions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;If the Federal Labor Relations Authority or a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final judgment holding that section 2(d) of this memorandum would prevent this memorandum from being considered a Government-wide rule or regulation for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(1), section 2(d) of this memorandum shall be severed and rendered inoperative thereby and given no force or effect. (d)&nbsp; This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United&nbsp;States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

UNLEASHING PROSPERITY THROUGH DEREGULATION,EXECUTIVE ORDER,31/01/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/,"Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions UNLEASHING PROSPERITY THROUGH DEREGULATION EXECUTIVE ORDER January 31, 2025 UNLEASHING PROSPERITY THROUGH DEREGULATION By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended (31&nbsp;U.S.C. 1101 et seq .), and in order to promote prudent financial management and alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens, it is hereby ordered:&nbsp; Section 1. Purpose. The ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness. Despite the magnitude of their impact, these measures are often difficult for the average person or business to understand, as they require synthesizing the collective meaning not just of formal regulations but also rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements that are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, further increasing compliance costs and the risk of costs of non-compliance. It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America&#8217;s economic prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen. To that end, it is important that for each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination. This practice is to ensure that the cost of planned regulations is responsibly managed and controlled through a rigorous regulatory budgeting process. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds, from both public and private sources, and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people. Sec. 3. Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2025. (a) Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency (agency) publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least 10 existing regulations to be repealed. (b) &nbsp;For fiscal year 2025, which is in progress, the heads of all agencies are directed to ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero, as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director), unless otherwise required by law or instructions from the Director. (c) &nbsp;In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of&nbsp;this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least 10&nbsp;prior regulations. (d) &nbsp;The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of this section. &nbsp;Such guidance shall address, among other things, processes for standardizing the measurement and estimation of regulatory costs; standards for determining what qualifies as new and offsetting regulations; standards for determining the costs of existing regulations that are considered for elimination; processes for accounting for costs in different fiscal years; methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section. &nbsp;The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements. Sec. 4. Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget. Beginning with the Regulatory Plans, as required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended, or any successor order for fiscal year 2026, and for each fiscal year thereafter: (a) &nbsp;The head of each agency shall identify on an aggregated basis, for regulations that increase incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 3(c) of this order, and provide the agency&#8217;s best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. (b) &nbsp;Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order. &nbsp;Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be added to or removed from the Unified Regulatory Agenda without the approval of the Director. &nbsp;To accomplish the purposes of this order, the Director may also require additions to the Unified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50&nbsp;U.S.C. 1601 et seq .) (NEA), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section&nbsp;301 of&nbsp;title&nbsp;3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of illicit opioids and other drugs has profound consequences on our Nation, endangering lives and putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, public services, and communities. This challenge threatens the fabric of our society. Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illicit drugs of all kinds have poured across our borders and into our communities. Canada has played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs. Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are the world&#8217;s leading producers of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illicit drugs, and they cultivate, process, and distribute massive quantities of narcotics that fuel addiction and violence in communities across the United States.&nbsp; These DTOs often collaborate with transnational cartels to smuggle illicit drugs into the United States, utilizing clandestine airstrips, maritime routes, and overland corridors.&nbsp; The challenges at our southern border are foremost in the public consciousness, but our northern border is not exempt from these issues.&nbsp; Criminal networks are implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations, enabling unvetted illegal migration across our northern border.&nbsp; There is also a growing presence of Mexican cartels operating fentanyl and nitazene synthesis labs in Canada.&nbsp; The flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl to the United States through both illicit distribution networks and international mail &#8212; due, in the case of the latter, to the existing administrative exemption from duty and taxes, also known as de minimis , under section 1321 of title 19, United States Code &#8212; has created a public health crisis in the United States, as outlined in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) and Executive Order 14157 of January 20, 2025 (Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists).&nbsp; With respect to smuggling of illicit drugs across our northern border, Canada&#8217;s Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre recently published a study on the laundering of proceeds of illicit synthetic opioids, which recognized Canada&#8217;s heightened domestic production of fentanyl, largely from British Columbia, and its growing footprint within international narcotics distribution.&nbsp; Despite a North American dialogue on the public health impacts of illicit drugs since 2016, Canadian officials have acknowledged that the problem has only grown.&nbsp; And while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security seized, comparatively, much less fentanyl from Canada than from Mexico last year, fentanyl is so potent that even a very small parcel of the drug can cause many deaths and destruction to America families.&nbsp; In fact, the amount of fentanyl that crossed the northern border last year could kill 9.5 million Americans. Immediate action is required to finally end this public health crisis and national emergency, which will not happen unless the compliance and cooperation of Canada is assured. I hereby determine and order: Section 1. (a) As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens. A Nation without borders is not a nation at all. I will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, our citizens to be endangered, or our borders to be disrespected anymore. I previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs into the United States in Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border). Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that Proclamation to cover the threat to the safety and security of Americans, including the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept DTOs, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs. In addition, this failure to act on the part of Canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat. This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Canada set forth in this order. In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat. Sec. 2. (a) All articles that are products of Canada as defined by the Federal Register notice described in subsection (e) of this section ( Federal Register notice), and except for those products described in subsection (b) of this section, shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty. Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to CBP as specified in the Federal Register notice. (b)&nbsp; With respect to energy or energy resources, as defined in section 8 of Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), and as otherwise included in the Federal Register notice, such articles that are products of Canada as defined by the Federal Register notice shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty.&nbsp; Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to CBP as specified in the Federal Register notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; The rates of duty established by this order are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, or charges applicable to such imported articles.&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; Should Canada retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action. (e)&nbsp; In order to establish the duty rate on imports of articles that are products of Canada, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine the modifications necessary to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) in order to effectuate this order consistent with law and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the Federal Register .&nbsp; The modifications made to the HTSUS by this notice shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, and shall continue in effect until such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. (f)&nbsp; Articles that are products of Canada, except those that are eligible for admission under &#8220;domestic status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duties imposed by this order and are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except as otherwise noted in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, must be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.41.&nbsp; Such articles will be subject upon entry for consumption to the rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading in effect at the time of admittance into the United States foreign trade zone .&nbsp; (g)&nbsp; No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this order.&nbsp; (h)&nbsp; For avoidance of doubt, duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 shall not be available for the articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Any prior Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other Presidential directive or guidance related to trade with Canada that is inconsistent with the direction in this order is hereby terminated, suspended, or modified to the extent necessary to give full effect to this order.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (j)&nbsp; The articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section shall exclude those encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b). Sec. 3. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall regularly consult with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security on the situation at our northern border. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, indicate that the Government of Canada has taken adequate steps to alleviate this public health crisis through cooperative enforcement actions. Upon the President&#8217;s determination of sufficient action to alleviate the crisis, the tariffs described in section 2 of this order shall be removed. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crises through cooperative enforcement actions. Sec. 4. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Homeland Security. All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec. 5. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency under IEEPA declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).

Canada’s Liberal leadership race: Who’s running to replace Justin Trudeau?,Al Jazeera,2025-02-01,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/24/canadas-liberal-leadership-race-whos-running-to-replace-justin-trudeau,"Canada’s Liberal leadership race: Who’s running to replace Justin Trudeau? Former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and ex-Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney are frontrunners, experts say. Candidates are vying to replace Justin Trudeau as leader of Canada’s ruling Liberal Party – and as the country’s prime minister. The Liberals are hoping that a new leader – set to be chosen on March 9 – will bolster their chances ahead of this year’s federal election. Polls show they are currently on track to lose by a wide margin to the opposition Conservative Party: A recent Abacus Data survey had the Conservatives with 46 percent support compared with 20 percent for the Liberals. It is unclear which candidate would give the Liberals the best shot at the polls. But the vote could be called as soon as Canadian lawmakers go back to the House of Commons on March 24, as opposition legislators have pledged to try to topple the Liberal government at the earliest opportunity. The election must be held by October 20. Semra Sevi, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said the race for the Liberal Party leadership has three credible candidates: economist Mark Carney and two former Trudeau cabinet ministers, Chrystia Freeland and Karina Gould. Advertisement “However, Carney and Freeland are the clear frontrunners,” Sevi told Al Jazeera. Here, Al Jazeera looks at the candidates vying to lead the Liberal Party, where they stand on key issues, and whether they will be able to help the party make up ground ahead of the next election. Mark Carney, former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney Carney announced his leadership bid at a rally in Edmonton, Alberta, on January 16 [Amber Bracken/Reuters] Carney, 59, has tried to portray himself as a political outsider, putting distance between himself and the widely unpopular Trudeau. The economist previously served as governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, and he acted as an economic adviser to Trudeau’s government. He currently holds a role at the United Nations as a special envoy on climate action and finance. “Too many are falling behind. Too many young people can’t afford a home. Too many people can’t find a doctor,” he said during a rally to announce his Liberal leadership bid in Edmonton, the capital of Canada’s oil-rich province of Alberta, on January 16. According to Sevi, Carney’s experience as a former central banker gives him “substantial credibility on economic issues”, which have been a major concern for Canadians amid rising costs and a housing crisis. “He can position himself as an expert in managing inflation, housing affordability and financial insecurity,” she told Al Jazeera. Yet on the flip side, Carney’s “lack of direct political experience could make him seem out of touch with grassroots concerns”, Sevi said. “His technocratic background may not translate easily into the kind of leadership voters expect during tough times.” The decision to launch his campaign from his home province of Alberta – where residents typically vote for right-wing parties – was also noted by experts. Advertisement “The new Liberal leader will need to focus on regaining support in western Canada, particularly in Alberta,” Sevi explained. In that vein, Carney has said he is open to alternatives to an unpopular federal programme that placed a price on carbon emissions. The climate policy, introduced under Trudeau, is a top target of attacks from right-wing politicians, including Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, who is hoping to make it a central election issue. With Trudeau leaving, it has become an early point of contention in the Liberal leadership race, as well. Poilievre, a populist politician who has been in Parliament since the early 2000s, has used the nickname “Carbon Tax Carney” to blast the economist for his past support of the policy. “It’s clear that Carbon Tax Carney and the Liberals will say anything to try and hold power. But they cannot be trusted. Carbon Tax Carney is just like Justin,” the Conservatives said in a recent statement. Despite those attacks, Carney has racked up endorsements from top Liberal ministers, including Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault and Minister of Emergency Preparedness Harjit Sajjan. The backing of ministers from the French-speaking province of Quebec – where the Liberals typically draw a key segment of their support – may also prove critical for Carney, according to Jim Bickerton, a political science professor at St Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia. Advertisement “It’s always important that the Liberal leader have a strong support base in Quebec,” Bickerton told Al Jazeera. In a new campaign video released on Thursday, Carney also hit back at Poilievre, comparing him to United States President Donald Trump, who has embraced anti-immigrant policies and regularly attacks the media and his perceived critics. “You can’t stand up to Trump when you’re working from his playbook,” Carney says in the video. “Pierre Poilievre has been a politician his entire life, and in all that time, he hasn’t fixed a thing. He just complains, misleads and blames everything on someone else.” Chrystia Freeland, ex-deputy prime minister and finance minister Chrystia Freeland Freeland holds a campaign event in Toronto on January 19 [Cole Burston/Reuters] Freeland has been a key member of Trudeau’s inner circle since she was first elected to represent a Toronto electoral district – known as a riding – in 2015, the year the Liberals swept into power. Since then, she has held various high-profile government portfolios, including as deputy prime minister and finance minister. But in a surprise move, Freeland announced in December that she was resigning from Trudeau’s cabinet. In her resignation letter, she said she was stepping down because she and Trudeau were “at odds about the best path forward” for Canada in the face of a threat from Trump to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods. Her break from Trudeau is believed to have been a key factor in the prime minister’s decision to step down as Liberal leader. Advertisement Freeland had led the Canadian team tasked with renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during Trump’s first term as president, from 2017 to 2021 – and she has pitched herself as the best person to manage US-Canada ties with Trump in the White House again. “If you hit us, we will hit back,” she said during her leadership campaign launch on January 19. She also promised to “inflict the biggest trade blow that the United States has ever endured” if Trump follows through on his tariff threat. A staunch defender of Ukraine amid Russia’s war, Freeland – who is of Ukrainian descent – has garnered endorsements from a number of Liberal MPs, including cabinet members such as Health Minister Mark Holland and Justice Minister Arif Virani. But with recent polls showing that Canadians want change after nearly a decade of Liberal rule, experts say that Freeland’s status as a former member of Trudeau’s team may hurt her. “She’s been Justin Trudeau’s right-hand really for the duration of this government … She’s been a loyal soldier,” said Bickerton. “And that’s probably a weak point because if, in fact, after 9.5 years, Canadians are ready for a change in direction or a change in government, then she doesn’t fit the bill because she’s very closely associated with the current government.” Advertisement Nevertheless, if chosen to lead the party, Freeland could try to appeal to the more progressive side of the Liberal base by highlighting her involvement in key social programmes over the past five years, Bickerton said. “Oftentimes, the Liberals either win power or lose power based on how much of the [left-leaning New Democratic Party] NDP support they can draw to themselves,” he said. “I think Chrystia Freeland will probably stake her appeal to the Liberals on that basis.” Play Video 2:35 Now Playing 02:35 Canada’s Trudeau to step down as Liberal Party leader amid pressure Canada’s Trudeau to step down as Liberal Party leader amid pressure Next 03:07 Gaza’s civil defence team search the rubble for remains of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks Gaza’s civil defence team search the rubble for remains of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks 02:22 Israeli tanks rolled into occupied West Bank for the first time in more than 20 years Israeli tanks rolled into occupied West Bank for the first time in more than 20 years 01:26 Russia-Ukraine war: 3 years on, at what cost? Russia-Ukraine war: 3 years on, at what cost? 02:25 USAID cuts threaten Philippines' fight against rising HIV cases USAID cuts threaten Philippines' fight against rising HIV cases So far, she has attempted to break from some of the less popular policies pursued by the Trudeau-led government, including by promising to cancel the carbon pricing scheme for Canadian consumers. “Where people have a consumer-facing price on carbon, they’re saying, ‘You know, we don’t like it,'” she said in a recent interview. “So we have to listen, and at the same time, we do need a strong plan to fight climate change.” She has also argued that Trump’s “obvious dislike of her” is a strength, Bickerton noted. “She presents that as a positive thing, that she’s a tough negotiator, that she’s a strong woman who would be able to stand up to Trump in the current aggressive tariff war that’s looming.” Yet, in the early days of the leadership race, the government’s record appears to be following her. In a scene reminiscent of what former Vice President Kamala Harris faced during the 2024 US presidential election, Freeland’s campaign launch event was repeatedly interrupted by protesters denouncing Canada’s support for Israel amid the war in Gaza. Advertisement The demonstrators held up a banner that read, “Freeland: Our deputy PM gravedigger”, a reference to the more than 47,100 Palestinians killed in Israel’s 15-month bombardment of the enclave. Karina Gould, ex-leader of the Liberal government in the House of Commons Canadian MP Karina Gould speaks in the House of Commons Gould delivers the Fall Economic Statement in the House of Commons in December 2024 [Blair Gable/Reuters] The 37-year-old MP from Burlington, Ontario, has held various positions within the Liberal government since she was elected to Parliament in 2015. Over her time in office, she has served as the minister of democratic institutions, minister for international development, and minister of families, children and social development. In the latter role, she helped implement a national childcare programme that cut daycare costs for Canadians. In 2023, she was named leader of the government in the House of Commons – a cabinet role she resigned from earlier this month to launch her Liberal leadership bid. “We have a big challenge ahead of us. Canadians have lost trust in our party, and if we are going to be able to keep building our country, we must rebuild our party,” she said during a rally to launch her campaign on January 19. “I became a Liberal at the age of 14 because I believe in Canada. I believe in who we are as a people. I believe in the promise that we represent for the entire world. The Liberal Party of Canada is not a hobby for me; it is not a side project.” The youngest candidate in the race, Gould credited the “bold ideas of the young Liberals of Canada” with pushing forward same-sex marriage legislation, marijuana legalisation and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. She added that she wants to re-engage party members to bring new ideas forward and usher in a “new generation” of leadership. Advertisement According to Sevi, “Gould could attract attention from younger voters and those looking for a future-focused choice.” The professor also noted that her fluency in French “gives her an edge” in Quebec, whereas Carney and Freeland are less proficient in the language. “While Gould is unlikely to win this time, selecting her could be a smart long-term strategy. Regardless of who wins the leadership, the Liberals are unlikely to win in the 2025 election,” Sevi said. If Gould does win the leadership race, she will become the youngest prime minister in Canadian history. Chandra Arya, Ottawa-area MP Arya, who was first elected to Parliament in 2015 in the Ottawa-area riding of Nepean, said on January 26 that he was informed by the party that he “will not be permitted to enter the leadership race”. The Liberal Party has not explained why the decision was taken, but confirmed on its website that Arya was not among the six candidates in the running. Arya recently faced widespread criticism for saying that people in Quebec won’t care if the next Liberal leader speaks French. Canada has both English and French as its official languages, and historically, the leaders of federal parties have made an effort to communicate in French. Advertisement Arya’s stance amid Canada’s allegations that Indian government agents were involved in the killing of a prominent Sikh Canadian activist has also drawn scrutiny. Originally from India, he has spoken out against what he calls “Khalistani extremists” – separatists pushing for an independent Sikh state in India’s Punjab province. He also travelled to India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August of last year amid the row between Ottawa and New Delhi. India has denied any wrongdoing. Jaime Battiste, Nova Scotia MP Battiste, a parliament member for Sydney-Victoria, a riding in the eastern province of Nova Scotia, since 2019, dropped out of the Liberal leadership race on January 30. The first Mi’kmaw person ever elected to Canada’s Parliament, Battiste said he believed the best way to achieving his goals – of advancing reconciliation, environmental protection and affordability – was to endorse Carney as leader. “I am excited for the next chapter of this leadership race, and I am excited that as Canadians we get to stand together to pick the next Liberal Leader and Prime Minister,” he said in a statement. Battiste has served as chair of the Liberal Indigenous caucus and the parliamentary secretary to the minister of Crown-Indigenous relations.“My vision has always prioritised protecting human rights, reconciliation and the environmental sustainability for future generations,” he had said in a campaign video. “I believe in the good work that we’ve done … But I don’t believe the work is finished.” Frank Baylis, Quebec businessman and former MP Baylis was elected to the House of Commons in the Montreal-area riding of Pierrefonds-Dollard in 2015. He held the seat until the next election in 2019, when he chose not to run again. “During that time, I championed Canadian innovation, supported human rights, and collaborated across party lines to address systemic challenges,” Baylis said. An entrepreneur, he also has touted his business experience over the past decades and said he intends to help tackle Canada’s affordability crisis. “As your leader, I will focus on making life more affordable for families, addressing economic challenges head-on, and investing in Canadian industries and innovation to create good-paying jobs,” he said. Ruby Dhalla, former MP Dhalla represented the Toronto-area riding of Brampton-Springdale from 2004 to 2011, when she lost re-election. She was one of the first women of Indian origin to serve in Parliament. In a recent interview, Dhalla stressed that she is the only candidate in the race who has no connection to the Trudeau government. “The first act that I would do as the leader of the party is to ensure that we get back towards the centre, to the right of centre, because I think that is the need of the hour,” she said.

Background. On February 1, 2025, I determined that the failure of Mexico to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept Mexican drug trafficking organizations, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To address that threat, I invoked my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to impose ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Mexico. Sec. 2. Immediate Steps . Pursuant to section 3 of my Executive Order of February 1, 2025, titled &#8220;Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our Southern Border&#8221; (&#8220;the Executive Order of February 1, 2025&#8221;), I have determined that the Government of Mexico has taken immediate steps designed to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crisis through cooperative actions. Further time is needed, however, to assess whether these steps constitute sufficient action to alleviate the crisis and resolve the unusual and extraordinary threat beyond our southern border. Sec. 3. Pause. (a) In recognition of the steps taken by the Government of Mexico, and in order to assess whether the threat described in section 1 of this order has abated, the additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty shall be paused and will not take effect until March 4, 2025, at 12:01 am eastern time. Accordingly, sections 2(a), sections 2(d), and section 2(e) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, are amended by striking the term &#8220;February 4, 2025,&#8221; where it appears in those sections and inserting in lieu thereof the term &#8220;March, 4, 2025.&#8221; The exceptions set forth in section 2(a) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, related to covered goods loaded onto a vessel at a port of entry or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States are, hereby, withdrawn. (b) During this pause, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall continue to assess the situation at our southern border, as provided in section 3 of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025. (c) If the illegal migration and illicit drug crises worsen, and if the Government of Mexico fails to take sufficient steps to alleviate these crises, the President shall take necessary steps to address the situation, including by immediate implementation of the tariffs described in the Executive Order of February 1, 2025.

Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,EXECUTIVE ORDER,05/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/,"Keeping Men Out of Women&#039;s Sports &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Keeping Men Out of Women&#8217;s Sports EXECUTIVE ORDER February 5, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Policy and Purpose. In recent years, many educational institutions and athletic associations have allowed men to compete in women&#8217;s sports. This is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports. Moreover, under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (Title IX), educational institutions receiving Federal funds cannot deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.&nbsp; As some Federal courts have recognized, &#8220;ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities.&#8221;&nbsp; Tennessee v. Cardona , 24-cv-00072 at 73 (E.D. Ky. 2024). See also Kansas v. U.S. Dept. of Education , 24-cv-04041 at 23 (D. Kan. 2024) (highlighting &#8220;Congress&#8217; goals of protecting biological women in education&#8221;).&nbsp; Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.&nbsp; It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women&#8217;s sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth. Sec. 2. Definitions. The definitions in Executive Order 14168 of January 20, 2025 (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government), shall apply to this order. Sec.3. Preserving Women&#8217;s Sports in Education. (a) In furtherance of the purposes of Title IX, the Secretary of Education shall promptly: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in coordination with the Attorney General, continue to comply with the vacatur of the rule entitled &#8220;Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance&#8221; of April 29, 2024, 89 FR 33474, see Tennessee v. Cardona , 24-cv-00072 at 13-15 (E.D. Ky. 2025), and take other appropriate action to ensure this regulation does not have effect; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;take all appropriate action to affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms and thereby provide the equal opportunity guaranteed by Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, including enforcement actions described in subsection (iii); to bring regulations and policy guidance into line with the Congress&#8217; existing demand for &#8220;equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes&#8221; by clearly specifying and clarifying that women&#8217;s sports are reserved for women; and the resolution of pending litigation consistent with this policy; and (iii) &nbsp;prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions (including athletic associations composed of or governed by such institutions) that deny female students an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them, in the women&#8217;s category, to compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males. (b) &nbsp;All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order. (c) &nbsp;The Department of Justice shall provide all necessary resources, in accordance with law, to relevant agencies to ensure expeditious enforcement of the policy established in this order.&nbsp; Sec. 4. Preserving Fairness and Safety in Women&#8217;s Sports . Many sport-specific governing bodies have no official position or requirements regarding trans-identifying athletes. Others allow men to compete in women&#8217;s categories if these men reduce the testosterone in their bodies below certain levels or provide documentation of &#8220;sincerely held&#8221; gender identity. These policies are unfair to female athletes and do not protect female safety. To address these concerns, it is hereby ordered: (a) &nbsp;The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall, within 60 days of the date of this order: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; convene representatives of major athletic organizations and governing bodies, and female athletes harmed by such policies, to promote policies that are fair and safe, in the best interests of female athletes, and consistent with the requirements of Title IX, as applicable; and (ii)&nbsp; convene State Attorneys General to identify best practices in defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women to participate in sports and educate them about stories of women and girls who have been harmed by male participation in women&#8217;s sports. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of State, including through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs&#8217; Sports Diplomacy Division and the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, shall: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; rescind support for and participation in people-to-people sports exchanges or other sports programs within which the relevant female sports category is based on identity and not sex; and (ii)&nbsp; promote, including at the United Nations, international rules and norms governing sports competition to protect a sex-based female sports category, and, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, convene international athletic organizations and governing bodies, and female athletes harmed by policies that allow male participation in women&#8217;s sports, to promote sporting policies that are fair, safe, and in furtherance of the best interests of female athletes. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall review and adjust, as needed, policies permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women&#8217;s sports, and shall issue guidance with an objective of preventing such entry to the extent permitted by law, including pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)). (d) &nbsp;The Secretary of State shall use all appropriate and available measures to see that the International Olympic Committee amends the standards governing Olympic sporting events to promote fairness, safety, and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women&#8217;s sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction. Sec. 5. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) &nbsp;If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias,EXECUTIVE ORDER,06/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/eradicating-anti-christian-bias/,"Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias EXECUTIVE ORDER February 6, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose and Policy. It is the policy of the United States, and the purpose of this order, to protect the religious freedoms of Americans and end the anti-Christian weaponization of government. The Founders established a Nation in which people were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by their government. For that reason, the United States Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to religious liberty in the First Amendment. Federal laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq. ), further prohibit government interference with Americans&#8217; rights to exercise their religion. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. ), prohibits religious discrimination in employment while Federal hate-crime laws prohibit offenses committed due to religious animus. Yet the previous Administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians, while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses. The Biden Department of Justice sought to squelch faith in the public square by bringing Federal criminal charges and obtaining in numerous cases multi-year prison sentences against nearly two dozen peaceful pro-life Christians for praying and demonstrating outside abortion facilities. Those convicted included a Catholic priest and 75-year-old grandmother, as well as an 87-year-old woman and a father of 11 children who were arrested 18 months after praying and singing hymns outside an abortion facility in Tennessee as a part of a politically motivated prosecution campaign by the Biden Administration. I rectified this injustice on January 23, 2025, by issuing pardons in these cases. At the same time, Catholic churches, charities, and pro-life centers sought justice for violence, theft, and arson perpetrated against them, which the Biden Department of Justice largely ignored. After more than 100 attacks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning this violence and calling on the Biden Administration to enforce the law. Then, in 2023, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum asserted that &#8220;radical-traditionalist&#8221; Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as &#8220;threat mitigation.&#8221; This later-retracted FBI memorandum cited as support evidence propaganda from highly partisan sources. The Biden Department of Education sought to repeal religious-liberty protections for faith-based organizations on college campuses. The Biden Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sought to force Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith. And the Biden Department of Health and Human Services sought to drive Christians who do not conform to certain beliefs on sexual orientation and gender identity out of the foster-care system. The Biden Administration declared March 31, 2024 &#8212; Easter Sunday &#8212; as &#8220;Transgender Day of Visibility.&#8221; In this atmosphere of anti-Christian government, hostility and vandalism against Christian churches and places of worship surged, with the number of such identified acts in 2023 exceeding by more than eight times the number from 2018. Catholic churches and institutions have been aggressively targeted with hundreds of acts of hostility, violence, and vandalism. My Administration will not tolerate anti-Christian weaponization of government or unlawful conduct targeting Christians. The law protects the freedom of Americans and groups of Americans to practice their faith in peace, and my Administration will enforce the law and protect these freedoms. My Administration will ensure that any unlawful and improper conduct, policies, or practices that target Christians are identified, terminated, and rectified. Sec. 2. Establishing a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias. (a) There is hereby established within the Department of Justice the Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias (Task Force). (b) The Attorney General shall serve as Chair of the Task Force. (c) In addition to the Chair, the Task Force shall consist of the following other members: (i) the Secretary of State; (ii) the Secretary of the Treasury; (iii) the Secretary of Defense; (iv) the Secretary of Labor; (v) the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (vi) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; (vii) the Secretary of Education; (viii) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; (ix) the Secretary of Homeland Security; (x) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; (xi) Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations; (xii) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration; (xiii) the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; (xiv) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy; (xv) the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; (xvi) the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; and (xvii) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices that the Chair may, from time to time, invite to participate. Sec. 3. Task Force Functions. (a) The Task Force shall meet as required by the Chair and shall take appropriate action to: (i) review the activities of all executive departments and agencies (agencies), including the Department of State, the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, over the previous Administration and identify any unlawful anti-Christian policies, practices, or conduct by an agency contrary to the purpose and policy of this order; (ii) recommend to the head of the relevant agency steps to revoke or terminate any violative policies, practices, or conduct identified under subsection (3)(a)(i) of this section and remedial actions to fulfill the purpose and policy of this order; (iii) share information and develop strategies to protect the religious liberties of Americans and advance the purpose and policy of this order; (iv) solicit information and ideas from a broad range of individuals and groups, including Americans affected by anti-Christian conduct, faith-based organizations, and State, local, and Tribal governments, in order to ensure that its work is informed by a broad spectrum of ideas and experiences; (v) identify deficiencies in existing laws and enforcement and regulatory practices that have contributed to unlawful anti-Christian governmental or private conduct and recommend to the relevant agency head, or recommend to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, as applicable, appropriate actions that agencies may take to remedy failures to fully enforce the law against acts of anti-Christian hostility, vandalism, and violence; and (vi) recommend to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, any additional Presidential or legislative action necessary to rectify past improper anti-Christian conduct, protect religious liberty, or otherwise fulfill the purpose and policy of this order. (b) In order to advise the President regarding its work and assist the President in formulating future policy, the Task Force shall submit to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy: (i) a report within 120 days from the date of this order regarding the Task Force&#8217;s initial work; (ii) a report within 1 year from the date of this order that summarizes the Task Force&#8217;s work; and (iii) a final report upon the dissolution of the Task Force. Sec. 4. Administration. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, upon the request of the Chair, provide the Task Force with any information required by the Task Force for the purpose of carrying out its functions. (b) The Department of Justice shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the Task Force may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations. Sec. 5. Termination. The Task Force shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order unless extended by the President. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the International Criminal Court (ICC), as established by the Rome Statute, has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel. &nbsp;The ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. &nbsp;The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel, as neither country is party to the Rome Statute or a member of the ICC.&nbsp; Neither country has ever recognized the ICC&#8217;s jurisdiction, and both nations are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war. &nbsp;The ICC&#8217;s recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest. &nbsp;This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel. &nbsp;Furthermore, in 2002, the Congress enacted the American Servicemembers&#8217; Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7421 et seq. ) to protect United States military personnel, United States officials, and officials and military personnel of certain allied countries against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party, stating, &#8220;In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and other senior elected and appointed officials of the United States Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.&#8221; (22 U.S.C. 7421(9)). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The United States unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to oppose any ICC actions against the United States, Israel, or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction. &nbsp;The United States remains committed to accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of international order, but the ICC and parties to the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICC&#8217;s jurisdiction, consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The United States will impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC&#8217;s transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members, as their entry into our Nation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. &nbsp; &nbsp; I therefore determine that any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons, as defined in section 8(d) of this order, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to address that threat.&nbsp; I hereby determine and order: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the person listed in the Annex to this order; and (ii)&nbsp; any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General: (A) &nbsp;to have directly engaged in any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute a protected person without consent of that person&#8217;s country of nationality; (B) &nbsp;to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any activity in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section or any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or (C) &nbsp;to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. (b) &nbsp;The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 2. &nbsp;I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to address the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 3. &nbsp;The prohibitions in section 1(a) of this order include: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 4. &nbsp;The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order, as well as immediate family members of such aliens, or aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, the ICC, would be detrimental to the interests of the United&nbsp;States, and the entry of such persons into the United&nbsp;States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the entry of the person into the United States would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person&#8217;s entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. &nbsp;In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. &nbsp;Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). &nbsp;The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary of State has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 5. &nbsp;Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a report on additional persons that should be included within the scope of section 1 of this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 6. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) &nbsp;Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 7. &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 8. &nbsp;For the purposes of this order: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;the term &#8220;person&#8221; means an individual or entity; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;the term &#8220;entity&#8221; means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;the term &#8220;United States person&#8221; means any United&nbsp;States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including a foreign branch, subsidiary, or employee of such entity), or any person lawfully in the United States; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) &nbsp;the term &#8220;protected person&#8221; means: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; any United States person, unless the United States provides formal consent to ICC jurisdiction over that person or becomes a state party to the Rome Statute, including: (A)&nbsp; current or former members of the Armed Forces of the United States; (B)&nbsp; current or former elected or appointed officials of the United States Government; and (C)&nbsp; any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of the United States Government; and (ii)&nbsp; any foreign person that is a citizen or lawful resident of an ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction over that person or is not a state party to the Rome Statute, including: (A)&nbsp; current or former members of the armed forces of such ally of the United States; (B)&nbsp; current or former elected or appointed government officials of such ally of the United States; and (C)&nbsp; any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of such a government; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) &nbsp;the term &#8220;ally of the United States&#8221; means: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; a government of a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; or (ii)&nbsp; a government of a &#8220;major non-NATO ally,&#8221; as that term is defined by section 2013(7) of the American Servicemembers&#8217; Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7432(7)); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) &nbsp;the term &#8220;immediate family member&#8221; means a spouse or child; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (g) &nbsp;the term &#8220;alien&#8221; has the meanings given to the term in section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)); and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h) &nbsp;the term &#8220;foreign person&#8221; means a person that is not a United States person. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 9. &nbsp;For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1 of this order would render those measures ineffectual. &nbsp;I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 10. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. &nbsp;All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 11. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 12. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Copy link Facebook Email Notes More Gaza, Inc. &quot;What if Adam Neumann runs the roadshow?&quot; Feb 06, 2025 372 Share this post Gray Mirror Gaza, Inc. Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 41 Share I’m worried that the resemblance between President Trump’s Gaza plan and mine will contribute to the weird delusion that I am secretly running the world. No, actually, (a) I have not talked to anyone important about Gaza; and (b) the idea is obvious, anyway. I realize that it seems improbable that we would both have the same crackpot idea. No. It is extremely probable, because the President and I inhabit the same reality. We are both looking up and noticing that the sky is blue. Most people live in crackpot world, where the sky is green and our present Middle East policy is sane. Reality has started to seep into this crackpot world, and the mixture is… remarkable. The reality of the situation is that (a) Gaza is not presently inhabitable, and (b) Gaza, without its residents (even more important, without their complex maze of Ottoman-era land titles), is worth much more than Gaza with its residents, even to its residents . This is 140 square miles of Mediterranean real estate, clear of titles, demolished and demined at a cost of perhaps ten billion dollars. This land becomes the first charter city backed by US legitimacy: Gaza, Inc. Stock symbol: GAZA. The exit strategy of GAZA is to be the first sovereign corporation to join the UN. While there are many trillion-dollar companies, none of them has true sovereignty, much less some of the best land in the world. Is a trillion-dollar IPO a possibility? I think it’s a possibility. What if Adam Neumann runs the roadshow? Why not? Suddenly, each former Gaza resident has $500,000 in GAZA tokens. Does that come with the right to live in Gaza? No—you don’t get any special treatment in Starbucks stores for being an SBUX holder. Does it come with shareholder voting rights over Gaza, Inc? No, because that would defeat the whole purpose of corporate governance—there would be a conflict of interest between the shareholders and the company. On the other hand, the Gazans are now a wealthy, cultured, naturally commercial people. It’s not like there isn’t a Palestinian diaspora everywhere in the world. Take over Africa, or something. Also, someone has to live in the new Gaza—there have to be residence requirements, because any country with open admissions will turn into a gigantic global slum. It will probably work like Dubai, but much more Westernized. But with enough GAZA shares… you might be able to afford it. Of course, it’s not like the Gazans deserve all the equity in Gaza. For one thing, they started a war and lost it. Israel has the right and the power to present a reparations bill. Israel won, so it does not have to pay any reparations. But the Gazans did not completely lose—they have an intact military force, hostages, and substantial public support in both the West and the Arab world. So they can’t get completely boned. Does this logic seem weird? In crackpot world, yes, it’s weird. It’s super weird. But in the real world, which is seeping back into crackpot world through cracks in the pot, this is how deals get done. Learn to love it. How do you get the Gazans out of Gaza? Gaza is a besieged city. Cut off supplies and give the people a safe way to leave. Even the fighters—no one can eat bullets. When Hamas marches out, ideally in battle formation and parade drill, give them the full honors of war and an double allocation of GAZA shares. Again, in crackpot world—super weird. In normal human history, which is rapidly reasserting itself—normal. You think America has a “responsibility to protect”? You think mass migration is bad? Forced deportation, also bad? Have you heard of Artsakh ? Didn’t think so. All real-estate titles have war as a genesis block. War has consequences. At least, in normal world, war has consequences. In the Middle East, we tested the idea that war should have no consequences. The result: 80 years of war, with occasional cease-fires. That’s crackpot world—what my friend Tarik Sadouma calls the “Peace Fetish.” It all belongs in the trashcan with USAID.

On January 20, 2025, I signed Executive Order 14172 (&#8220;Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness&#8221;). Among other actions, that Executive Order required the Secretary of the Interior, acting pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, to &#8220;take all appropriate actions to rename as the &#8216;Gulf of America&#8217; the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the State of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico.&#8221; I took this action in part because, as stated in that Order, &#8220;[t]he area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America.&#8221; Today, I am making my first visit to the Gulf of America since its renaming. As my Administration restores American pride in the history of American greatness, it is fitting and appropriate for our great Nation to come together and commemorate this momentous occasion and the renaming of the Gulf of America. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 9, 2025, as Gulf of America Day. I call upon public officials and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.

Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security,EXECUTIVE ORDER,10/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/,"Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security EXECUTIVE ORDER February 10, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose and Policy. Since its enactment in 1977, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 78dd-1 et seq .) (FCPA) has been systematically, and to a steadily increasing degree, stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States. Current FCPA enforcement impedes the United States&#8217; foreign policy objectives and therefore implicates the President&#8217;s Article II authority over foreign affairs. The President&#8217;s foreign policy authority is inextricably linked with the global economic competitiveness of American companies. American national security depends in substantial part on the United States and its companies gaining strategic business advantages whether in critical minerals, deep-water ports, or other key infrastructure or assets. But overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses &#8212; by our own Government &#8212; for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security. It is therefore the policy of my Administration to preserve the Presidential authority to conduct foreign affairs and advance American economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad. Sec. 2. Policy of Enforcement Discretion. (a) For a period of 180 days following the date of this order, the Attorney General shall review guidelines and policies governing investigations and enforcement actions under the FCPA. During the review period, the Attorney General shall: (i) cease initiation of any new FCPA investigations or enforcement actions, unless the Attorney General determines that an individual exception should be made; (ii) review in detail all existing FCPA investigations or enforcement actions and take appropriate action with respect to such matters to restore proper bounds on FCPA enforcement and preserve Presidential foreign policy prerogatives; and (iii) issue updated guidelines or policies, as appropriate, to adequately promote the President&#8217;s Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs and prioritize American interests, American economic competitiveness with respect to other nations, and the efficient use of Federal law enforcement resources. (b) The Attorney General may extend such review period for an additional 180 days as the Attorney General determines appropriate. (c) FCPA investigations and enforcement actions initiated or continued after the revised guidelines or policies are issued under subsection (a) of this section: (i) shall be governed by such guidelines or policies; and (ii) must be specifically authorized by the Attorney General. (d) After the revised guidelines or policies are issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall determine whether additional actions, including remedial measures with respect to inappropriate past FCPA investigations and enforcement actions, are warranted and shall take any such appropriate actions or, if Presidential action is required, recommend such actions to the President. Sec. 3. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 4. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

ENDING PROCUREMENT AND FORCED USE OF PAPER STRAWS,OTHER,10/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ending-procurement-and-forced-use-of-paper-straws/,"Ending Procurement and Forced Use of Paper Straws &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ENDING PROCUREMENT AND FORCED USE OF PAPER STRAWS February 10, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Policy. An irrational campaign against plastic straws has resulted in major cities, States, and businesses banning the use or automatic inclusion of plastic straws with beverages. Plastic straws are often replaced by paper straws, which are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple straws. Additionally, paper straws sometimes come individually wrapped in plastic, undermining the environmental argument for their use. It is therefore the policy of the United States to end the use of paper straws. Sec. 2. Purchases of Paper Straws by the Federal Government. (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to eliminate the procurement of paper straws and otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings. (b) Agencies shall take appropriate action to eliminate policies designed to disfavor plastic straws issued to further Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability), which I revoked on January 20, 2025. (c) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with relevant agencies, shall issue a National Strategy to End the Use of Paper Straws. This strategy shall address: (i) The elimination of all policies within the executive branch designed to disfavor plastic straws; (ii) Contract policies and terms with entities, including States, that ban or penalize plastic straw purchase or use; and (iii) All other available tools to achieve the policy of this order nationwide. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

ELIMINATING THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE INSTITUTE,EXECUTIVE ORDER,10/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/eliminating-the-federal-executive-institute/,"Eliminating the Federal Executive Institute &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ELIMINATING THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE INSTITUTE EXECUTIVE ORDER February 10, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 4117 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. &nbsp;Purpose and Policy.&nbsp; It is the policy of the United States to treat taxpayer dollars responsibly and advance unifying priorities like a stronger and safer America.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is the policy of my Administration to eliminate, to the greatest extent permitted by law, executive departments and agencies and programs that do not directly benefit the American people or further our Nation&#8217;s interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, the Federal Executive Institute , which was created by the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson more than 50 years ago, is a Government program purportedly designed to provide leadership training to bureaucrats.&nbsp; But bureaucratic leadership over the past half-century has led to Federal policies that enlarge and entrench the Washington, D.C., managerial class, a development that has not benefited the American family. &nbsp;The Federal Executive Institute should therefore be eliminated to refocus Government on serving taxpayers, competence, and dedication to our Constitution, rather than serving the Federal bureaucracy. Sec. 2. &nbsp;Elimination of the Federal Executive Institute. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall take all necessary steps to eliminate the Federal Executive Institute, in accordance with applicable law. (b) &nbsp;All prior Presidential or other executive branch documents establishing or requiring the existence of the Federal Executive Institute, including the Presidential Memorandum of May 9, 1968, regarding the Federal Executive Institute, and any applicable provisions of Executive Order 11348 of April 20, 1967 (Providing for the Further Training of Government Employees), are hereby revoked. Sec. 3. &nbsp;General Provisions.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Fox News&nbsp;chief political&nbsp;anchor Bret Baier asked Trump, 78, in an interview taped ahead of Sunday’s Super&nbsp;Bowl: “Do&nbsp;you view Vice President JD Vance as your successor, the Republican nominee in 2028?” “No, but he’s very capable,” Trump replied. 3 President Trump says it’s too early to know if he will anoint Vice President JD Vance as his successor in 2028. Getty Images “I think you have a lot of very capable people,&#8221; the president added.&nbsp;&#8220;So far&nbsp;I think he’s doing a fantastic job. It’s too early. We’re just starting.” &#8220;By the time we get to the midterms,&#8221; Baier interjected, &#8220;[Vance] is going to be looking for an endorsement.” Explore More Conservative influencer claims she had Elon Musk&#039;s 13th child five months ago Meghan Markle and Prince Harry paying big bucks to Dem operatives via their charity – sparking calls for a congressional probe Barack and Michelle Obama post Valentine&#039;s Day selfie as divorce rumors swirl “A lot of people have said that this has been the greatest opening — almost three weeks — in the history of the presidency,” Trump deflected. The clip aired Monday afternoon, hours after Vance, 40, landed in France with his family for the start of his first foreign trip as vice president.&nbsp; 3 It’s possible that Trump chose not to endorse Vance as his successor to avoid calling attention to the fact that he is constitutionally obligated to leave office when he completes his second term in January 2029. via REUTERS The VP will attend an artificial intelligence summit in Paris before traveling to the annual&nbsp;Munich Security Conference in Germany, which will be held this coming weekend.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman spoke out against rival Elon Musk a day after rejecting a potentially seismic deal that could shape the future of artificial intelligence. He told the Elon Musk-led group of investors that the ChatGPT maker is not for sale — despite a massive offer to buy his company. “Elon tries all sorts of things for a long time. This is the latest — you know, this week’s episode,” Altman told Bloomberg TV in an interview at the Paris AI Action Summit Tuesday. “I think he’s probably just trying to slow us down.” Musk announced Monday he is leading a group of investors who have offered to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion. The OpenAI board will have to consider the massive offer, but it’s unclear whether it will seriously entertain it if it believes Musk will divert from the company’s mission. Nevertheless, the offer could make OpenAI’s reorganization plans more difficult – and significantly more expensive. Musk, an OpenAI cofounder who eventually left the company, has long feuded with Altman and has filed a number of legal complaints against OpenAI and Altman, claiming that the AI company and its leadership have misrepresented OpenAI as a philanthropy. OpenAI is operated by a nonprofit organization that controls an entity called OpenAI LP, a for-profit company that exists within the larger company’s structure. That for-profit company took OpenAI from effectively worthless to a valuation of around $100 billion in just a few years — and Altman is largely credited as the mastermind of that plan and the key to the company’s success. Musk claims that OpenAI has broken with its founding charter by seeking to make a profit with its AI tools. Now Musk is a competitor, as he started his own AI company called x.AI. “I wish he would just compete by building a better product, but I think there’s been a lot of tactics,” Altman said in the interview. “Many, many lawsuits, all sorts of other crazy stuff, now this. And we’ll try to just put our head down and keep working.” Asked whether Musk is approaching his strategy to combat OpenAI from a position of insecurity, Altman agreed and belittled his competitor. “Probably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,” Altman said. “I don’t think he’s, like, a happy person. I do feel for him.” Spokespeople for Musk and X did not respond to a request for comment. Altman said he isn’t concerned that Musk has a new elevated position in President Donald Trump’s White House but acknowledged perhaps he should be. “Maybe I should, but not particularly,” Altman said. “I try to just wake up and think about like, how we’re going to make our technology better.” The Musk-Altman feud so far Musk first sued OpenAI in June 2024, but he dropped that initial lawsuit after the company published a blog post that included several of Musk’s emails from OpenAI’s early days. The emails appeared to show Musk acknowledging the need for the company to make large sums of money to fund the computing resources needed to power its AI ambitions, which stood in contrast to the claims in his lawsuit that OpenAI was wrongly pursuing profit. Musk filed a new lawsuit in August 2024 and accused OpenAI of racing to develop powerful “artificial general intelligence” technology to “maximize profits.” Musk also accused the company of engaging in racketeering. OpenAI, meanwhile, accused Musk of essentially being jealous that he was no longer involved in the startup, after he left OpenAI in 2018 following an unsuccessful bid to convince his fellow co-founders to let Tesla acquire it. Altman rejected Musk’s contention that OpenAI is abandoning its nonprofit roots, even though the company is working to spin out its for-profit entity to give it more leeway. “We’re not moving to a for-profit model,” Altman said. “I mean we’re not sure we’re gonna do it all. But no matter what, the nonprofit will continue to be extremely important; it will drive the mission and will continue to exist. The board is looking at lots of options about how to best structure for this next phase but the nonprofit is not going anywhere.” But the nearly $100 billion offer from Musk and his associates could throw a wrench into the gears of OpenAI’s plans. To spin out the for-profit unit, the nonprofit will probably maintain a stake and need to set a value on the deal. If Musk’s deal is legitimate (and it very well may be, as Musk is the richest person in the world), then OpenAI most likely would have a responsibility to demonstrate that its deal better values the company. In other words: Musk just set the floor on that deal at $97.4 billion. Yet it’s not quite that simple. Because OpenAI is a nonprofit, it has no fiduciary responsibility to maximize returns. And it could argue that Musk would violate the company’s safety-first mission. Whatever the case, the world’s most prominent AI company has a much trickier road ahead now than it had before.

Sec . 4 . Election of Procedures . When the Secretary concludes that a member of the Foreign Service, a Civil Service employee, or other staff has demonstrated performance or conduct that warrants a personnel action, the Secretary shall, with respect to officials appointed by the Secretary or others within the Department, take appropriate action, subject to the supervision of the President, and shall, with respect to officials appointed by the President, preliminarily determine whether to refer such a matter for the President&#8217;s consideration. Such preliminary determination shall be made in the Secretary&#8217;s sole and exclusive discretion. Sec . 5 . Foreign Service Reform . (a) The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, reform the Foreign Service and the administration of foreign relations to ensure faithful and effective implementation of the President&#8217;s foreign policy agenda.

By Jon Skolnik February 12, 2025 Vice President JD Vance during a news conference in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2025. By Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg/Getty Images. Save this story Save Save this story Save JD Vance emerged as a media darling with Hillbilly Elegy, his best-selling 2016 memoir of growing up poor in Ohio. But that’s just one of several hats he’s worn—Yale-trained lawyer, Silicon Valley venture capitalist, Never Trump pundit, pro-Trump senator, and vice president of the United States—all by the age of 40. On this episode, host and Vanity Fair editor in chief Radhika Jones is joined by executive editor Claire Howorth and Hive editor Michael Calderone to trace Vance’s populist ride through America’s power centers and how his right-wing ideology plays into a burgeoning constitutional crisis. They also discuss Vance’s role so far as Trump’s veep—and whether he has the political chops to one day land the top job. When Vance was first announced as Trump’s running mate back in July, liberals feasted on all the hullaballoo about his “ childless cat ladies ” comment and his Never Trump past. Some saw it as a rough start. But at the time, Howorth argues, Democrats were missing the forest for the trees. “I don’t think that the right was seeing that or laughing about that or thinking he was making gaffes at all,” she says. “I think he totally had followers then, and it was to the left’s own detriment that they thought it was all goofy. I think he is yet another avatar for all the young dudes who are looking for their masculine energy. And I think he really understands the intellectual game. He gets the ground game.” On the campaign trail, Vance eventually proved himself a formidable operator for Donald Trump, be it in media interviews , debates , and social media shitposts . As a canny writer and orator, Vance “is playing the lawyer to Trump’s showman and Elon Musk ’s bull in a china shop,” says Jones. “He positions himself as the one who is a scholar, who is, by comparison, restrained. But I’m starting to think that we underestimate the power of JD Vance at our own peril. And given that the vice presidency is sort of a joked about position—it literally takes a backseat to the presidency—I’m curious about how he will take that position and make something of it. He is, compared to Trump, compared to a lot of powerful Republicans, a young man.” Underestimated or not, Vance is clearly positioning himself as one of the future torchbearers of the MAGA movement—and one willing to buck all sorts of democratic norms to advance the cause. Case in point: Just this past weekend, after two courts ruled against Trump’s federal funding moves, he claimed, wildly, that “judges aren’t allowed to control” the president’s “legitimate power,” in what essentially amounts to giving the Constitution the middle finger. “When you look at the trajectory of the Republican Party, these are their ideas that the conventional establishment Republican Party probably would have thought were too wild,” argued Calderone. “JD Vance seems to be somebody who believes we should get ‘ wild ’ and see what happens.” More Great Stories From Vanity Fair Millie Bobby Brown on Stranger Things , Marriage, and Life on the Farm Chronicling JD Vance’s Circuitous Rise to Power : Listen to the Inside the Hive Podcast with Host Radhika Jones Smash ’s Dazzling Second Act The Education—and Anointment—of Barron Trump Secrets From the JFK Assassination Files : What Can We Expect?

Join today Future Perfect JD Vance accidentally directed us to a crucial moral question Just ignore the godawful reading of Christianity he used to get there. by Sigal Samuel Updated Feb 12, 2025, 4:00 PM UTC Facebook Link Vice President JD Vance speaks to reporters in San Diego, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Sigal Samuel is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic. Theology isn’t usually part of the job description for America’s vice president, but that’s not stopping JD Vance from giving it a try just a couple of weeks into his new position. In a Fox News segment on immigration, Vance laid out what he called “a very Christian concept”: “You love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country, and then after that, you can focus [on] and prioritize the rest of the world. A lot of the far left has completely inverted that.” When British politician and former diplomat Rory Stewart challenged Vance on X — calling his take on Christianity “bizarre” and arguing that we don’t need him telling us “in which order to love” — the would-be theologian, Vance, replied: “Just google ‘ordo amoris.’” That’s Latin for the “order of love” or “rightly ordered love.” It’s a concept found in the writings of Augustine of Hippo, one of early Christianity’s most important thinkers, and in the writings of Thomas Aquinas, a medieval philosopher influenced by Augustine. In Vance’s reading, “ordo amoris” means that there’s a hierarchy to our moral obligations: We should prioritize our family and our community over people outside our borders. There are a lot of problems with Vance’s drive-by exegesis of Christian texts. Pope Francis himself, in a recent letter to US bishops, refuted Vance’s interpretation and said “the true ordo amoris that must be promoted is ... the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.” The pope — like other bishops and priests who took aim at Vance — pointed out that the vice president’s “America First” approach runs against the dominant message of the Gospels, which is about radical love. It also runs against what Augustine himself actually said. We’ll get to that. But first, let’s recognize that this isn’t just an argument over religious texts; people can — and do — have much the same argument without invoking faith one way or another. In fact, Vance is capturing an intuition that is pretty popular among religious and secular people alike, as reflected in the contemporary cliché “charity starts at home.” And Vance didn’t just cross swords with any old online combatant. Stewart is an avid globalist, documenting a two-year trek through central Asia in an award-winning book and serving for a time as a deputy governor in Iraq. More recently, he worked as the president of GiveDirectly , a nonprofit that gives cash to people living in extreme poverty, no strings attached. In that sense, he’s an embodiment of the idea that we should actually be prioritizing strangers in developing countries a whole lot more than we currently do. Given that all this comes against the backdrop of the Trump administration’s anti-immigration push and its seemingly successful effort to destroy USAID , the government agency that administers foreign aid , this is really about a clash of worldviews. At the heart of it is a question that should be of genuine interest to anyone who cares about helping others: Is it right to put your local community first? Or do you owe more than you might think to total strangers living halfway around the world? Is JD Vance right about ordo amoris? First, let’s talk about the Bible. A big part of what made Jesus’s message so radical was that he did not advocate putting biological family or tribe first; instead, he imagined a new family of believers, which anyone could join. When Jesus was told that his mother and brothers were waiting for him outside, he famously said, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers? … Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” Another famous proof text is Jesus’s Parable of the Good Samaritan. The Jesuit priest and writer James Martin, who took to X to refute Vance’s claims , summarized the parable like this: To try to undermine this picture, Vance supporters have brought up texts from elsewhere in the Bible — like 1 Timothy, where the apostle Paul appears to prioritize helping one’s own family, saying, “Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.” But a little historical context goes a long way. As the National Catholic Reporter explains , in early Christianity, “widows, among the most vulnerable, became a litmus test for whether the church’s love could be more than abstract words. But there was tension — some families in Ephesus [then a hotbed of Christian evangelism] were neglecting their responsibility to care for their own, assuming the church would shoulder it all.” Hence Paul’s reminder that you can’t just ignore your own family’s needs altogether. We could spend ages investigating other scriptural texts — like when Jesus said, “Love your enemies.” But it’s actually more instructive to go straight to Augustine himself and ask whether he in fact said what people like Vance think he did. Here’s Augustine on ordo amoris : Further, all men are to be loved equally. But since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you. For, suppose that you had a great deal of some commodity, and felt bound to give it away to somebody who had none, and that it could not be given to more than one person; if two persons presented themselves, neither of whom had either from need or relationship a greater claim upon you than the other, you could do nothing fairer than choose by lot to which you would give what could not be given to both. Just so among men: since you cannot consult for the good of them all, you must take the matter as decided for you by a sort of lot, according as each man happens for the time being to be more closely connected with you. Augustine is not saying that your family intrinsically has a greater moral claim on you than strangers. Instead, he suggests that ordo amoris is a concession to a pragmatic limitation: “You cannot do good to all.” To understand how this works, he invites us to consider a specific scenario where the commodity you’ve got is one that “could not be given to more than one person” and where none of the potential recipients has a greater moral claim on you than another. What would be a scenario like that? Imagine that you’re sailing on a stormy sea, and you see two people drowning. There’s only time for you to save one. Both are in equal need and both are strangers to you. Augustine says the fairest thing would be to, essentially, flip a coin (rather than picking the stranger who promises to pay you handsomely if you save them, for example). In life, when we face the pragmatic limitation of “you cannot do good to all,” Augustine says that we can treat the accident of birth as the coin toss: I can save my own relative, not because they’re intrinsically more deserving, but because fate happened to make them my relative. But notice that this situation is not at all parallel to the situation Americans are in today when it comes to helping people abroad. This is not a “you cannot do good to all” scenario. The United States has so much wealth that it absolutely could do more for others. It’s the richest country in the world, and many Americans are in the global 1 percent . And money, thankfully, is a commodity that can be given to more than one person — you can just divvy it up. It’s not like the drowning strangers scenario, where you can’t help both and have to choose just one. America can help both its own citizens and people abroad — the only question is how much money to put in each bucket — and currently, less than 1 percent of the national budget is going to foreign aid. Finally, people in low-income countries definitely do have “from need … a greater claim upon you than the other.” Poverty in America is horrific and should absolutely be better addressed. At the same time, people living in extreme poverty in low-income countries are in even more dire straits. And money donated there can save and improve more lives (if it’s used wisely), because a dollar goes further abroad. So Vance’s attempt to map Augustine’s ordo amoris onto our current situation doesn’t make any sense. That said, it captures an intuition that many people share: Don’t we have a special duty to those near and dear to us? Completely apart from any religious debate, this is a question that modern philosophers have clashed over a lot as the rise of globalization has forced us to think about how our action — or inaction — might affect people we’re never going to meet. Related You can’t optimize your way to being a good person The philosophy of drowning strangers Utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer proposed a famous thought experiment : Imagine that a child is drowning in front of you. You see her flailing in a shallow pond, and you know you could easily wade into the waters and save her. Your clothes would get muddy, but your life wouldn’t be in any danger. Should you rescue her? Yes, of course! Walking past the child would be incredibly callous. But according to Singer, we’re all basically walking past that child every day by neglecting to donate to people in poor countries. Since we live in a rich society and giving up a little bit of our wealth wouldn’t substantially harm our lives, we should give to save the lives of the millions of kids who die every year from preventable causes. That argument has been very influential, both in the ivory tower and beyond. It helped inspire the effective altruism movement, which encourages people to donate as cost-effectively as possible — to give where their money can do the most good — instead of just donating to their local community or pet causes. It’s about doing good impartially rather than prioritizing your nearest and dearest. But Singer’s argument has also stirred up a lot of debate and confusion, as people who try to optimize their giving for maximum cost-effectiveness sometimes end up feeling callous when they ignore those suffering right in front of them. According to philosopher Bernard Williams — a staunch critic of utilitarianism — people are right to feel squeamish about ignoring those who are near and dear. In another famous passage related to drowning strangers, Williams said that if a man sees two people drowning, and one is his wife and the other is a stranger, and he pauses to consider whether rescuing his wife would maximize the overall good more than rescuing the stranger, he has had “ one thought too many .” Williams argued that moral agency does not sit in a contextless vacuum — it is always some specific person’s agency, and as specific people we have specific commitments. A mom has a commitment to ensuring her kid’s well-being, over and above her general wish for all kids everywhere to be well. Utilitarianism says she has to consider everyone’s well-being equally, with no special treatment for her own kid — but Williams says that’s an absurd demand. It alienates her from a core part of herself, ripping her into pieces, and wrecking her integrity as a moral agent. By extension, there is something reasonable in Vance’s claim that it’s morally appropriate to give preferential treatment to citizens of your own country. America is a democracy, and the prime responsibility of a democratic government is to respond to the needs of its citizens. But here’s the thing: It does not follow — at all — that America should gut foreign aid or keep out immigrants. Related I give to charity — but never to people on the street. Is that wrong? Foreign aid and immigration are not the reasons why some US citizens aren’t well provided for, and pretending otherwise is a distraction from government-enabled wealth inequality — which the Trump administration could address, if it wanted to, by raising taxes on billionaires instead of lowering them. The foreign aid agency USAID actually bolsters Americans’ own interests. And immigrants, we know, grow the economy , making everyone better off on balance. So, whether at the level of government or at the level of the individual, the real question is not whether to (in Vance’s words) “love your fellow citizens” or “prioritize the rest of the world,” but how best to divvy up the budget between them. There is likely no one objectively right answer to this question — a perfect formula that tells us the optimal allocations. Still, that doesn’t mean all splits are equally convincing; some will be a lot more credible than others. For the richest country in the world to spend less than 1 percent of its budget helping other countries seems, if anything, too low. Likewise, for Americans as individuals to devote less than 1 percent of our charitable giving to the most cost-effective charities out there ( which is what we’re currently doing ) seems somewhat absurd. Balance is important; this is not an argument for only ever giving abroad. But when you look at the data on giving, it’s clear that the scales are actually extremely imbalanced right now — they’re weighted almost entirely toward helping Americans. Against that backdrop, there’s a strong case for both the American government and the American individual to devote more to others. Or if you want to put it in religious terms: “You are all looking forward to greeting Christ seated in heaven. Attend to him lying under the arches, attend to him hungry, attend to him shivering with cold, attend to him needy, attend to him a foreigner.” That quote, by the way, comes from Augustine .

ESTABLISHING THE PRESIDENT’S MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN COMMISSION,EXECUTIVE ORDER,13/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/,"Establishing the President&#039;s Make America Healthy Again Commission &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ESTABLISHING THE PRESIDENT&#8217;S MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN COMMISSION EXECUTIVE ORDER February 13, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . American life expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries, with pre‑COVID-19 United States life expectancy averaging 78.8 years and comparable countries averaging 82.6 years. This equates to 1.25 billion fewer life years for the United States population. Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases. An estimated one in five United States adults lives with a mental illness. These realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations around the globe. &nbsp;Across 204 countries and territories, the United States had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in 2021, nearly double the next-highest rate. &nbsp;Further, from 1990-2021, the United States experienced an 88&nbsp;percent increase in cancer, the largest percentage increase of any country evaluated. &nbsp;In 2021, asthma was more than twice as common in the United States than most of Europe,&nbsp;Asia, or Africa. &nbsp;Autism spectrum disorders had the highest&nbsp;prevalence in high-income countries, including the United&nbsp;States, in 2021. &nbsp;Similarly, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in high-income areas such as Europe and North America. &nbsp;Overall, the global comparison data demonstrates that the health of Americans is on an alarming trajectory that requires immediate action. This concern applies urgently to America&#8217;s children. &nbsp;In 2022, an estimated 30 million children (40.7 percent) had at least one health condition, such as allergies, asthma, or an autoimmune disease. &nbsp;Autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States &#8212; a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the&nbsp;condition during the 1980s. &nbsp;Eighteen percent of late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease, close to&nbsp;30 percent of adolescents are prediabetic, and more than 40&nbsp;percent of adolescents are overweight or obese. These health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication. &nbsp;For example, in the case of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, over 3.4 million children are now on medication for the disorder &#8212; up from 3.2 million children in 2019-2020 &#8212; and the number of children being diagnosed with the condition continues to rise. &nbsp; This poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life. &nbsp;Seventy-seven percent of young adults do not qualify for the military based in large part on their health scores. &nbsp;Ninety percent of the Nation&#8217;s $4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions. &nbsp;In short, Americans of all ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively. &nbsp;These trends harm us, our economy, and our security. To fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct our national focus, in the public and private sectors, toward understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease. &nbsp;This includes fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety. &nbsp;We must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding existing data. &nbsp;We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease. Sec . 2 . Policy . It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively combat the critical health challenges facing our citizens, including the rising rates of mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. To do so, executive departments and agencies (agencies) that address health or healthcare must focus on reversing chronic disease. Under this policy: (a) &nbsp;all federally funded health research should empower Americans through transparency and open-source data, and should avoid or eliminate conflicts of interest that skew outcomes and perpetuate distrust; (b) &nbsp;the National Institutes of Health and other health-related research funded by the Federal Government should prioritize gold-standard research on the root causes of why Americans are getting sick; (c) &nbsp;agencies shall work with farmers to ensure that United States food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world; and (d) &nbsp;agencies shall ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention. Sec . 3 . Establishment and Composition of the President&#8217;s Make America Healthy Again Commission . (a) There is hereby established the President&#8217;s Make America Healthy Again Commission (Commission), chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Chair), with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy serving as Executive Director (Executive Director).

Sec . 4 . Fighting Childhood Chronic Disease . The initial mission of the Commission shall be to advise and assist the President on how best to exercise his authority to address the childhood chronic disease crisis. Therefore, the Commission shall: (a) &nbsp;study the scope of the childhood chronic disease crisis and any potential contributing causes, including the American diet, absorption of toxic material, medical treatments, lifestyle, environmental factors, Government policies, food production techniques, electromagnetic radiation, and corporate influence or cronyism; &nbsp; (b) &nbsp;advise and assist the President on informing the American people regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis, using transparent and clear facts; and (c) &nbsp;provide to the President Government-wide recommendations on policy and strategy related to addressing the identified contributing causes of and ending the childhood chronic disease crisis. Sec . 5 . Initial Assessment and Strategy from the Make America Healthy Again Commission . (a) Make our Children Healthy Again Assessment. Within 100 days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Executive Director, the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment, which shall: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;identify and describe childhood chronic disease in America compared to other countries; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assess the threat that potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures pose to children with respect to chronic inflammation or other established mechanisms of disease, using rigorous and transparent data, including international comparisons; (iii)&nbsp; &nbsp;assess the prevalence of and threat posed by&nbsp;the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify and report on best practices for preventing childhood health issues, including through proper nutrition and the promotion of healthy lifestyles; (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluate the effectiveness of existing educational programs with regard to nutrition, physical activity, and mental health for children; (vi) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify and evaluate existing Federal programs and funding intended to prevent and treat childhood health issues for their scope and effectiveness; (vii) &nbsp;&nbsp;ensure transparency of all current data and unpublished analyses related to the childhood chronic disease crisis, consistent with applicable law; (viii) &nbsp;evaluate the effectiveness of current Federal Government childhood health data and metrics, including those from the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and the National Survey of Children&#8217;s Health; (ix)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;restore the integrity of science, including by&nbsp;eliminating undue industry influence, releasing findings and underlying data to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, and increasing methodological rigor; and (x)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;establish a framework for transparency and ethics review in industry-funded projects. (b) &nbsp; Make our Children Healthy Again Strategy. &nbsp;Within 180&nbsp;days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Executive Director, a Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy (Strategy), based on the findings from the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment described in subsection (a) of this section.&nbsp; The Strategy shall address appropriately restructuring the Federal Government&#8217;s response to the childhood chronic disease crisis, including by ending Federal practices that exacerbate the health crisis or unsuccessfully attempt to address it, and by adding powerful new solutions that will end childhood chronic disease. (c) &nbsp;The Chair may hold public hearings, meetings, roundtables, and similar events, as appropriate, and may receive expert input from leaders in public health and Government accountability.&nbsp; Sec . 6 . Additional Reports . (a) Following the submission to the President of the Strategy, and any final strategy reports thereafter, the Chair and the Executive Director shall recommend to the President updates to the Commission&#8217;s mission, including desired reports. (b) &nbsp;The Commission shall not reconvene, following submission of the Strategy, until an updated mission is submitted to the President through the Executive Director. Sec . 7 .

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print Read More By&nbsp; MATT O’BRIEN , THALIA BEATY and KELVIN CHAN Updated [hour]:[minute] [AMPM] [timezone], [monthFull] [day], [year] &nbsp; Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print PARIS (AP) — OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman’s push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company. “We are not for sale,” Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris. Musk’s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology . “OpenAI has a mission,” Altman told France’s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. “We are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.” Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge. Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI’s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States. A group of investors led by Elon Musk is offering about $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit behind OpenAI, escalating a dispute with the artificial intelligence company that Musk helped found a decade ago. Here’s what to know. What happens next? RELATED COVERAGE Anger, chaos and confusion take hold as federal workers face mass layoffs OpenAI board unanimously rejects Elon Musk’s $97.4 billion proposal Hundreds march in Boston to support democracy and protest policies of Trump, Musk The offer complicates OpenAI’s plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders. OpenAI’s nonprofit board will need to consider Musk’s offer. It’s not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman’s approach and declared “OpenAI is not for sale” at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California. Taylor said Musk’s move was “largely a distraction” from the board’s fiduciary duty to its mission. As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, “our job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, ‘Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?’ And I have a hard time seeing how this would.” The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company’s assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk’s offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries. Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk’s offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission. Musk’s $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter’s board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose. “There is a legally binding purpose,” said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. “It is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.” The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board. OpenAI’s nonprofit complications OpenAI’s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is “(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.” The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology? “To make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,” said Horwitz. “And then to say once you’ve gotten big enough, ’You know what? We’d like to own this.’ That seems like a real violation of the promise.” Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018. Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk’s request for a court order that would block OpenAI’s for-profit conversion. The judge hasn’t yet ruled on Musk’s request but in the courtroom said it was a “stretch” for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn’t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial. Who else is backing Musk’s OpenAI bid? Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale. Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI’s current board “are intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.” Altman told employees this week that OpenAI’s structure “ensures that no individual can take control of OpenAI” and he has sought to characterize Musk’s tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up. “I think he’s probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,” Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris summit on Tuesday. Continuing their deeply personal feud, Altman said Musk is probably not a “happy person.” “Probably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,” Altman said. —- O’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island, and Beaty from Seattle. —- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.

Sam Altman wants to use Elon Musk's OpenAI takeover bid against him in court. Altman asked the judge in the tech bros' yearlong court battle to look at the bid letter. Altman says it shows Musk is contradicting himself when he fights OpenAI's efforts to go for-profit. Sam Altman, in a court filing late Wednesday, asked a federal judge to take a look at the letter Elon Musk sent on Monday in a bid to take over OpenAI for $97.5 billion . The request, filed with a federal judge in California, is Altman's latest move in fighting Musk's yearlong lawsuit seeking to halt OpenAI's transition into a fully for-profit entity. Altman argues the letter is relevant to that battle. His new filing asks US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to let him use it to show that Musk is contradicting himself when he fights OpenAI's efforts to go for-profit. He's asking Gonzalez Rogers to add the letter to everything he's already filed in fighting Musk's request that the judge halt that transition. Musk's takeover-bid letter was attached as an exhibit to Wednesday night's filing. In the filing, Altman's attorney told the judge that the letter was sent by a group of private investors, including Antonio Gracias and Gavin Baker, led by Musk in his capacity as xAI's CEO. The attorney, Jordan Eth, wrote that the letter ""purports to make an unsolicited bid"" to acquire all OpenAI assets. ""Musk's purported takeover bid cannot be reconciled with the charitable trust claim he is advancing in this Court, or the injunction he is seeking on the back of that claim,"" Eth wrote. Eth argued the letter showed that Musk had contradicted himself. In Musk v. Altman, the lawyer wrote, Musk is seeking an injunction barring any conversion of OpenAI into a for-profit enterprise. ""But out of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers,"" Eth wrote. ""Musk would have OpenAI, Inc. transfer all of its assets to him, for his economic benefit and that of his competing AI business and hand-picked private investors."" Asked for comment, an attorney for Musk referred Business Insider to his filing opposing Altman's use of the bid letter. In the letter, the lawyer, Marc Toberoff calls it ""entirely irrelevant"" and says it would distract from the issues at hand. Altman has been fighting hard in recent days against Musk's request that the judge halt what the lawsuit alleges is OpenAI's unlawful quashing of competition and its betrayal of its nonprofit origins. Earlier Wednesday, Altman's attorney accused Musk of having ""no facts"" to back up his claims . Altman has met Musk's takeover bid with a resounding no thank you, saying OpenAI is ""not for sale."" Also Wednesday, Musk said in a separate court filing that he'd drop the $97.4 billion OpenAI bid if it remained a nonprofit.

Vance met with a Holocaust survivor during a visit Thursday to the former site of the first Nazi concentration camp in Germany.

Around 41,500 were killed or died there from disease and malnutrition, while others were transferred to death camps in occupied Poland.

Musk’s attorneys outlined his position in a Wednesday filing as part of the xAI owner’s sweeping federal lawsuit against OpenAI, Altman and others. Musk has also asked a federal judge to halt OpenAI’s plans to restructure through a preliminary injunction. “If OpenAI, Inc.’s Board is prepared to preserve the charity’s mission and stipulate to take the ‘for sale’ sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid,” the filing said. Elon Musk made a surprise offer to acquire OpenAI. REUTERS The shocking bid from Musk and a group of blue-chip investors marked an escalation in his long-running legal war with OpenAI, which he co-founded in 2015 but exited after disagreements with Altman. It also marks a major headache for OpenAI’s restructuring plans, which were already seen as complicated due to a bizarre corporate structure in which a nonprofit board oversees the company. OpenAI has said the nonprofit will continue to exist but won’t be in charge.

OpenAI’s lawyers also claim that Musk’s offer to buy the company contradicts the original premise of his lawsuit. “In this court, Musk argues that OpenAI Inc.’s assets cannot be ‘transferred away’ for ‘private gain’….but out of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers,” the filing said. “Musk would have OpenAI Inc. transfer all of its assets to him, for his economic benefit and that of his competing AI business and hand-picked private investors.” Filed last year, Musk’s lawsuit names OpenAI, Altman, key investor Microsoft, billionaire Reid Hoffman and others as co-defendants. The suit alleges that OpenAI abandoned its original goal of developing AI to benefit humanity while transforming from a “tax-exempt charity to a $157 billion for-profit, market-paralyzing gorgon.” Sam Altman is attempting to restructure OpenAI as a for-profit AFP via Getty Images Musk also claims that he will suffer irreparable harm unless a judge grants an injunction stopping OpenAI’s restructuring plans. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who is overseeing the case, called Musk’s claims about irreparable harm a “stretch” but said she would allow proceedings to go to trial so long as Musk appears to testify. The judge has yet to rule on the injunction. Musk’s shocking $9.4 billion bid includes financing from prominent venture firms such as Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC, Valor Equity Partners, Baron Capital, Atreides Management and Vy Capital, and Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel. Musk’s attorney said his startup, xAI, could merge with OpenAI if a deal happens. Altman has also flatly rejected the offer while stating that OpenAI was “not for sale.” He also personally blasted Musk, telling Bloomberg that “his whole life is from a position from insecurity” and that he doesn’t think Musk is a “happy person.” “He obviously is a competitor,” Altman added. “I wish he would just compete by building a better product, but I think there’s been a lot of tactics, many, many lawsuits, all sorts of other crazy stuff, now this.” Filed under artificial intelligence elon musk OpenAI sam altman 2/13/25 Read Next Johnson &amp; Johnson halts late-stage E.coli vaccine tria...

The Department of State released a procurement forecast list which mentions a five-year contract - reportedly the biggest of 2025 - that could fall into Musk&#x27;s lap. 4 Musk introduces the newly unveiled all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck Credit: AFP 4 Elon Musk speaking to reporters alongside Donald Trump inside the Oval Office The initial version of the document released in December included an item called “Armored Tesla” with a five-year contract starting in 2025. However, the document was revised to remove the mention of Tesla Inc . after reports emerged about it on Wednesday. It now simply says $400 million worth of &quot;armoured electric vehicles&quot;. The contract is due to be finalized by the end of the year and is currently in the “planning” phase. read more on Tesla SHORT FUSE Billionaire reveals £90k Tesla suffered huge failure on ‘day warranty ran out’ WHAT&#x27;S IN A NAME Why Elon Musk changed his name to Harry Bolz on X However, given Trump and Musk&#x27;s newly forged bromance, one can expect Tesla to land the deal. While no specific car model has been announced yet, the huge government order is most likely to be for Tesla Cybertrucks, which can cost almost $100,000 with full specifications. Musk, who is known to be a huge fan of military and defence equipment, said in 2020: &quot;I just wanted to make a futuristic battle tank, something that looked like it came out of Blade Runner or Aliens.&quot; Although, Musk replied to a post on X saying: &quot;I’m pretty sure Tesla isn’t getting $400M.

Trump called Musk a liar and &quot;bulls**t artist&quot; during a rally in Alaska. &quot;Elon is not going to buy Twitter,&quot; Trump said at the time. &quot;You know, he said the other day, &#x27;I&#x27;ve never voted for a Republican.&#x27; I said, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t know that - you told me you voted for me. So he&#x27;s another bulls**t artist, but he&#x27;s not going to be buying it.&quot; In response to Trump&#x27;s critiques, the SpaceX founder clapped back. &quot;I don&#x27;t hate the man, but it&#x27;s time for Trump to hang up his hat &amp; sail into the sunset,&quot; Musk posted. Musk also went on to buy X months later. The X owner said he had previously voted mostly for Democrats since becoming a United States citizen in 2002. Musk initially backed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to be the Republican Party&#x27;s presidential nominee. &quot;My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist,&quot; Musk wrote on X in 2022. &quot;I had hoped that would [be] the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far.&quot; His shift in political parties might be attributed to his plummeting relationship with President Joe Biden who didn&#x27;t invite Musk to the 2021 White House electric vehicle summit. Despite their past issues, Trump and Musk&#x27;s relationship took a turn in March after they met at Mar-a-Lago. Trump was also previously against electric vehicles but has since changed his stance. &quot;I’m for electric cars,&quot; he said at a rally earlier this month. &quot;I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly. So I have no choice.&quot; Following the assassination attempt at Trump&#x27;s rally in July, Musk announced his support for the former president. &quot;I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,&quot; Musk wrote on X after the shooting. During a recent press conference, Trump spoke highly of Musk. &quot;I respect Elon a lot. He respects me,&quot; he said. &quot;Elon, more than almost anybody I know, he loves this country. He loves the concept of this country, but like me, he says this country is in big trouble, it’s in tremendous danger.&quot; Musk has been pictured at events at Mar-a-Lago and the UFC, buddying up with Trump. Trump selected Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency - a taskforce aimed at cutting bureaucracy. 4 Leader of Russia’s Chechnya region Ramzan Kadyrov is seen atop what is said to be a Tesla Cybertruck equipped with a machinegun in Grozny, Russia Credit: Reuters 4 California police department splashed out on a $150,000 Tesla Cybertruck Topics SpaceX Tesla Donald Trump Elon Musk North America United States YOU MIGHT LIKE RECOMMENDED FOR YOU MORE FOR YOU More from The Sun PARADE PANIC Two shot at Eagles Super Bowl parade as swarms of cops seen running to scene Share Latest DC TRAGEDY Black Hawk missed crucial message before DC crash because &#x27;key word was muffled&#x27; Share SAD LOSS Patrick Mahomes hit with second crushing loss just days after Super Bowl Share Exclusive NEVER AGAIN My son died in US&#x27;s deadliest high school shooting - how my pain saved others Share Follow The Sun Services Sign Up To The Sun About Us Editorial Complaints Editorial Standards, Policies and Ethics News Licensing Advertising Contact Us Help Hub Topic A-Z Cookie Settings Contact Preferences Sun Jobs Shopping © NEWS ENTERPRISES, INC.

Why are Elon Musk and Sam Altman engaged in a war of words over OpenAI,Al Jazeera,14/02/2025,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/14/why-are-elon-musk-and-sam-altman-engaged-in-a-war-of-words-over-openai,"Why are Elon Musk and Sam Altman engaged in a war of words over OpenAI? | Technology News | Al Jazeera Skip links Skip to Content play Live Show navigation menu Navigation menu News Show more news sections Africa Asia US & Canada Latin America Europe Asia Pacific Middle East Explained Opinion Sport Video More Show more sections Features Economy Human Rights Climate Crisis Investigations Interactives In Pictures Science & Technology Podcasts play Live Click here to search search Navigation menu caret-left Trending Russia-Ukraine war Gaza Donald Trump Occupied West Bank Narendra Modi caret-right EXPLAINER Economy | Technology Why are Elon Musk and Sam Altman engaged in a war of words over OpenAI? Two of Silicon Valley’s most prominent tech titans are at loggerheads over the future of the creator of ChatGPT. play video play video Video Duration 03 minutes 03 seconds play-arrow 03:03 Chatting with artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT By Erin Hale Published On 14 Feb 2025 14 Feb 2025 Two of Silicon Valley’s most prominent tech titans, Elon Musk and his former protégé Sam Altman, are in the middle of a very public feud over the future of OpenAI, the company behind the groundbreaking ChatGPT. Musk – the world’s richest man and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX – has filed multiple lawsuits over the past year to stop Altman from restructuring OpenAI from a hybridised nonprofit into a for-profit company. Recommended Stories list of 3 items list 1 of 3 Elon Musk-led group makes $97.4bn bid for OpenAI list 2 of 3 Vance rails against AI regulation in Paris as US faces off with EU, China list 3 of 3 Paris AI summit: Why won’t US, UK sign global artificial intelligence pact? end of list Earlier this week, Musk raised the stakes by offering to buy the nonprofit for $97.4bn to preserve the original mission of the AI research lab – ensuring that “artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity”. Musk’s proposal was quickly rebuffed by Altman. In the latest development, Musk said through his lawyers on Wednesday that he would drop his offer if OpenAI remains a nonprofit, which would prevent the company from accessing potentially billions of dollars in funding. Amid their legal stoush, the two men have publicly traded barbs attacking each other’s character. Advertisement So how did things turn so acrimonious between two of Silicon Valley’s most famous CEOs? What is the origin of the feud according to OpenAI? Musk, 53, and Altman, 39, were once colleagues. The two co-founded OpenAI in 2015 alongside several other prominent figures in artificial intelligence research. Musk and Altman served as the company’s first co-chairs. At the time, Musk, as the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, was a much more well-known figure in Silicon Valley. OpenAI began as a nonprofit, with a stated mission focusing on research and safety, rather than making money. According to OpenAI’s account, problems began to emerge in 2017 when it became apparent that it would need much more computing power and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding if it hoped to create artificial general intelligence. According to internal emails shared by OpenAI on its website, Musk allegedly wanted to switch to a for-profit entity with himself serving as CEO. As disagreement over the future of the company escalated, Musk is said to have withheld funding in retaliation. Musk left the company in 2018, according to OpenAI, but was initially still supportive of its work. He went on to acquire Twitter in 2022 and founded his own AI company , xAI, in 2023. In the years since Musk’s departure, OpenAI underwent major changes. In 2019, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary to help raise funds, turning the company into a sort of nonprofit-corporate hybrid. Three years later, in 2022, the company became a household name, along with Altman, following the release of the groundbreaking ChatGPT. Advertisement What is the origin of the feud according to Musk? Tensions between Musk and Altman began to escalate again in 2023 when Microsoft agreed to invest $10bn in OpenAI, on top of $3bn in earlier investments. Musk did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment, but his views on OpenAI have been shared in legal filings. Musk alleged in a lawsuit last year that OpenAI had become a de facto subsidiary of Microsoft, calling the deal a deceit of “Shakespearean proportions” and a bid by Altman to “cash in” on generative AI. Some of Musk’s concerns were, notably, shared by the United States and European regulators, who also launched antitrust investigations into the deal. Musk expanded his lawsuit in November, arguing the two companies were monopolising the market in generative AI. He alleged that Altman told investors not to back Musk’s xAI and other rivals during OpenAI’s latest round of fundraising and said that Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship needed to be unwound to “preserve what is left of OpenAI’s nonprofit character, free from self-dealing”. What have Musk and Altman said about each other? The two CEOs have pulled punches online, in the media and in court filings. Earlier this week, the pair clashed publicly on X following Musk’s offer to buy the company. “No thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want,” Altman wrote, using the X’s former name. “Swindler,” Musk wrote in response. Going on the offence in the media, Altman said in an interview on Tuesday that his former mentor was motivated by his own demons – rather than concern for the future of Open AI – and operated “from a position of insecurity”. Advertisement “I feel bad for the guy,” Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris AI Action Summit . “I think it’s to slow down a competitor and catch up with his thing, but I don’t really know … to the degree anybody does,” he said of Musk and his rival company, xAI. Musk, for his part, has portrayed Altman as a greedy and “unscrupulous” con man in his lawsuits against OpenAI. In court filings in August, Musk’s lawyers referred to Altman’s management of Open AI as a “hot-air philanthropy … long-con” and a “textbook tale of altruism versus greed”. Musk’s lawyers also alleged that Altman and other members of OpenAI “intentionally courted and deceived Musk, preying on Musk’s humanitarian concern about the existential dangers posed by artificial intelligence”. Why does OpenAI want to go private? Altman and OpenAI’s board argue that the company needs to be restructured to acquire its next round of funding from Softbank, a Japanese multinational, which recently valued the company at $260bn. While it is not unheard of for a company to switch from a nonprofit to a for-profit company – particularly in the healthcare sector – the scale of OpenAI’s endeavour stands out, said Rose Chan Loui, the founding executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits. Under OpenAI’s proposed restructuring, the for-profit subsidiary would compensate the nonprofit entity for its assets, creating a new for-profit company – but Musk’s offer of $97.4bn has complicated the deal, she said. “If a conversion is going to go through, the next challenge is determining what amount of compensation the nonprofit should receive. This should be fair market value. Previously, OpenAI reportedly was contemplating something in the range of $30-40bn,” Chan Loui told Al Jazeera. Advertisement “Elon Musk’s offer challenges the adequacy of that number. The nonprofit board will need to ‘consider’ the offer, and OpenAI will need to explain – to the nonprofit board, as well as to the attorneys general of Delaware and California – why Musk’s offer is not better for the nonprofit than what OpenAI is willing to offer,” she said. What does OpenAI say about Musk’s offer? Besides Altman exchanging barbs with Musk online and in the media, OpenAI has filed a motion to dismiss Musk’s lawsuit. In court, it has denied allegations that it tried to block funding to other start-ups and questioned Musk’s intentions. In legal filings shared with Al Jazeera, Altman’s lawyer Jordan Eth said that Musk’s “concerns” about the OpenAI’s future “do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers”. “Musk would have OpenAI, Inc. transfer all of its assets to him, for his economic benefit and that of his competing AI business and hand-picked private investors,” Eth said, according to a filing.

He said there is no place for “firewalls.” Vance met with Alice Weidel, the co-leader and candidate for chancellor of the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, his office said. Mainstream German parties say they won’t work with the party, a stance often referred to as a “firewall.” Polls put Alternative for Germany, or AfD, in second place going into the Feb. 23 election with about 20% support. News of the meeting came after top German officials pushed back hard against Vance’s complaints about the state of democracy in Europe, with the defense minister calling it “unacceptable” to draw a parallel with authoritarian governments. He and Chancellor Olaf Scholz defended German mainstream parties’ firewall. Vance said Friday at the Munich Security Conference that he fears free speech is “in retreat” across the continent. “To many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don’t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election,” Vance said.

It makes it possible for partly extremist parties like AfD to campaign completely normally, just like every other party.” He noted that Weidel was on prime-time German television on Thursday night along with the other contenders. But he added that “democracy doesn’t mean that the loud minority is automatically right,” and that “democracy must be able to defend itself against the extremists who want to destroy it.” Scholz posted on social network X to “emphatically reject” Vance’s comments. “Out of the experiences of Nazism, the democratic parties in Germany have a joint consensus — that is the firewall against extreme right-wing parties,” he wrote. Bavarian governor Markus Söder — a prominent figure in Germany’s center-right opposition bloc, which leads pre-election polls — told reporters that “we take every opinion seriously, but we decide ourselves with whom we form a coalition,” German news agency dpa reported. In a post on X earlier Friday, Weidel wrote “Excellent speech! ‘There’s no room for firewalls!’” Vance’s meeting with Weidel came after she was received on Wednesday by Hungary’s right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán . The vice president’s office said Vance also met Friday with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and opposition leader Friedrich Merz, while he met Scholz earlier this week when both were in Paris for a summit on artificial intelligence Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre took issue with how Vance urged European officials to stem irregular migration in Friday’s speech. Vance said the European electorate didn’t vote to open “floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants.” “He speaks as though we are not focused on immigration in Europe,” Gahr Støre said. “I mean, this is the big theme in every country, that we want to have control of our borders.” He argued that Ukrainian refugees accounted for a significant increase in unvetted immigrants in recent years — and they were accepted “because there is a bloody war going on, which he did not mention, which I think is not really addressing reality.” “I don’t agree with him that what’s happening in Ukraine, what’s happening in Russia, what’s happening in China is less important than the presumed loss of freedom of speech in Europe,” Gahr Støre said. ___ Moulson reported from Berlin.

OpenAI attorney William Savitt in a letter to Musk’s attorney Friday said the proposal “is not in the best interests of OAI’s mission and is rejected.” Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker nearly a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit. OpenAI has increasingly sought to capitalize on the commercial success of generative AI. But the for-profit company is a subsidiary of a nonprofit entity that’s bound to a mission — which Musk helped set — to safely build better-than-human AI for humanity’s benefit. OpenAI is now seeking to more fully convert itself to a for-profit company, but would first have to buy out the nonprofit’s assets. Throwing a wrench in those plans, Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a group of investment firms announced a bid Monday to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. Musk in a court filing Wednesday further detailed the proposal to acquire the nonprofit’s controlling stake. RELATED COVERAGE Anger, chaos and confusion take hold as federal workers face mass layoffs Hundreds march in Boston to support democracy and protest policies of Trump, Musk DOGE gets mixed reviews from conservatives who have long wanted major budget cuts Savitt’s letter Friday said that court filing added “new material conditions to the proposal. As a result of that filing, it is now apparent that your clients’ much-publicized ‘bid’ is in fact not a bid at all.” In any event, “even as first presented,” the board has unanimously rejected it, Savitt said. Musk has alleged in the lawsuit that OpenAI is violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said. He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including OpenAI’s business partner Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would halt OpenAI’s for-profit conversion . Musk also added xAI as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was also unfairly stifling business competition. A judge is still considering Musk’s request but expressed skepticism about some of his claims in a court hearing last week. —— The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . State attorneys general have filed a new lawsuit against Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The lawsuit accuses Musk of an ""unlawful assault"" on the federal government through his DOGE work. The suit also takes aim at Musk's access to the Defense Department, which has contracts with SpaceX. A band of state attorneys general has sued Elon Musk and President Donald Trump , accusing the tech billionaire of an ""unlawful assault"" on the federal government through his role as the head of DOGE . The more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general allege in the lawsuit, filed Thursday in Washington, DC, federal court, that Trump has given ""virtually unchecked authority"" to Musk in violation of the US Constitution . ""As a result, he has transformed a minor position that was formerly responsible for managing government websites into a designated agent of chaos without limitation and in violation of the separation of powers,"" the lawsuit says. Since Trump was sworn into office last month for a second presidential term, his administration, along with Musk, has wasted no time in its efforts to shrink the federal government . The attorneys general, from states including Oregon, New Mexico, California, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maryland, say they want the court to ""restore constitutional order"" and block Musk from issuing orders to anyone in the executive branch outside DOGE. They also want the court to declare that Musk's actions are not legally binding in addition to ordering him to ""identify all ways in which any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used, including whether it was used to train any algorithmic models or create or obtain derivative data."" Musk launched an AI startup called xAI in 2023. Lawsuit takes aim at Musk's access to Defense Department The Department of Defense is now among Musk's slew of targets as Trump has directed Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to investigate whether the Pentagon is wastefully spending. The lawsuit takes aim at Musk's access to the department, noting it ""has billions of dollars in contracts with Mr. Musk"" through his SpaceX company and others. ""The Defense Department relies on SpaceX to get most of its satellites into orbit and works closely with his companies on a variety of other initiatives,"" the lawsuit says, adding: ""This authority over the Defense Department, including its contracts, management of personnel, its funding decisions, programs, and systems, may only be exercised by a duly appointed officer."" Records from the federal site USAspending.gov say Musk's SpaceX had been awarded at least $6 billion from the Department of Defense since 2003. Musk and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. The Department of Defense declined to comment. The lawsuit alleges that Musk's ""seemingly limitless and unchecked power to strip the government of its workforce and eliminate entire departments with the stroke of a pen or click of a mouse would have been shocking to those who won this country's independence."" It says: ""There is no office of the United States, other than the President, with the full power of the Executive Branch, and the sweeping authority now vested in a single unelected and unconfirmed individual is antithetical to the nation's entire constitutional structure."" The attorneys general say in the lawsuit that Musk's ""officer-level"" actions are unconstitutional since the SpaceX and Tesla CEO has not been nominated or confirmed by the Senate. ""Mr. Musk is far more than an adviser to the White House,"" the lawsuit says. ""He executes the President's agenda by exercising virtually unchecked power across the entire Executive Branch, making decisions about expenditures, contracts, government property, regulations, and the very existence of federal agencies."" Attorney General Dan Rayfield of Oregon said in a statement, ""Elon Musk's attempt to demolish key government systems has thrown everything into chaos."" ""This power grab puts people's privacy and security at risk. No one should be able to mess with the systems that keep our country running,"" said Rayfield. Some of Trump and Musk's boldest moves have so far been challenged in lawsuits , resulting in judges either blocking or temporarily halting them.

Foto: Getty Images Iker Seisdedos Washington - 14 feb 2025 - 23:16 CET Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Bluesky Linkedin Copiar enlace Comentarios Sonó la campana en el último round del combate entre Elon Musk y Sam Altman, consejero delegado de OpenAI. El consejode Administración de l a empresa de inteligencia artificial (IA) tras el popular robot ChatGPT rechazó este viernes la oferta de 97.400 millones de dólares (94.500 millones de euros) que lanzó a principio de la semana Musk para quedarse con la parte de la compañía sin ánimo de lucro. El no unánime de los consejeros tomó la forma de una carta remitida a los abogados del hombre más rico del mundo, en el que le dejan claro que consideran que su plan para hacerse con el control “no es lo mejor para los intereses” de la firma. En el texto, el presidente de OpenAI, Bret Taylor, le hace saber a Musk que la empresa “no está a la venta”, y que ese rechazo unánime lo es también al “último intento” del dueño de la automovilística Tesla, la astronáutica SpaceX y la red social X, entre otras empresas, de “molestar” a su “competencia”. Queda así cerrado otro episodio del culebrón de la lucha entre dos viejos conocidos, Musk y Sam Altman, quienes juntos fundaron OpenAI con otros emprendedores en 2015. Las hostilidades empezaron el lunes, cuando el hombre más rico del mundo y el aliado más reciente y estrecho del presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, ofreció, al frente de un consorcio de inversores, 97.400 millones por hacerse con la compañía que dejó atrás en 2018. Al año siguiente, la firma, que creó una subsidiaria comercial para atraer inversores, aceptó la entrada en el accionariado de Microsoft, con 14.000 millones de dólares, dinero que sirvió para catapultar a la empresa. Altman respondió inmediatamente a la oferta en X con el siguiente mensaje: “No, gracias, pero te compramos Twitter [nombre que tenía la red social antes de su cambio de propietario] por 9.740 millones de dólares, si quieres”. Musk, que también tiene su propio negocio de inteligencia artificial, xAI, pagó 44.000 millones de dólares por Twitter en 2022, un precio que se consideró muy superior al real entonces. Al día siguiente, en un encuentro sobre IA en París, el consejero delegado de OpenAI reiteró su negativa en una entrevista con Bloomberg. Dijo que su rival “solo está tratando” de frenarles. “Obviamente es un competidor. Y me gustaría que se dedicara a eso creando un producto mejor. En cambio, ha empleado otras tácticas, muchas, muchas demandas, todo tipo de cosas locas y ahora esto”, añadió. Este miércoles, los abogados de Musk presentaron un escrito de tres páginas en el tribunal de San Francisco en el que su representado ha interpuesto varias demandas contra Altman. En él, insisten en los ataques al antiguo aliado , al que acusan de haber “priorizado las ganancias sobre la seguridad” y de haberse apropiado de la tecnología “manteniéndola en código cerrado, concentrando el poder de IA en manos de Microsoft”. La oferta hostil del dueño de Tesla complicaba considerablemente los planes de futuro de Altman, cuya criatura está valorada en 300.000 millones de dólares. El consejero delegado lleva meses diseñando el futuro de OpenAI, que pasa por renegociar el papel de Microsoft , lograr financiación adicional por valor de 40.000 millones de dólares y compensar a los consejeros de la parte de fundación de la compañía con una participación de una cuarta parte en la nueva empresa. Los 97.400 millones de dólares puestos encima de la mesa por Musk da a esos consejeros un mayor poder de negociación, y complica la tarea de Altman, difícil ya de origen, de contentar a todo el mundo. La justificación de Musk para presentar esa oferta hostil era su oposición a los planes de Altman de convertir OpenAI en una empresa comercial. Según el magnate sudafricano, esa búsqueda de lucro pone en peligro la humanidad y su capacidad de resistirse a los peligros de la IA. En uno de los juicios, celebrados el año pasado, Altman aportó documentos que probaban que el dueño de Tesla apoyaba el proyecto de convertir OpenAI en una empresa con ánimo de lucro, y que la dejó cuando vio que no iba a ser posible tomar el control sobre ella. La salida a la luz de esos mensajes hizo que retirara la demanda. Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo ¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?

Chip Somodevilla and Sean Gallup / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways OpenAI rejected a reported $97.4 billion takeover offer from an Elon Musk-led investor group. OpenAI Chair Bret Taylor said Friday the company is &#34;not for sale,&#34; after CEO Sam Altman rebuffed the offer in a post on X earlier this week. Musk and Altman founded OpenAI together as a nonprofit in 2015, and Musk sued OpenAI last year alleging Altman and others violated the company&#39;s founding mission. OpenAI rejected a reported $97.4 billion takeover offer from an Elon Musk -led investor group. OpenAI Chair Bret Taylor posted on Musk-owned X Friday that the ChatGPT developer is “not for sale,” calling the bid “Musk’s latest attempt to disrupt his competition.” Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI, an OpenAI competitor, is reportedly exploring a $10 billion capital raise that could push its valuation to $75 billion. OpenAI attorney William Savitt said the offer was “not a bid at all” in a letter to Musk’s lawyer Marc Toberoff Friday, according to a CNBC report. Savitt and Toberoff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had addressed the offer earlier this week, posting on X, “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Musk replied, “Swindler,” and in a post replying to another user added, “Scam Altman.” Musk and Altman founded OpenAI together as a nonprofit in 2015. The offer came after Musk sued Altman and OpenAI last year, alleging he and others had breached the company's founding mission by prioritizing profits over seeking benefits to humanity. On Wednesday, Musk said he would pull the bid if the nonprofit that controls OpenAI ended its plans to convert to a for-profit firm. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

In his first major address abroad, the vice president spurred officials at the Munich Security Conference to return to &#8220;the extraordinary blessings of liberty&#8221; that won them the Cold War &#8212; rather than crushing dissent, policing speech and infringing on religious freedoms. Vance , 40, also vowed that any leaders willing to join him and President Trump in the task would find &#8220;a new sheriff in town&#8221; ready to &#8220;fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square.” 3 &#8220;The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor,” Vice President JD Vance said at the Munich Security Conference on Friday. AP “The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor,” he told the officials gathered in Germany. “What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.” European leaders applauded the vice president when he invoked their shared commitments, but were less receptive to some of his more direct attacks on their nations&#8217; laws around speech &#8212; including the ban on some populist lawmakers from taking the stage at the conference. He also brushed off concerns from European leaders about tech billionaire Elon Musk engaging in their own political debates on the continent. Explore More Conservative influencer claims she had Elon Musk&#039;s 13th child five months ago Luigi Mangione releases first public statement since alleged murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Meghan Markle and Prince Harry paying big bucks to Dem operatives via their charity – sparking calls for a congressional probe “If American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg scolding, you can survive a few months of Elon Musk,” he said of the 22-year-old environmental activist from Sweden. “I believe deeply that there is no security if you’re afraid of the voices, the opinions and the conscience that guide your very own people,” he said, adding there’s “nothing” Europe can do for the US if it is “afraid” of its citizens. “You cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail,” he added, in a nod to Trump’s 2024 landslide victory. Vance pointed in particular to the cancellation of a presidential election in Romania, the EU Commission agitating to shut down social media posts deemed &#8220;hateful&#8221; as well as the persecution of Christians. Adam Smith-Connor was fined £9,000 for praying silently in protest outside an abortion clinic in the UK, he fumed, while the Scottish government warned residents near another clinic similarly against &#8220;even private prayer within their own homes.&#8221; &#8220;The government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thoughtcrime in Britain and across Europe,&#8221; Vance said. &#8220;Free speech, I fear, is in retreat.&#8221; The vice president acknowledged that the US under former President Joe Biden had also fueled this democratic “crisis &#8230; of our own making” by quelling COVID-19 dissent &#8212; while letting far worse actors gain a foothold through lax immigration policies. 3 A man walks near the site of a Russian missile strike, amid Russia&#8217;s attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine February 12, 2025. REUTERS “In Washington, there’s a new sheriff in town,” he said, borrowing a phrase bandied about after Trump&#8217;s return to the White House. “Just as the Biden administration seemed desperate to silence people for speaking their minds, the Trump administration will do precisely the opposite, and I hope that we can work together on that.” Vance also said there is “nothing more urgent” than countering the issue of mass migration that has come to Europe, which took on new urgency after an Afghan migrant drove through a crowded street in Munich on Thursday, injuring 30 people . “Almost one in five people living in this country moved here from abroad. That is, of course, an all time high,” he said. “It’s a similar number, by the way, in the United States, also an all time high.” “And we know the situation. It didn’t materialize in a vacuum. It’s a result of a series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world over the span of a decade. We saw the horrors wrought by these decisions yesterday in this very city,” he said, referring to the attack. 3 Vance accused European leaders of using &#8220;Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation&#8221; to suppress dissenting ideas. REUTERS “How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our shared civilization in a new direction?” he asked. In a rare point of praise, Vance singled out the Brexit movement for having been the only truly democratic response to European nations letting &#8220;open the floodgates to millions of illegal immigrants.&#8221; “Agree or disagree, they voted for it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And more and more, all over Europe, they’re voting for political leaders who promise an end to out-of-control migration.” In 2022, 5.1 million migrants came to the continent from non-EU countries — more than double the 2.4 million that entered in 2021. Russia’s war of aggression had also caused millions of Ukrainians to flee into Europe. Vance&#8217;s address offered no comments on the ongoing war between the two nations other than to say the US was negotiating for a &#8220;reasonable settlement&#8221; and that NATO nations needed to shoulder more of their own defense burden.

Breaking News Three Israeli hostages — including American dad — released after near collapse of cease-fire deal US News Trump, Musk accuse media, pundits of &#8216;trying to drive us apart&#8217; in preview of Sean Hannity interview By Victor Nava Published Feb. 14, 2025, 10:14 p.m. ET President Trump and billionaire DOGE chief Elon Musk accused the media and pundits on Friday of trying to create tension between them in an effort to drive them apart. “They want a divorce. They want you two to start hating each other,” Fox News host Sean Hannity told Trump and Musk in a clip from a lengthier interview that will air next week. Trump, 78, agreed with the Fox News host and revealed that Musk had already warned him about the media’s effort to sow discord. Donald Trump and Elon Musk will be featured in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox next week. Fox News “Oh, I see it all the time,” the president said. “They tried it, then they stopped.” “Actually, Elon called me and said, ‘You know, they&#8217;re trying to drive us apart.’ I said, ‘absolutely,’” Trump told the Fox News host.

Donald Trump has ceded control of the presidency to Elon Musk. President Musk will be attending a cabinet meeting tonight at 8:00,’” Trump joked. “And I say, it&#8217;s just so obvious they are so bad at it. I used to think they were good at it. They&#8217;re actually bad at it,” he argued. &#8220;Because if they were good at it, I’d never be president.” The pair mocked the idea of dissension between them. REUTERS Speaking directly to Musk, Trump indicated he feels strongly that the public can see through what he believes the media and talking heads are trying to manufacture. “You know what I have learned, Elon? The people are smart. They get it,” the commander in chief said. Musk agreed. “Yeah. They do, actually,” the Tesla and SpaceX founder said. “They get it. They really see what&#8217;s happening,” Trump reiterated. The full interview, which was taped at the White House, will air Tuesday, Feb. 18, at 9 p.m. ET.

They’re suing Elon Musk himself. A pair of lawsuits say that, with all the power he has accumulated, Musk is violating the Constitution’s rules about the appointment of federal officers. President Donald Trump listens as Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office at the White House, on Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. | Alex Brandon/AP By Kyle Cheney 02/14/2025 07:04 PM EST Link Copied Elon Musk’s efforts to disrupt and dismantle the federal government at the behest of Donald Trump have already sparked a legion of lawsuits. Now the legal challengers are setting their sights on a new target: Musk himself. Two new cases accuse the ultra-wealthy CEO of illegally amassing too much government power without the accountability typically required of high-level executive branch officials. They are seeking court orders that would force Musk to halt the cost-cutting and information-gathering activities he has been spearheading through his U.S. DOGE Service. The lawsuits rest on a provision of the Constitution that says powerful federal officers must be “established by law,” must be formally appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. Musk, of course, has not been confirmed by the Senate, and his role is amorphous and ill-defined. He has been operating out of the White House as the head of the newly created DOGE enterprise, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency but is not a formal government department. It was established by a Trump executive order, not by Congress. Many lawsuits have challenged DOGE’s early initiatives. But the two suits filed Thursday — one brought by state governments and the other by federal employees — are the first to take on Musk personally. “His power includes, at least, the authority to cease the payment of congressionally approved funds, access sensitive and confidential data across government agencies, cut off systems access to federal employees and contractors at will, and take over and dismantle entire independent federal agencies,” the government employees argue in a lawsuit filed by longtime Trump nemesis Norm Eisen. Similarly, the states say Musk’s little-understood role has stoked “mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees, and the American people.” U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan held a hearing on the states’ case Friday and agreed the states showed legitimate reasons for concern about the prospect that Musk and DOGE officials are improperly accessing or compromising federal databases. But Chutkan stopped short of ordering an emergency halt to DOGE’s access to those systems, saying that would be an extraordinary remedy that could only be deployed with specific evidence that improper action against another federal agency was imminent. A lawyer for the states lamented, “We’re playing Whac-A-Mole here,” and said it was hard to pinpoint where Musk would train his DOGE allies next. Chutkan acknowledged that DOGE has been rampaging through the federal government swiftly and unpredictably, but she said “bad things could happen” was not enough to justify an emergency restraining order. Musk — who is the CEO of X, SpaceX and Tesla, and is estimated to be the world’s richest person — has done little to illuminate his precise role in the Trump administration. His job appears to entail Oval Office meetings with Trump, trolling critics on X and assailing judges who have clipped both his and Trump’s early ambitions over questions about their constitutionality. Musk has attacked reporters for identifying the employees he has helped embed in many federal agencies. And he agreed to reinstate a DOGE employee who abruptly resigned last week after reporters surfaced racist social media posts he made under a pseudonym. (Court documents suggest, however, that the employee, Marko Elez, has not resumed his previous duties.) Trump has made clear he endorses what Musk and his DOGE team are doing, setting out in executive orders that the group’s mission is to modernize systems and databases across the federal government. The direct legal attack on Musk’s unappointed position will play out in courtrooms in Washington, D.C., and Maryland, where the two suits have been filed. But the issue could escalate as far as the Supreme Court and determine just how much power a president has to designate a roving budget-cutter to access the government’s most sensitive systems and databases. At the heart of the fight is the Constitution’s “ appointments clause ,” which requires most powerful executive branch officials to be confirmed by the Senate. Though department leaders can hire employees who don’t need Senate approval, anyone wielding executive power must face vetting by Congress. That principle was at the heart of a ruling last year by a Florida federal judge — Aileen Cannon — that derailed special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump for storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Smith’s role as a special prosecutor, Cannon concluded, violated the appointments clause — a ruling that contradicted a long line of judicial decisions upholding the authority of the Justice Department to name special counsels without getting Senate confirmation. Trump, at the time, celebrated the ruling and praised Cannon as a “brilliant” judge. Now, Trump’s detractors — who railed against Cannon’s decision in the context of special counsels — want to apply the same reasoning to Musk. But Musk’s role has no historical comparison. Never before has a president empowered a private CEO to come into the government and take a hacksaw to systems governed by intricate laws and policies meant to insulate them from political manipulation.

Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor in Munich Fri 14 Feb 2025 13.36 EST Last modified on Sat 15 Feb 2025 06.03 EST Share The US vice-president, JD Vance , has launched a brutal ideological assault on Europe, accusing its leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running in fear from voters’ true beliefs. In a chastising speech on Friday that openly questioned whether current European values warranted defence by the US, he painted a picture of European politics infected by media censorship, cancelled elections and political correctness. Arguing that the true threat to Europe stemmed not from external actors such as Russia or China, but Europe’s own internal retreat from some of its “most fundamental values”, he repeatedly questioned whether the US and Europe any longer had a shared agenda. “What I worry about is the threat from within,” Vance said. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, the vice-president had been expected to address the critical question of the Ukraine war and security differences between Washington and Europe . Instead, he widely skated over these to give a lecture on what he claimed was the continent’s failure to listen to the populist concerns of voters. Vance said of Donald Trump’s re-election: “There is a new sheriff in town.” He said: “Democracy will not survive if their people’s concerns are deemed invalid or even worse not worth being considered.” The blistering and confrontational remarks were met with shock at the conference and were later condemned by the EU and Germany , while drawing praise from Russian state television. They signalled a deepening of the transatlantic chasm beyond different perceptions of Russia to an even deeper societal rupture about values and the nature of democracy. Vance said: “If you are afraid of the voices, the opinions and the conscience that guide your very own people … If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people.” Accusing European politicians, and the organisers of the Munich Security Conference, of refusing to address issues such as migration, he urged a shocked and largely silent hall in Munich to realise they should not exclude politicians representing populist parties. In Germany, a firewall has long existed preventing mainstream parties from engaging with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland owing to its Nazi origins. But Vance said there was no room for such barriers. “People dismissing voters’ concerns, shutting down their media, protects nothing. It is the most surefire way to destroy democracy.” He described “old entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation” to impose censorship. Many in the hall were swift to say that Vance had still refused to accept that Trump lost the US presidential election in 2020, a refusal that ultimately resulted in a mob of the president’s supporters attacking the US Capitol. Vance said: “For years we have been told everything we fund and support is in the name of our shared democratic values, everything from our Ukraine policy to digital censorship is billed as a defence of democracy, but when we see European courts cancelling elections and senior officials threatening to cancel others we ought to ask ourselves if we are holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard.” Banning politicians representing populist parties was wrong, he argued. “We do not have to agree with everything or anything people say, but when political leaders represent an important constituency it is incumbent on us to listen.” JD Vance breaks taboo by meeting with leader of Germany’s far-right party Read more After the speech it was confirmed that JD Vance privately met the AfD leader, Alice Weidel , for 30 minutes. In a breach of previous protocol, he had declined the offer to meet the SPD leader and current chancellor, Olaf Scholz. His attack on mainstream European politicians drew a stern response from German and EU officials. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said he could not let the speech go without comment. “If I understood him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes,” Pistorius said. “That is unacceptable, and it is not the Europe and not the democracy in which I live and am currently campaigning.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said allies should be focusing on bigger threats such as Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. “Listening to that speech, they try to pick a fight with us and we don’t want to a pick a fight with our friends,” Kallas said at the Munich event. Kallas later invited EU foreign ministers to meet on Sunday to discuss Ukraine – and relations with the Trump administration . “The aim of the meeting will be to share information and take stock of the latest contacts with United States administration representatives and with Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference,” said the invitation to the meeting, which was seen by Reuters. The speech drew effusive praise on Russian state TV, where a correspondent, Asya Emelyanova, said on Rossiya 1: “It was very nice to hear Vance’s very strong speech. It was a public caning, I can’t call it anything else.” Some federal workers given just 30 minutes to leave amid Trump layoffs Read more In remarks that will delight the German far right days before elections there, Vance said: “Of all the pressing challenges that the nations represented here face, I believe there is nothing more urgent than mass migration.” His speech came a day after a 24-year-old Afghan man was arrested in Munich over a car-ramming attack that injured 36 people . Vance seized on the case to reinforce his point. “How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our shared civilisation in a new direction?” he asked. Instead, he claimed, “in Britain and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat”. He listed a string of cases that he claimed were evidence of this , railing against Romania for cancelling presidential elections and Sweden for arresting a man for burning a Qur’an in public. Britain was singled out for arresting a man praying near an abortion clinic. Attempting to underplay Moscow’s role in the rise of the populist right, he said it was wrong for Russia to buy social media to influence European elections, but “if your democracy can be destroyed by a few thousand dollars of digital media from a foreign country it was not very strong to begin with”. Before Vance’s speech, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, accused Trump and tech barons of being willing to destroy democracy. He said: “It is clear that the new American administration holds a worldview that is very different from our own. One that shows no regard for established rules, for partnerships or for the trust that has been built over time. But I am convinced that it is not in the interest of the international community for this worldview to become the dominant paradigm.” Explore more on these topics JD Vance Trump administration US politics US foreign policy Germany Russia news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Zelenskyy demands ‘real security guarantees’ before peace talks; Vance accused of ‘trying to pick a fight’ with EU – as it happened 16h ago ‘Thought crime’ and cancelled elections: how do JD Vance’s claims about Europe stand up? 16h ago Zelenskyy tells Vance Ukraine needs ‘security guarantees’ before any Putin talks 17h ago From anti-Trump to vice-president nominee: JD Vance in his own words 16 Jul 2024 Ukraine on ‘irreversible path’ to Nato membership, Starmer tells Zelenskyy 18h ago Labour rejects JD Vance ‘first Islamist country with nuclear weapons’ remarks 16 Jul 2024 Vance to meet Zelenskyy as European leaders call for unity over Ukraine 22h ago A Trump-Vance administration would be ‘the most dangerous’ for abortion rights, say advocates 16 Jul 2024 Ukraine war: Macron warns against ‘capitulation’ as Trump suggests Russia may not make concessions 1d ago Trump names Ohio senator JD Vance as 2024 running mate – video 16 Jul 2024 Most viewed Most viewed US US politics World Climate crisis Middle East Ukraine Soccer Business Environment Tech Science Newsletters Wellness News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints &amp; corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms &amp; conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top © 2025 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A fan made a detailed post explaining how to be &quot;Elon&quot; which included several &quot;side quests&quot; from buying Twitter to helping Donald Trump win the 2024 presidential election.

The SpaceX CEO and St Clair are not believed to have had a relationship together in the past. They have publicly had several back and forth chats on X across the years. One unearthed conversation from November 2023 shows St Clair telling her followers she has stopped using birth control to help with her mental health.

A decade later, Musk and popular Canadian musician Grimes, whose real name is Claire Elise Boucher, started dating before giving birth to a seventh boy in 2020. The child hit the headlines as soon as he was born after Musk announced he was called &quot;X Æ A-12&quot; . His name was quickly shortened to X with the cheeky four-year-old recently heading to The White House alongside his dad as they met up with President Donald Trump . X was seen playing around in the Oval Office, picking his nose and even having a stare off with the president.

Controversial billionaire Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa in 1971. As a 12-year-old child he taught himself computer programming and sold the code of a video game to a PC magazine for $500 (£300). At 17, he moved to Canada to study, before gaining two degrees in physics and business at the University of Pennsylvania. At the age of 24 he moved to California to start a Ph.D. in applied physics and material science at Stanford University - but left the programme after just two days to pursue other projects. Now 50, he is the founder and CEO of SpaceX , co-founder, CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors, co-founder and chairman of SolarCity, co-founder of Open AI and Zip2 and founder of X.com, which merged with PayPal. He&#x27;s also working on a human brain chip project called Neuralink. Musk&#x27;s stated aim is to reduce global warming and save humans from extinction by setting up a colony on Mars. The billionaire inventor is also working on the world&#x27;s largest lithium-ion battery to store renewable energy. 10 St Clair is a 26-year-old MAGA influencer Credit: X/Ashley St Clair 10 Musk with singer Grimes - the pair share three children Credit: AFP 10 Musk is often pictured with X Credit: Reuters Topics Celebrity kids Children parenting and family life Social Media SpaceX Tesla Twitter Elon Musk YOU MIGHT LIKE RECOMMENDED FOR YOU MORE FOR YOU More from The Sun Breaking FLIGHT HELL Jet2 plane makes emergency landing after passenger dies on flight to UK Share Exclusive &#x27;FOREVER 15&#x27; Mum&#x27;s heartbreak as &#x27;gentle giant&#x27; son, 15, dies suddenly Share &#x27;GUN&#x27; HORROR Woman is &#x27;shot&#x27; at pub on Valentine&#x27;s Day as attacker remains on the loose Share Exclusive DOPE&#x27;S WETAWAY Drug dealer got hypothermia after jumping in river as he fled cannabis raid Share Follow The Sun Services Sign Up To The Sun About Us Editorial Complaints Policies and Ethics Clarifications and Corrections Advertising Terms and Conditions Syndication Contact Us Help Hub Cookie Settings Contact Preferences Pay to Reject &copy;News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF.

OpenAI’s board ‘unanimously rejects’ Elon Musk’s offer to buy the company Comments Drawer News OpenAI’s board ‘unanimously rejects’ Elon Musk’s offer to buy the company OpenAI chair Bret Taylor said the company ‘is not for sale.’ OpenAI chair Bret Taylor said the company ‘is not for sale.’ by Emma Roth Feb 14, 2025, 10:27 PM UTC Link Facebook Threads Image: The Verge Emma Roth is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. OpenAI’s board of directors has responded to Elon Musk’s bid to buy the company. In a statement on X , OpenAI chair Bret Taylor said, “OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk’s latest attempt to disrupt his competition.” Musk and a coalition of backers offered to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion earlier this week. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman quickly responded to the news on X, saying “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Musk’s bid could still complicate things for OpenAI , which is in the midst of transitioning into a for-profit company . The board has to do what’s best for the nonprofit, and that’ll mean having to prove that Altman’s spinoff plan leaves it in a better place than Musk’s offer would have. On Wednesday, Musk’s lawyers said in a court filing that the billionaire will withdraw his offer if OpenAI agrees to remain a nonprofit company. Taylor suggested that concession was off the board. “Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity,” Taylor wrote. Correction, February 14th : A previous version of the article incorrectly quoted Sam Altman as saying he will buy Twitter for $97.4 billion. He said $9.74 billion.

Keeping Education Accessible and Ending Covid-19 Vaccine Mandates in Schools,EXECUTIVE ORDER,15/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-education-accessible-and-ending-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-in-schools/,"Keeping Education Accessible and Ending Covid-19 Vaccine Mandates in Schools &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Keeping Education Accessible and Ending Covid-19 Vaccine Mandates in Schools EXECUTIVE ORDER February 15, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose and Policy . Some school districts and universities continue to coerce children and young adults into taking the COVID-19 vaccine by conditioning their education on it, and others may re-implement such mandates. Parents and young adults should be empowered with accurate data regarding the remote risks of serious illness associated with COVID-19 for children and young adults, as well as how those risks can be mitigated through various measures, and left free to make their own decisions accordingly. Given the incredibly low risk of serious COVID-19 illness for children and young adults, threatening to shut them out of an education is an intolerable infringement on personal freedom. Such mandates usurp parental authority and burden students of many faiths. It is the policy of my Administration that discretionary Federal funds should not be used to directly or indirectly support or subsidize an educational service agency, State educational agency, local educational agency, elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education that requires students to have received a COVID-19 vaccination to attend any in-person education program. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) The term &#8220;educational service agency&#8221; has the meaning given in 20 U.S.C. 1401(5). (b) The term &#8220;elementary school&#8221; has the meaning given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c). (c) The term &#8220;institution of higher education&#8221; has the meaning given in 20 U.S.C. 1001(a). (d) The term &#8220;local educational agency&#8221; has the meaning given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c). (e) The term &#8220;secondary school&#8221; has the meaning given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c). (f) The term &#8220;State educational agency&#8221; has the meaning given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c). Sec . 3 . Ending COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate Coercion . (a) The Secretary of Education shall as soon as practicable issue guidelines to elementary schools, local educational agencies, State educational agencies, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education regarding those entities&#8217; legal obligations with respect to parental authority, religious freedom, disability accommodations, and equal protection under law, as relevant to coercive COVID-19 school mandates. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall provide to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, a plan to end coercive COVID-19 school mandates, consistent with applicable law, and including, as appropriate, any proposed legislation. Such plan shall also include: (i) a list of discretionary Federal grants and contracts provided to elementary schools, local educational agencies, State educational agencies, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education that are non-compliant with the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section; and (ii) each executive department or agency&#8217;s process for, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, preventing Federal funds from being provided to, and rescinding Federal funds from, elementary schools, local educational agencies, State educational agencies, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education that are non-compliant with the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party, held a &quot;Canada First&quot; rally in Ottawa on Saturday. | Andrej Ivanov/Getty Images By Mickey Djuric 02/15/2025 06:51 PM EST Link Copied OTTAWA — Canada’s Conservative leader used a rally in Ottawa on Saturday to deliver a message to Donald Trump. “Let me be clear: We will never be the 51st state,” said Pierre Poilievre, warning that he is prepared to defend Canadians against the president at all costs. “We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country,” he said. The populist leader had been long favored to win Canada’s next federal election, which could come as soon as spring. But the race has been complicated by the arrival of Trump and by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision to step down as soon as his Liberal Party chooses a new leader next month. Poilievre, who has appealed to Canadians by tackling complex issues with pithy slogans, used a Flag Day rally to reset his campaign in response to tariff threats that have scrambled the political landscape . Trump has pledged to slap Canada with 25 percent tariffs in response to a growing list of grievances. It started with complaints about what Canadian leaders say are small amounts of fentanyl and illegal migration entering the U.S. from Canada, but has since expanded to include banking, and the trade deficit. “We are slow to anger and quick to forgive. But never confuse our kindness for weakness,” Poilievre said about Canada. “We are mild-mannered and made of steel.” Poilievre had focused his “change” campaign on overturning Trudeau’s carbon policy. However since the start of Trump’s trade war a new ballot box question has emerged: Which Canadian leader will best defend their interests against the U.S.? At his “Canada First” rally, Poilievre tackled the question head-on, laying out his vision for the country should he become prime minister, while leaning heavily on Canadian symbols and its history. He promised to “end cancel culture,” restore national monuments and make it a criminal offense to deface them, to expand Canada’s military and to update the citizenship oath with more patriotic language. “Sometimes it does take a threat to remind us what we have, what we could lose and what we could become,” Poilievre said, pointing to an upsurge in patriotism. The Conservative leader said Trump has two options: Work with Canada, or lose it as a friend. As he defined the choices, Poilievre spoke directly to Americans, saying their “energy-hungry future” can not exist without Canada or its oil, gas and critical minerals. He argued that America’s defense is dependent on Canada’s North. “Carry out the unprovoked attack on our economy and your consumers will pay more and your workers will make less,” Poilievre said. “Gas prices will skyrocket. You will turn a loyal friend into a resentful neighbor, forced to match tariff with tariff and to seek friends elsewhere. Both our economies will weaken, leaving less money for defense and security and our enemies will grow stronger.” Federal and provincial leaders have been back and forth to Washington with the same message — that tariffs on Canadians will hurt Americans. And Trudeau has promised to hit back with counter tariffs on C$155 billion in U.S. goods. The rally was an opportunity for Poilievre to distance himself from Trump. In the hours before the event, Trudeau’s Liberal Party released a series of ads attempting to portray Poilievre as an importer of MAGA politics. In one ad, a split-screen features Poilievre and Trump using the same language from “everything is broken” to “fake news” and “the radical left.” Both leaders favor small government. They support a free market and cutting red tape, slashing environmental regulations, cutting international aid, and supporting more oil and gas production. Poiliere shared a plan to make Canada more independent and less reliant on the U.S. — a strategy that would draw on the abundant availability of energy for economic growth. He promised to spend more on defense, to diversify trade and to build more pipelines. “The option the Americans will choose is up to them. But let’s be honest, we have to be prepared for the worst,” Poilievre told the crowd at a downtown convention center. “Simply put, we can no longer depend on the Americans alone for our trade. We can no longer think of them as our backup defense.

( May 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Balaji Srinivasan Born ( 1980-05-24 ) May 24, 1980 (age&#160;44) Long Island, New York , &#91; 1 &#93; U.S. Education Stanford University ( BS , MS , MS , PhD ) Known&#160;for Former CTO of Coinbase Former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz Balaji S. Srinivasan (born May 24, 1980) &#91; 2 &#93; is an American entrepreneur and investor. He was the co-founder of Counsyl , the former chief technology officer (CTO) of Coinbase , and former general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz . &#91; 3 &#93; Biography [ edit ] He is the son of physician parents who immigrated from Tamil Nadu , India. Srinivasan grew up on Long Island , in Plainview , New York . &#91; 4 &#93; He received BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University and an MS in Chemical Engineering, also from Stanford. &#91; 5 &#93; In 2007, he co-founded genetic testing company Counsyl , which provided tests to prospective parents to screen for Mendelian diseases . &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; 3 &#93; &#91; 6 &#93; Counsyl was acquired by Myriad Genetics for $375 million in 2018. &#91; 7 &#93; &#91; 8 &#93; In 2013, he joined the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a general partner. &#91; 9 &#93; &#91; 10 &#93; In 2013, Srinivasan co-founded 21e6, which later became 21 Inc, &#91; 11 &#93; a Bitcoin mining startup raising over $120 million from investors. &#91; 12 &#93; &#91; non-primary source needed &#93; The company failed as a bitcoin mining business and pivoted to become Earn.com, which allowed senders to pay users in cryptocurrency to reply to emails. &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; 13 &#93; Earn.com was acquired by digital currency exchange company Coinbase in April 2018. &#91; 14 &#93; &#91; 15 &#93; After Coinbase purchased Earn.com, it became Coinbase Earn and Srinivasan became Coinbase's first CTO . &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; 16 &#93; &#91; 17 &#93; He left the company in 2019. &#91; 18 &#93; Coinbase shut down Coinbase Earn in December 2019. In April 2014, he co-founded Teleport, a job search engine. Teleport was acquired by Topia in 2017. &#91; 19 &#93; &#91; 20 &#93; In September 2024, Srinivasan started The Network School, a school for people interested in developing ""network nations"" and ""decentralized countries."" Located in Forest City, Johor , Malaysia , the school had an initial enrollment of 150. Students are required to have an admiration of “Western values,” to believe Bitcoin is the successor to the US Federal Reserve, and to trust AI over human courts and judges. &#91; 21 &#93; The Network State [ edit ] In 2013, in a talk at Y Combinator 's Startup School titled ""Silicon Valley's Ultimate Exit"" and in a Wired article called ""Software Is Reorganizing the World"", &#91; 22 &#93; Srinivasan urged the technology industry to digitally exit the United States and move abroad. The talk was received positively by Reason , &#91; 23 &#93; Wired , &#91; 24 &#93; and Bloomberg News ; &#91; 25 &#93; it was criticized by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal . &#91; 26 &#93; &#91; 27 &#93; After TechCrunch mentioned the speech in an article exploring links between Silicon Valley tech leaders and the far-right Dark Enlightenment movement, &#91; 28 &#93; Srinivasan wrote in an email to Dark Enlightenment leader Curtis Yarvin , ""If things get hot, it may be interesting to sic the Dark Enlightenment audience on a single vulnerable hostile reporter to dox them and turn them inside out with hostile reporting sent to *their* advertisers/friends/contacts."" &#91; 29 &#93; &#91; 30 &#93; In 2022, in a self-published book titled The Network State: How To Start a New Country , Srinivasan elaborated on his ideas about online nationality and the need to break away from geographical governments. The book describes the concept of a ""network state"" in which digital communities crowd-fund resources to build autonomous cities and states. &#91; 31 &#93; &#91; 32 &#93; The ideas in the book were inspired by the work of the economist Albert O. Hirschman , who sees two basic paths to reform, one called voice (remake the system from within) and another called exit (leave and build something new). &#91; 33 &#93; In an April 2024 article for The New Republic , Gil Duran warned against dismissing the Network State as an unpopular fringe theory . &#91; 34 &#93; His article drew from Srinivasan's September 2023 podcast interview in which he called for tech-friendly people to seize political power and take control of cities. Srinivasan said his plan would exclude Democrats from areas the techies control. He suggested bribing the police (with banquets and jobs for their relatives) to prevent them from enforcing laws disadvantageous to technology companies. &#91; 34 &#93; &#91; 35 &#93; Duran argued that Srinivasan's ideas reveal an ""appetite for autocracy"". &#91; 34 &#93; Public profile [ edit ] MIT Technology Review named Srinivasan on its list of ""Innovators Under 35"" in 2013. &#91; 6 &#93; In 2018, Fortune ranked him 26th on its ""The Ledger 40 Under 40"" list. &#91; 2 &#93; In 2017, the Trump Administration considered appointing Srinivasan as FDA Commissioner . &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 37 &#93; &#91; 38 &#93; &#91; 39 &#93; &#91; 40 &#93; &#91; 41 &#93; While being considered for the appointment, Srinivasan deleted all of his tweets, including tweets critical of the FDA. &#91; 42 &#93; In one such deleted tweet, Srinivasan wrote, ""For every thalidomide , many dead from slowed approvals."" &#91; 43 &#93; In July 2020, Srinivasan drew attention after criticizing Taylor Lorenz 's reporting alleged misbehavior of Away's CEO on Twitter. On the Twitter thread, he suggested Lorenz and activists like her are ""sociopaths"". Lorenz defended herself and characterized Srinivasan's previous actions as harassment on Clubhouse and other platforms. &#91; 44 &#93; &#91; 45 &#93; &#91; 46 &#93; &#91; 47 &#93; In April 2021, Srinivasan donated $50,000 in cryptocurrency to aid in Indian COVID-19 relief during a resurgence of the virus in the country . On Twitter, he pledged to donate another $50 for every time his post was retweeted, up to $100,000. &#91; 48 &#93; On March 17, 2023, Srinivasan bet James Medlock, a left-leaning economist, that one Bitcoin (then worth less than $30,000) would be worth $1 million in 90 days. Srinivasan made the bet after Medlock tweeted, ""I'll bet anyone $1 million dollars that the US does not enter hyperinflation ."" &#91; 49 &#93; Srinivasan conceded the bet early and paid an additional US$500,000 to bitcoin core developers. &#91; 50 &#93; Forbes remarked shortly after the bet was made that Srinivasan owns ""a considerable amount of bitcoin"" and his $1 million bet on Bitcoin ""might be a mere marketing ploy or even a pump-and-dump scheme"". &#91; 51 &#93; Ninety days after Srinivasan made his bet, the price of a Bitcoin was down roughly 3 percent from its March 17 price. &#91; 52 &#93; Personal life [ edit ] In 2020, Srinivasan moved to Singapore . &#91; 53 &#93; References [ edit ] ^ ""US, India &amp; China - Balaji Srinivasan Decodes the Geopolitical Dynamics &#124; the Ranveer Show 349"" .

I therefore direct the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to take all appropriate actions to make public, to the maximum extent permitted by law and as the heads of agencies deem appropriate to promote the policies of my Administration, the complete details of every terminated program, cancelled contract, terminated grant, or any other discontinued obligation of Federal funds.&nbsp; Agencies shall ensure that such publication occurs in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the underlying contract, grant, or other award.

Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies,EXECUTIVE ORDER,18/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/,"Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies &#8211; The White House Menu News Administration Issues The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies EXECUTIVE ORDER February 18, 2025 &nbsp;By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: &nbsp; Section 1 . Policy and Purpose . The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws. Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties. In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President&#8217;s ongoing supervision and control. The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people. This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, previous administrations have allowed so-called &#8220;independent regulatory agencies&#8221; to operate with minimal Presidential supervision. &nbsp;These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people. &nbsp;Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These practices undermine such regulatory agencies&#8217; accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law. &nbsp;For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people&#8217;s&nbsp;elected President. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials&#8217; accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of&nbsp;the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch. &nbsp;Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and&nbsp;final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the&nbsp; Federal Register .&nbsp; Sec . 2 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The term &#8220;employees&#8221; shall have the meaning given that term in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;independent regulatory agency&#8221; shall have the meaning given that term in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code. &nbsp;This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. &nbsp;This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;The term &#8220;independent regulatory agency chairman&#8221; shall mean, with regard to a multi-member independent regulatory agency, the chairman of such agency, and shall mean, with regard to a single-headed independent regulatory agency, such agency&#8217;s&nbsp;chairman, director, or other presiding officer. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;The term &#8220;head&#8221; of an independent regulatory agency shall mean those appointed to supervise independent regulatory agencies and in whom the agencies&#8217; authorities are generally vested, encompassing the chairman, director, or other presiding officer, and, as applicable, other members, commissioners, or similar such officials with responsibility for supervising such agencies. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;3. &nbsp;OIRA Review of Agency Regulations. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (&#8220;Regulatory Planning and Review&#8221;), as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;(b)&nbsp; &#8220;Agency,&#8221; unless otherwise indicated, means any authority of the United States that is an &#8220;agency&#8221; under 44&nbsp;U.S.C. 3502(1), and shall also include the Federal Election Commission. &nbsp;This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. &nbsp;This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.&#8221;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall provide guidance on implementation of this order to the heads of executive departments and agencies newly submitting regulatory actions under section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866. &nbsp;Agency submissions by independent regulatory agencies under such section shall commence within the earlier of 60 days from the date of this order, or completion of such implementation guidance. &nbsp; Sec . 4 . Performance Standards and Management Objectives . The Director of OMB shall establish performance standards and management objectives for independent agency heads, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and report periodically to the President on their performance and efficiency in attaining such standards and objectives. Sec . 5 . Apportionments for Independent Regulatory Agencies . The Director of OMB shall, on an ongoing basis: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;review independent regulatory agencies&#8217; obligations for consistency with the President&#8217;s policies and priorities; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;consult with independent regulatory agency chairmen and adjust such agencies&#8217; apportionments by activity, function, project, or object, as necessary and appropriate, to advance the President&#8217;s&nbsp;policies and priorities. &nbsp;Such adjustments to apportionments may prohibit independent regulatory agencies from expending appropriations on particular activities, functions, projects, or objects, so long as such restrictions are consistent with law.&nbsp; Sec . 6 . Additional Consultation with the Executive Office of the President . (a) Subject to subsection (b), independent regulatory agency chairmen shall regularly consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the directors of OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council, and the White House National Economic Council. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The heads of independent regulatory agencies shall establish a position of White House Liaison in their respective agencies. &nbsp;Such position shall be in grade 15 of the General Schedule and shall be placed in Schedule C of the excepted service. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;Independent regulatory agency chairmen shall submit agency strategic plans developed pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993&nbsp;to the Director of OMB for clearance prior to finalization.&nbsp; Sec . 7 . Rules of Conduct Guiding Federal Employees&#8217; Interpretation of the Law . The President and the Attorney General, subject to the President&#8217;s supervision and control, shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch. The President and the Attorney General&#8217;s opinions on questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties. No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes the President or the Attorney General&#8217;s opinion on a matter of law, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations, guidance, and positions advanced in litigation, unless authorized to do so by the President or in writing by the Attorney General. Sec . 8 . General Provisions . (a) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp; News Administration Issues Contact Visit The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 X Instagram Facebook WH.GOV Copyright Privacy",10030

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ENDING TAXPAYER SUBSIDIZATION OF OPEN BORDERS The White House February 19, 2025 &nbsp; By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 1. &nbsp; Purpose .&nbsp; The plain text of Federal law, including the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) (PRWORA), generally prohibits illegal aliens from obtaining most taxpayer-funded benefits. &nbsp;Title IV of the PRWORA states that it is national policy that &#8220;aliens within the Nation&#8217;s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs,&#8221; and that &#8220;[i]t is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.&#8221;&nbsp; But in the decades since the passage of the PRWORA, numerous administrations have acted to undermine the principles and limitations directed by the Congress through that law. &nbsp;Over the last 4 years, in particular, the prior administration repeatedly undercut the goals of that law, resulting in the improper expenditure of significant taxpayer resources.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My Administration will uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec . 2 .&nbsp; Preserving Federal Public Benefits .&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;To prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States, and to ensure, to the maximum extent permitted by law, that no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens, the head of each executive department or agency (agency) shall: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify all federally funded programs administered by the agency that currently permit illegal aliens to obtain any cash or non-cash public benefit, and, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate actions to align such programs with the purposes of this order and the requirements of applicable Federal law, including the PRWORA; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;ensure, consistent with applicable law, that Federal payments to States and localities do not, by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; enhance eligibility verification systems, to the maximum extent possible, to ensure that taxpayer-funded benefits exclude any ineligible alien who entered the United States illegally or is otherwise unlawfully present in the United States. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Administrator of the United States DOGE Service, in coordination with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall further: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;identify all other sources of Federal funding for illegal aliens; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; recommend additional agency actions to align Federal spending with the purposes of this order, and, where relevant, enhance eligibility verification systems. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp; Agencies shall refer any improper receipt or use of Federal benefits to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security for appropriate action. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec . 3. &nbsp; General Provisions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions 80th Anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima The White House February 19, 2025 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On the morning of February 19, 1945, the first wave of United States Marines landed on the island of Iwo Jima &#8212; commencing 36 long, perilous days of gruesome warfare, and one of the most consequential campaigns of the Second World War.&nbsp; With ruthless fervor, the Japanese struck our forces with mortars, heavy artillery, and a steady barrage of small arms fire, but they could not shake the spirit of the Marines, and American forces did not retreat. Five days into the conflict, six Marines ascended the island&#8217;s highest peak and hoisted Old Glory into the summit of Mount Suribachi &#8212; a triumphant moment that has stood the test of time as a lasting symbol of the grit, resolve, and unflinching courage of Marines and all of those who serve our Nation in uniform. After five weeks of unrelenting warfare, the island was declared secure, and our victory advanced America&#8217;s cause in the Pacific Theater &#8212; but at a staggering cost.&nbsp; Of the 70,000 men assembled for the campaign, nearly 7,000 Marines and Sailors died, and 20,000 more were wounded. The battle was defined by massive casualties, but also acts of gallantry &#8212; 27 Marines and Sailors received the Medal of Honor for their valor during Iwo Jima.&nbsp; No other single battle in our Nation&#8217;s history bears this distinction.&nbsp; Eighty years later, we proudly continue to honor their heroism. American liberty was secured, in part, by young men who stormed the black sand shores of Iwo Jima and defeated the Japanese Imperial Army eight decades ago.&nbsp; In spite of a brutal war, the United States–Japan Alliance represents the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. Nonetheless, our victory at Iwo Jima stands as a legendary display of American might and an eternal testament to the unending love, nobility, and fortitude of America&#8217;s Greatest Generation.&nbsp; To every Patriot who selflessly rose to the occasion, left behind his family and his home, and gallantly shed his blood for freedom on the battlefields at Iwo Jima, we vow to never forget your intrepid devotion &#8212; and we pledge to build a country, a culture, and a future worthy of your sacrifice. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

Purpose . It is the policy of my Administration to focus the executive branch&#8217;s limited enforcement resources on regulations squarely authorized by constitutional Federal statutes, and to commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome administrative state. Ending Federal overreach and restoring the constitutional separation of powers is a priority of my Administration. Sec . 2 . Rescinding Unlawful Regulations and Regulations That Undermine the National Interest . (a) Agency heads shall, in coordination with their DOGE Team Leads and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, initiate a process to review all regulations subject to their sole or joint jurisdiction for consistency with law and Administration policy. Within 60 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall, in consultation with the Attorney General as appropriate, identify the following classes of regulations: (i) unconstitutional regulations and regulations that raise serious constitutional difficulties, such as exceeding the scope of the power vested in the Federal Government by the Constitution; (ii) regulations that are based on unlawful delegations of legislative power; (iii) regulations that are based on anything other than the best reading of the underlying statutory authority or prohibition; (iv) regulations that implicate matters of social, political, or economic significance that are not authorized by clear statutory authority; (v) regulations that impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits; (vi) regulations that harm the national interest by significantly and unjustifiably impeding technological innovation, infrastructure development, disaster response, inflation reduction, research and development, economic development, energy production, land use, and foreign policy objectives; and (vii) regulations that impose undue burdens on small business and impede private enterprise and entrepreneurship.

Enforcement Discretion to Ensure Lawful Governance . (a) Subject to their paramount obligation to discharge their legal obligations, protect public safety, and advance the national interest, agencies shall preserve their limited enforcement resources by generally de-prioritizing actions to enforce regulations that are based on anything other than the best reading of a statute and de-prioritizing actions to enforce regulations that go beyond the powers vested in the Federal Government by the Constitution. (b) Agency heads shall determine whether ongoing enforcement of any regulations identified in their regulatory review is compliant with law and Administration policy. To preserve resources and ensure lawful enforcement, agency heads, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, on a case-by-case basis and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, then direct the termination of all such enforcement proceedings that do not comply with the Constitution, laws, or Administration policy. Sec . 4 . Promulgation of New Regulations . Agencies shall continue to follow the processes set out in Executive Order 12866 for submitting regulations for review by OIRA. Additionally, agency heads shall consult with their DOGE Team Leads and the Administrator of OIRA on potential new regulations as soon as practicable. In evaluating potential new regulations, agency heads, DOGE Team Leads, and the Administrator of OIRA shall consider, in addition to the factors set out in Executive Order 12866, the factors set out in section 2(a) of this order.

Purpose . In recent years, the gross domestic product of the United States&#8217; digital economy alone, driven by cutting-edge American technology companies, has been bigger than the entire economy of Australia, Canada, or most members of the European Union. Instead of empowering their own workers and economies, foreign governments have increasingly exerted extraterritorial authority over American companies, particularly in the technology sector, hindering these companies&#8217; success and appropriating revenues that should contribute to our Nation&#8217;s well-being, not theirs. Beginning in 2019, several trading partners enacted digital services taxes (DSTs) that could cost American companies billions of dollars and that foreign government officials openly admit are designed to plunder American companies. Foreign countries have additionally adopted regulations governing digital services that are more burdensome and restrictive on United States companies than their own domestic companies. Additional foreign legal regimes limit cross-border data flows, require American streaming services to fund local productions, and charge network usage and Internet termination fees. All of these measures violate American sovereignty and offshore American jobs, limit American companies&#8217; global competitiveness, and increase American operational costs while exposing our sensitive information to potentially hostile foreign regulators. My Administration will not allow American companies and workers and American economic and national security interests to be compromised by one-sided, anti-competitive policies and practices of foreign governments. American businesses will no longer prop up failed foreign economies through extortive fines and taxes. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of my Administration that where a foreign government, through its tax or regulatory structure, imposes a fine, penalty, tax, or other burden that is discriminatory, disproportionate, or designed to transfer significant funds or intellectual property from American companies to the foreign government or the foreign government&#8217;s favored domestic entities, my Administration will act, imposing tariffs and taking such other responsive actions necessary to mitigate the harm to the United States and to repair any resulting imbalance. In taking such responsive action, my Administration shall consider: (a) taxes imposed on United States companies by foreign governments, including those that may discriminate against United States companies; (b) regulations imposed on United States companies by foreign governments that could inhibit the growth or intended operation of United States companies; (c) any act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that could require a United States company to jeopardize its intellectual property; and (d) Any other act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that serves to undermine the global competitiveness of United States companies. Sec . 3 . Agency Responsibilities . (a) The United States Trade Representative shall determine, in accordance with applicable law, whether to renew investigations under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411) of the DSTs of France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, which were initiated under my Administration on July 16, 2019, and June 5, 2020. If the United States Trade Representative determines to renew such investigations, he shall take all appropriate and feasible action in response to those DSTs. (b) The United States Trade Representative shall determine, consistent with section 302(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)) (section 302(b)), whether to investigate the DST of any other country that may discriminate against United States companies or burden or restrict United States commerce. He shall further determine whether to pursue a panel under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the DST imposed by Canada and whether to investigate Canada&#8217;s DST under section 302(b). In making these determinations, the United States Trade Representative shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate. (c) The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall jointly identify trade and other regulatory practices by other countries, including, without limitation, those described in section 2 of this memorandum, that discriminate against, disproportionately affect, or otherwise undermine the global competitiveness or intended operation of United States companies, in the digital economy and more generally, and recommend to me appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable authorities. The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) (America First Trade Policy Memorandum). (d) The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall investigate whether any act, policy, or practice of any country in the European Union or the United Kingdom has the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or development of United States companies&#8217; products or services in ways that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise moderate content, and recommend appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable authorities. The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy Memorandum. (e) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall determine whether any foreign country subjects United States citizens or companies, including, without limitation, in the digital economy, to discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes, or has any tax measure in place that otherwise undermines the global competitiveness of United States companies, is inconsistent with any tax treaty of the United States, or is otherwise actionable under section 891 of title 26, United States Code, or other tax-related legal authority. The Secretary of the Treasury shall include the results of this determination as part of the report required in section 2 of the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal). (f) The United States Trade Representative shall identify tools the United States can use to secure among trading partners a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions. The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy Memorandum. (g) The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, shall establish a process that allows American businesses to report to the United States Trade Representative foreign tax or regulatory practices that disproportionately harm United States companies. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Principles and Objectives . America&#8217;s investment policy is critical to our national and economic security. Welcoming foreign investment and strengthening the United States&#8217; world-leading private and public capital markets will be a key part of America&#8217;s Golden Age. The United States has the world&#8217;s most attractive assets, in technology and across our economy, and we will make it easier for our overseas allies to support United States jobs, United States innovators, and United States economic growth with their capital. Investment by United States allies and partners can create hundreds of thousands of jobs and significant wealth for the United States. Our Nation is committed to maintaining the strong, open investment environment that benefits our economy and our people, while enhancing our ability to protect the United States from new and evolving threats that can accompany foreign investment. Investment at all costs is not always in the national interest, however. Certain foreign adversaries, including the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC), systematically direct and facilitate investment in United States companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies, intellectual property, and leverage in strategic industries. The PRC pursues these strategies in diverse ways, both visible and concealed, and often through partner companies or investment funds in third countries. Economic security is national security. The PRC does not allow United States companies to take over their critical infrastructure, and the United States should not allow the PRC to take over United States critical infrastructure. PRC-affiliated investors are targeting the crown jewels of United States technology, food supplies, farmland, minerals, natural resources, ports, and shipping terminals. The PRC is also increasingly exploiting United States capital to develop and modernize its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which poses significant risk to the United States homeland and Armed Forces of the United States around the world. Related actions include the development and deployment of dual-use technologies, weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional weapons, and malicious cyber‑enabled actions against the United States and its people. Through its national Military-Civil Fusion strategy, the PRC increases the size of its military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies and research institutions to support its military and intelligence activities. Those Chinese companies also raise capital by: selling to American investors securities that trade on American and foreign public exchanges; lobbying United States index providers and funds to include these securities in market offerings; and engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States capital and accompanying intangible benefits. In this way, the PRC exploits United States investors to finance and advance the development and modernization of its military. Sec . 2 . Policy . (a) It is the policy of the United States to preserve an open investment environment to help ensure that artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies of the future are built, created, and grown right here in the United States. Investment in our economy from our allies and partners, some of whom have tremendous sovereign wealth funds, supports the national interest. My Administration will make the United States the world&#8217;s greatest destination for investment dollars, to the benefit of all of us. (b) Yet for investment in United States businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, personal data, and other sensitive areas, restrictions on foreign investors&#8217; access to United States assets will ease in proportion to their verifiable distance and independence from the predatory investment and technology-acquisition practices of the PRC and other foreign adversaries or threat actors. (c) The United States will create an expedited &#8220;fast-track&#8221; process, based on objective standards, to facilitate greater investment from specified allied and partner sources in United States businesses involved with United States advanced technology and other important areas. This process will allow for increased foreign investment subject to appropriate security provisions, including requirements that the specified foreign investors avoid partnering with United States foreign adversaries. (d) My Administration will also expedite environmental reviews for any investment over $1 billion in the United States. (e) The United States will reduce the exploitation of public and private sector capital, technology, and technical knowledge by foreign adversaries such as the PRC. The United States will establish new rules to stop United States companies and investors from investing in industries that advance the PRC&#8217;s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy and stop PRC-affiliated persons from buying up critical American businesses and assets, allowing only those investments that serve American interests. (f) The United States will use all necessary legal instruments, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to restrict PRC-affiliated persons from investing in United States technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, energy, raw materials, or other strategic sectors. My Administration will protect United States farmland and real estate near sensitive facilities. It will also seek, including in consultation with the Congress, to strengthen CFIUS authority over &#8220;greenfield&#8221; investments, to restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence), and to expand the remit of &#8220;emerging and foundational&#8221; technologies addressable by CFIUS. (g) To reduce uncertainty for investors, reduce administrative burden, and increase Government efficiency, my Administration will cease the use of overly bureaucratic, complex, and open-ended &#8220;mitigation&#8221; agreements for United States investments from foreign adversary countries. In general, mitigation agreements should consist of concrete actions that companies can complete within a specific time, rather than perpetual and expensive compliance obligations. More administrative resources, in turn, will be directed toward facilitating investments from key partner countries. (h) The United States will continue to welcome and encourage passive investments from all foreign persons. These include non-controlling stakes and shares with no voting, board, or other governance rights and that do not confer any managerial influence, substantive decisionmaking, or non-public access to technologies or technical information, products, or services. This will allow our cutting-edge businesses to continue to benefit from foreign investment capital, while ensuring protection of our national security. (i) The United States will also use all necessary legal instruments to further deter United States persons from investing in the PRC&#8217;s military-industrial sector. These may include the imposition of sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) through the blocking of assets or through other actions, including actions pursuant to Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies), as amended by Executive Order 13974 of January 13, 2021 (Amending Executive Order 13959 &#8212; Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies) and Executive Order 14032 of June 3, 2021 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Certain Companies of the People&#8217;s Republic of China), and actions pursuant to Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023 (Addressing United States Investments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern). Executive Order 14105 is under review by my Administration, pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy), to examine whether it includes sufficient controls to address national security threats. (j) This review will build on measures taken under my authority in 2020 and 2021 and consider new or expanded restrictions on United States outbound investment in the PRC in sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, hypersonics, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, directed energy, and other areas implicated by the PRC&#8217;s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy. Covered sectors should be reviewed and updated regularly, including by the Office of Science and Technology Policy. As part of the review, my Administration will consider applying restrictions on investment types including private equity, venture capital, greenfield investments, corporate expansions, and investments in publicly traded securities, from sources including pension funds, university endowments, and other limited-partner investors. It is past time for American universities to stop supporting foreign adversaries with their investment decisions, much as they should stop granting university access to supporters of terrorism. (k) To further reduce incentives for United States persons to invest in our foreign adversaries, we will review whether to suspend or terminate the 1984 United States-The People&#8217;s Republic of China Income Tax Convention. That tax treaty, along with the PRC&#8217;s admission to the World Trade Organization and the related undertaking by the United States to accord unconditional Most Favored Nation treatment to goods and services of the PRC, led to the deindustrialization of the United States and the technological modernization of the PRC military. We will seek to reverse both those trends. United States investors will invest in the future of America, not the future of the PRC. (l) To protect the savings of United States investors and channel them into American growth and prosperity, my Administration will also: (i) determine if adequate financial auditing standards are upheld for companies covered by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act; (ii) review the variable interest entity and subsidiary structures used by foreign-adversary companies to trade on United States exchanges, which limit the ownership rights and protections for United States investors, as well as allegations of fraudulent behavior by these companies; and (iii) restore the highest fiduciary standards as required by the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, seeking to ensure that foreign adversary companies are ineligible for pension plan contributions. Sec . 3 . Implementation . The policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum shall be implemented, to the extent permitted by law and available appropriations, and subject to internal programmatic and budgetary processes, as follows: (a) With respect to sections 2(a) through 2(k) of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to the authorities of CFIUS in coordination with the members thereof, shall take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, to support all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and other statutes to carry out the purposes of this memorandum. (b) With respect to section 2(d) of this memorandum, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall carry out the purposes of this memorandum.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY FROM IMPORTS OF COPPER The White House February 25, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended ( 19 U.S.C. 1862 ) (Trade Expansion Act), it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Policy . Copper is a critical material essential to the national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience of the United States. Copper, scrap copper, and copper&#8217;s derivative products play a vital role in defense applications, infrastructure, and emerging technologies, including clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics. The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain, with increasing reliance on foreign sources for mined, smelted, and refined copper. The United States has ample copper reserves, yet our smelting and refining capacity lags significantly behind global competitors. A single foreign producer dominates global copper smelting and refining, controlling over 50 percent of global smelting capacity and holding four of the top five largest refining facilities. This dominance, coupled with global overcapacity and a single producer&#8217;s control of world supply chains, poses a direct threat to United States national security and economic stability. It is the policy of the United States to ensure a reliable, secure, and resilient domestic copper supply chain. The United States&#8217; increasing dependence on foreign sources of copper, particularly from a concentrated number of supplier nations, along with the risk of foreign market manipulation, necessitate action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine whether imports of copper, scrap copper, and copper&#8217;s derivative products threaten to impair national security. Sec . 2 . Investigation Into the National Security Impact of Copper Imports . (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine the effects on national security of imports of copper in all forms, including but not limited to: (i) raw mined copper; (ii) copper concentrates; (iii) refined copper; (iv) copper alloys; (v) scrap copper; and (vi) derivative products. (b) In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled &#8220;Domestic production for national defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,&#8221; as well as other relevant factors, including: (i) the current and projected demand for copper in United States defense, energy, and critical infrastructure sectors; (ii) the extent to which domestic production, smelting, refining, and recycling can meet demand; (iii) the role of foreign supply chains, particularly from major exporters, in meeting United States demand; (iv) the concentration of United States copper imports from a small number of suppliers and the associated risks; (v) the impact of foreign government subsidies, overcapacity, and predatory trade practices on United States industry competitiveness; (vi) the economic impact of artificially suppressed copper prices due to dumping and state-sponsored overproduction; (vii) the potential for export restrictions by foreign nations, including the ability of foreign nations to weaponize their control over refined copper supplies; (viii) the feasibility of increasing domestic copper mining, smelting, and refining capacity to reduce import reliance; and (ix) the impact of current trade policies on domestic copper production and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security. Sec . 3 . Required Actions . (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with copper import dependency. (b) Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that includes: (i) findings on whether United States dependence on copper imports threatens national security; (ii) recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and (iii) policy recommendations for strengthening the United States copper supply chain through strategic investments, permitting reforms, and enhanced recycling initiatives. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

"Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information",EXECUTIVE ORDER,25/02/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/making-america-healthy-again-by-empowering-patients-with-clear-accurate-and-actionable-healthcare-pricing-information/,"Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information The White House February 25, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . During my first term, my Administration took historic steps to correct a fundamental wrong within the American healthcare system. For far too long, prices were hidden from patients and employers, with inadequate recourse available to individuals looking to shop for care or obtain pricing information from a healthcare provider in advance of a visit or procedure. These opaque pricing arrangements allowed powerful entities, such as hospitals and insurance companies, to operate with insufficient accountability regarding their pricing practices, resulting in patients, employers, and taxpayers shouldering the burden of inflated healthcare costs. Pursuant to Executive Order 13877 of June 24, 2019 (Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First), my Administration issued paradigm-shifting regulations to put patients first by requiring hospitals and health plans to deliver meaningful price information to the American people. These regulations require hospitals to maintain a consumer-friendly display of pricing information for up to 300 shoppable services and a machine-readable file with negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides; health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can access price information. One economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025. Another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services. Recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term. Unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the Federal level has stalled since the end of my first term. Hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all. The Biden Administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my Administration&#8217;s requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs. The American people deserve better. Making America healthy again will require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices. By building on the historic efforts of my first term, my Administration will make more meaningful price information available to patients to support a more competitive, innovative, affordable, and higher quality healthcare system. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to put patients first and ensure they have the information they need to make well-informed healthcare decisions. The Federal Government will continue to promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices and will take all necessary steps to improve existing price transparency requirements; increase enforcement of price transparency requirements; and identify opportunities to further empower patients with meaningful price information, potentially including through the expansion of existing price transparency requirements. Sec . 3 . Fulfilling the Promise of Radical Transparency . The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take all necessary and appropriate action to rapidly implement and enforce the healthcare price transparency regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 13877, including, within 90 days of the date of this order, action to: (a) require the disclosure of the actual prices of items and services, not estimates; (b) issue updated guidance or proposed regulatory action ensuring pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across hospitals and health plans; and (c) issue guidance or proposed regulatory action updating enforcement policies designed to ensure compliance with the transparent reporting of complete, accurate, and meaningful data. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

In the 1990s, Land was closely affiliated with the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), a ""theory-fiction"" collective co-founded by Land and cyberfeminist philosopher Sadie Plant at the University of Warwick . &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 7 &#93; During this era, Land drew inspiration from post-structuralist theory and leftist thinkers such as Bataille , Marx , and Deleuze &amp; Guatarri as well as science fiction , rave culture , and the occult . &#91; 8 &#93; He also coined the term "" hyperstition "" to refer to memetic ideas which bring about their own reality. &#91; 9 &#93; Land resigned from Warwick in 1998. Following a period of amphetamine abuse, he suffered a breakdown in the early 2000s and subsequently moved to Asia . &#91; 10 &#93; After several years, he remerged as a figure on the political right , becoming a founding thinker in the neo-reactionary movement known as the Dark Enlightenment . His related writing has explored anti-egalitarian and anti-democratic ideas. Biography [ edit ] Land obtained a PhD in 1987 in the University of Essex under David Farrell Krell , with a thesis on Heidegger's 1953 essay Die Sprache im Gedicht , which is about Georg Trakl 's work. &#91; 11 &#93; He began as a lecturer in Continental philosophy at the University of Warwick from 1987 until his resignation in 1998. &#91; 5 &#93; In 1992, he published The Thirst for Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism . &#91; 12 &#93; Land published an abundance of shorter texts, many in the 1990s during his time with the CCRU. &#91; 6 &#93; The majority of these articles were compiled in the retrospective collection Fanged Noumena , published in 2011. At Warwick, Land and Sadie Plant co-founded the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), an interdisciplinary research group described by philosopher Graham Harman as ""a diverse group of thinkers who experimented in conceptual production by welding together a wide variety of sources: futurism , technoscience , philosophy , mysticism , numerology , complexity theory, and science fiction , among others"". &#91; 13 &#93; During his time at Warwick, Land participated in Virtual Futures, a series of cyber-culture conferences. Virtual Futures 96 was advertised as ""an anti-disciplinary event"" and ""a conference in the post-humanities"". One session involved Nick Land ""lying on the ground, croaking into a mic"", recalls Robin Mackay, while Mackay played jungle records in the background."" &#91; 14 &#93; He was also the thesis advisor of some PhD students. &#91; 15 &#93; Following his resignation, the CCRU continued meeting under his leadership. In the early 2000s, Land suffered a breakdown after a period of ""fanatical"" amphetamine abuse. &#91; 16 &#93; Land taught at the New Centre for Research &amp; Practice until March 2017, when the Centre ended its relationship with him ""following several tweets by Land this year in which he espoused intolerant opinions about Muslims and immigrants"". &#91; 17 &#93; As of 2017 &#91;update&#93; , Land resided in Shanghai . &#91; 18 &#93; Concepts and influence [ edit ] Transhumanism Issues Accelerating change Eradication of suffering Fourth Industrial Revolution Human enhancement Genetic Moral Neuro- Cognitive liberty New eugenics Eugenics Human nature Meliorism Post-politics Post-scarcity People Andrews Bostrom Church Drexler Freitas Fyodorov Fahy FM-2030 Fuller de Garis Gasson Goertzel de Grey Haldane Hanson Harari Harbisson Harris Huxley Hughes Istvan Land Kurzweil More Osborn Pearce Stolyarov Sandberg Savulescu Sorgner Spencer Stock Teilhard de Chardin Vita-More Warwick Influential works Oration on the Dignity of Man (1486) Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883) Looking Backward (1888) The Will to Power (~1901) Daedalus (1924) La raza cósmica (1925) The Phenomenon of Man (1955) The Dialectic of Sex (1970) Metaman (1993) The Hedonistic Imperative (1995) Regeln für den Menschenpark (1997) The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999) Citizen Cyborg (2004) The Singularity Is Near (2005) Human Enhancement (2009) Fanged Noumena (2011) The Transhumanist Wager (2013) Sapiens (2014) Homo Deus (2015) The Transhumanist Bill of Rights (2015) The Age of Em (2016) The Precipice (2020) What We Owe the Future (2022) "" Techno-Optimist Manifesto "" (2023) Variants Accelerationism Effective Cypherpunk Dataism Extropianism Immortalism Longtermism Postgenderism Posthumanism Russian Cosmism Singularitarianism Technogaianism Technolibertarianism Technological utopianism Techno-progressivism Related topics Dyson sphere Technologies Emerging Disruptive Hypothetical v t e Early work [ edit ] Land's work with CCRU, as well as his pre-Dark Enlightenment writings, have all been influential to the political philosophy of accelerationism , an idea resembling that of the ""fatal strategy"" of ""ecstasy"" in the earlier work of Jean Baudrillard , where ""a system is abolished only by pushing it into hyperlogic, by forcing it into an excessive practice which is equivalent to a brutal amortization."" Along with the other members of CCRU, Land wove together ideas from the occult , cybernetics , science fiction, and poststructuralist philosophy to try to describe the phenomena of techno-capitalist acceleration. Land coined the term ""hyperstition"", a portmanteau of ""superstition"" and ""hyper"", to describe something which ""is equipoised between fiction and technology"". &#91; 19 &#93; According to Land, hyperstitions are ideas that, by their very existence as ideas, bring about their own reality. &#91; 9 &#93; Later work [ edit ] Land's Dark Enlightenment philosophy (also known as neo-reactionary movement and abbreviated NRx) opposes egalitarianism . According to reporter Dylan Matthews , Land believes democracy restricts accountability and freedom. &#91; 20 &#93; Shuja Haider notes, ""His sequence of essays setting out its principles have become the foundation of the NRx canon."" &#91; 19 &#93; His writing has variously discussed themes of scientific racism and eugenics , or what he briefly called ""hyper-racism"". &#91; 21 &#93; &#91; 22 &#93; &#91; 23 &#93; &#91; 24 &#93; Land's current version of accelerationism incorporates explicitly racist views; since late 2016, he has increasingly been recognised as an inspiration for the alt-right . &#91; 25 &#93; Land disputes that the NRx is a movement, and defines the alt-right as distinct from the NRx. &#91; 26 &#93; Reception and influence [ edit ] Mark Fisher , a British cultural theorist and student of Land's, argued in 2011 that Land's greatest impact so far had been on music and art, rather than on philosophy. The musician Kode9 , the artist Jake Chapman , and others studied with or describe their influence by Land, often highlighting Land's inhuman, ""technilist,"" or ""delirious"" qualities. Fisher underscores in particular how Land's personality during the 1990s could catalyze changes in those engaging with his work through what Kodwo Eshun describes as a manner ""immediately open, egalitarian, and absolutely unaffected by academic protocol"" which could dramatise ""theory as a geopolitico- historical epic ."" &#91; 6 &#93; Nihilist philosopher Ray Brassier , also formerly from the University of Warwick , stated in 2017 that ""Nick Land has gone from arguing 'Politics is dead', 20 years ago, to this completely old-fashioned, standard reactionary stuff."" &#91; 27 &#93; Books [ edit ] Heidegger's 'Die Sprache im Gedicht' and the Cultivation of the Grapheme Archived 31 October 2020 at the Wayback Machine (PhD Thesis, University of Essex, 1987) The Thirst For Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism (An Essay in Atheistic Religion) (London and New York: Routledge, 1992) Machinic Postmodernism: Complexity, Technics and Regulation (with Keith Ansell-Pearson &amp; Joseph A.

"Democratic Insiders Are Sharing A Warning About Curtis Yarvin, Elon Musk & Neoreactionaries",Substack,2025-02-26,https://shatterzone.substack.com/p/democratic-insiders-are-sharing-a,"Democratic Insiders Are Sharing A Warning About Curtis Yarvin, Elon Musk &amp; Neoreactionaries Shatter Zone Subscribe Sign in Share this post Shatter Zone Democratic Insiders Are Sharing A Warning About Curtis Yarvin, Elon Musk &amp; Neoreactionaries Copy link Facebook Email Notes More Democratic Insiders Are Sharing A Warning About Curtis Yarvin, Elon Musk &amp; Neoreactionaries DNC employees and think tank workers are spreading a document about the Neoreactionary threat to democracy The Only Robert Evans Feb 26, 2025 441 Share this post Shatter Zone Democratic Insiders Are Sharing A Warning About Curtis Yarvin, Elon Musk &amp; Neoreactionaries Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 60 135 Share Since February 5 th , 2025, a document warning about Curtis Yarvin and the Silicon Valley led coup attempt has been circulating among think tank experts and DNC employees. The document is titled “The Imminent Neoreactionary Threat to the American Republic”. It opens with a statement that the brief was, “iteratively and collectively compiled by a broad, bipartisan, and decentralized network of experts who wish to remain anonymous due to concerns about being targeted.” The full document is here . You can see the table of contents below: Thanks for reading Shatter Zone! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Subscribe The title of the actual file when I received it was “Evidence_Brief_for_Journalists”, and the introduction describes its aim as “explaining the nature of the current political crisis to journalists who are attempting to inform the public.” This would lead one to think the document was largely written for the benefit of the press. However I spoke with two sources who are members of these groups and received the document. They told me that to their knowledge the document mostly spreading among people you might broadly refer to as “policy wonks”. One source I interviewed explained: “It is a thing for think tanks to frame overviews for laypeople as briefs for journalists or congress, see the IPCC reports. Part of me thinks the framing ‘for journalists’ is just a shortcut for ‘this is somewhat specialized knowledge broken down’”. The paper opens by acknowledging the scope of the executive power grab being perpetrated under President Trump, and the destabilization wrought by Elon Musk and his DOGE team. It then notes, “the threat is an order of magnitude beyond” just a presidential power grab. Musk, it argues, is tied to a “broader group” of Silicon Valley tech elites, including Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, who seek to end Democracy. Curtis Yarvin is labeled a “thought leader” in this group, “called the Neoreactionaries”. I will stop here to note that this summary is accurate enough for mass consumption. But I have some issues with it. Musk probably would not label himself a Neoreactionary and does not have much of a history with Yarvin. Peter Thiel does, but it’s more a relationship of patronage than mutual influence. It would be more accurate to say that Thiel and Andreessen find Yarvin useful, because of his success in spreading to a lot of young techie kids the idea that CEOs should run the world. Musk, I feel, has largely jumped on this bandwagon because those kids are useful foot soldiers. Yarvin’s ideas about “retiring” all government employees and destroying the independent media and academia are convenient for his own ambitions. This context may be unnecessary for explaining the danger to regular people, but I think it is a mistake to credit Yarvin with more power than he holds. The document refers to him as the “leader” of the Neoreactionary Movement. I would not advise ignoring his influence and centrality here, but Yarvin is not dangerous because of his leadership abilities. That all said the document sums up the threat quite well: “The Neoreactionaries have openly stated their aims: to destroy the nation-state and the Constitutional order and replace them with a new privately owned corporate state, to be run by a CEO-dictator. Citizens become subjects owned by the state – ‘state slaves’ - because ‘everything rots when it has no owner—human beings included’.” Those quoted lines are, of course, Yarvin’s. From here, the document argues that Musk and his team are attempting to bring about this dystopia by taking over the “nervous system of the state”. These would be the data and communications systems DOGE is trying to centralize in its unaccountable hands. Next, the authors of this document make a call to action: “The most dramatic reversals of democratic breakdown (1977 India; 2022 Brazil; 2023 Poland) have been accomplished by radically large-tent, cross-ideological coalitions with little in common except a desire for the continuation of a Constitutional order. Evidence suggests that the present threat to American democracy is dire enough that such a broad-tent approach focused on Musk and his associates may be required.” This is the most interesting and hopeful part of the whole document for me. For one thing I think it accurately states what is needed in the present moment: a popular front against autocracy and dictatorship. (I would add to their list of relevant examples France from 1934-38 .) It is heartening to see evidence that this understanding has started to grow within the DNC policy set. The source who sent me this document in the first place described themselves as a member of “a few unofficial networks of climate activists who are high ranking in the government and policy / think tank circles”. They noted that these are normally “very milquetoast lib spaces” but “they’re being radicalized” rapidly. Both sources I interviewed for this requested anonymity. The second person I talked with gave an explicit reason: “…I’ve suspected for a while a lot more things in DNC stuff was compromised than people were comfortable with”. In other words, they believe the Republican Party has spies within the DNC. My sources worried these “GOP moles” might retaliate against them, but moreso they worried the document itself might contain false information, meant to provoke a reaction that would be useful to Republicans. While I think this caveat is worthwhile, I should also note that I have spent more time than most studying Curtis Yarvin and the Neoreactionaries. Nothing in this document struck me as obviously false or incorrect, nor did the tone seem hysteric or unreasonable. I asked my sources if over the past month they’d seen more people talking about Yarvin in their daily lives, which involve communicating and working with DNC staffers and politicians. One said, “No” and “That’s kind of one of the odd things to be frank. This guy is being brought to big events in D.C. He’s been referenced by Bannon and Vance. I have heard his talking points come from Republican mouths but he’s largely not tracked.” It is noteworthy, then, that influential individuals in the policy space, with connections to Democratic politicians and the DNC as an organization, have started a grassroots effort to spread the word about Yarvin as a threat. It is even more noteworthy that this document is unsparing about the danger, and the fact that a clock is currently ticking over all our heads: “If non-governmental actors (by which we mean unelected, unratified, unvetted, untrained, unconstrained, and/or unaccountable actors) gain access to key digital infrastructure, they can seize control of critical functions of government in ways that will be difficult or impossible to reverse.” In a section titled “National Security”, the focus shifts to Elon Musk, who it claims “poses a uniquely significant security risk”. This is because Musk and DOGE espouse “anti-Constitutional ideologies” and “are under the influence of America’s principal foreign adversaries (China and Russia)”. It goes on at some length about Musk’s foreign business interests and how they might compromise him. I don’t disagree that he is compromised, but I see his actions as very much consistent with those of a man seizing power for himself. I think it would be a strategic mistake to focus popular messaging around this in terms of how it empowers “America’s principal foreign adversaries”. The primary adversary Musk has empowered is himself, and he is now a greater danger to every citizen of the United States than any foreign government. The next section of the paper days out the definition of a coup: “In essence, a coup is a 1) rapid seizure of state power by unelected actors , who acquire that power by 2) seizing critical government infrastructure and 3) weaponizing it to neutralize legitimate government actors' efforts to stop them. The unelected actors then use this power to 4) remake the rules of the political game in a way that cannot easily be checked or undone through democratic processes.” It argues convincingly that all four of these steps are underway now. One thing I found compelling is the way it recognized the threat cryptocurrency represents right now, and how it can and will be used by the new regime to cement their power in ways that sidestep the present legal system: “Without canceling elections, for example, cryptocurrency can be used to create informal but powerful new levers of political influence: politicians can sell personal coins to unknown buyers who &quot;vote&quot; on public policy on the basis of their shareholder power, shielded from public view.” Next we have a summary of the Neoreactionary Agenda, which lists some additional names among the Silicon Valley elite currently championing an overthrow of democracy. These include David Sacks, Balaji Srinivasan and JD Vance. Also name-dropped is political theorist Nick Land, who is referenced twice in the paper. The authors next lay out Yarvin’s concept of the “Butterfly Revolution”, based on an essay he wrote in 2022 laying out how a “full reboot” of the U.S. government could be accomplished. Subsequent pages summarize the first days of the Trump administration and DOGE activity and show how they comport with the “Butterfly Revolution” blueprint. We’ve all lived that in real time, so I won’t summarize their arguments here. The document does end this segment with a section on “Actions and Rhetoric to Watch”. First are government contracts, which fund many of Musk’s companies at present. Next is “Greenland and Mars”: “A core tenet of neoreactionary ideology is the replacement of nation-states with &quot;network states.&quot; But states require territory. Technocracy Inc., a predecessor to the Neoreactionary movement whose one-time director was Elon Musk's grandfather, proposed a North American Technate where the entire continent of North America would be united under one Technocratic Super State. There is currently a Peter Thiel-backed &quot;network state&quot; project called Praxis in Greenland. Musk's public statements about colonizing Mars also can be read as part of a territorial project.” Lastly it lists Crypto, which the authors primarily seem to fear as a method of deniably bribing Trump. Overall, the document is thorough in its layout of the Neoreactionary ecosystem, and the actual plan currently being enacted to end U.S. democracy. It includes a section that lists several of the earliest known DOGE employees, and quotes extensively from Yarvin and less extensively from Land. The paper’s ultimate conclusion is that Musk is using this moment to turn himself into the kind of unitary all-powerful executive Yarvin longs for, one who rules alongside a largely “ceremonial” President. Congress and the courts would also be “ceremonial” at best in this new order. Again, I do not believe Musk is particularly well read on Curtis Yarvin’s work. But Yarvin’s dream of a CEO-King ruling next to a puppet president gels with what some of Elon’s confidants have described as his ambition. A recent Vanity Fair article quoted a “close associate” of Musk’s from Silicon Valley. He told them: “Elon believes he should be emperor of the world, and this is his way of showing people what he’s capable of as emperor. He truly believes his way of handling the world is the best possible outcome for everyone in it.” The last few weeks provide more than enough proof that the authors of this document accurately understand the danger we are in. Unfortunately, aside from the suggestion of a popular front against dictatorship, the document is short on solutions. There is one line that promises: “Section III articulates what Congress and other actors can do” to stop Musk. However, the document in its present form does not include a Section 3 or any comprehensive suggestions. If the situation weren’t so dire, I might find that funny.

Designating English as the Official Language of The United States,EXECUTIVE ORDER,01/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/,"Designating English as the Official Language of The United States &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Designating English as the Official Language of The United States The White House March 1, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose and Policy . From the founding of our Republic, English has been used as our national language. Our Nation&#8217;s historic governing documents, including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, have all been written in English. It is therefore long past time that English is declared as the official language of the United States. A nationally designated language is at the core of a unified and cohesive society, and the United States is strengthened by a citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language. In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream. Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society. This order recognizes and celebrates the long tradition of multilingual American citizens who have learned English and passed it to their children for generations to come. To promote unity, cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens, ensure consistency in government operations, and create a pathway to civic engagement, it is in America&#8217;s best interest for the Federal Government to designate one &#8212; and only one &#8212; official language. Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society. Accordingly, this order designates English as the official language of the United States. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For purposes of this order: (a) &#8220;Agency&#8221; has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, except that such term does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof. (b) &#8220;Agency Head&#8221; means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise specified in this order. Sec . 3 . Designating an Official Language for the United States . (a) English is the official language of the United States. (b) Executive Order 13166 of August 11, 2000 (Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency), is hereby revoked; nothing in this order, however, requires or directs any change in the services provided by any agency. Agency heads should make decisions as they deem necessary to fulfill their respective agencies&#8217; mission and efficiently provide Government services to the American people. Agency heads are not required to amend, remove, or otherwise stop production of documents, products, or other services prepared or offered in languages other than English. (c) The Attorney General shall rescind any policy guidance documents issued pursuant to Executive Order 13166 and provide updated guidance, consistent with applicable law. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production,EXECUTIVE ORDER,01/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/,"Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production The White House March 1, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . The production of timber, lumber, paper, bioenergy, and other wood products (timber production) is critical to our Nation&#8217;s well-being. Timber production is essential for crucial human activities like construction and energy production. Furthermore, as recent disasters demonstrate, forest management and wildfire risk reduction projects can save American lives and communities. The United States has an abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs, but heavy-handed Federal policies have prevented full utilization of these resources and made us reliant on foreign producers. Our inability to fully exploit our domestic timber supply has impeded the creation of jobs and prosperity, contributed to wildfire disasters, degraded fish and wildlife habitats, increased the cost of construction and energy, and threatened our economic security. These onerous Federal policies have forced our Nation to rely upon imported lumber, thus exporting jobs and prosperity and compromising our self-reliance. It is vital that we reverse these policies and increase domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security. Sec . 2 . Directives to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Chief of the United States Forest Service (USFS), respectively, shall each issue new or updated guidance regarding tools to facilitate increased timber production and sound forest management, reduce time to deliver timber, and decrease timber supply uncertainty, such as the Good Neighbor Authority described in 16 U.S.C. 2113a, stewardship contracting pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 6591c, and agreements or contracts with Indian tribes under the Tribal Forest Protection Act as contemplated by 25 U.S.C. 3115a. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall also each submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget any legislative proposals that would expand authorities to improve timber production and sound forest management. (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Secretary of Commerce, through the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, shall complete a strategy on USFS and BLM forest management projects under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1536) to improve the speed of approving forestry projects. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the FWS, shall also examine any applicable existing authorities that would permit executive departments and agencies (agencies) to delegate consultation requirements under section 7 of the ESA to other agencies and, if necessary, provide a legislative proposal to ensure consultation is streamlined. (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall together submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, a plan that sets a target for the annual amount of timber per year to be offered for sale over the next 4 years from Federal lands managed by the BLM and the USFS, measured in millions of board feet. (d) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, through the Directors of the FWS and the BLM, and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the USFS, shall complete the Whitebark Pine Rangewide Programmatic Consultation under section 7 of the ESA. (e) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall consider and, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law, adopt categorical exclusions administratively established by other agencies to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and reduce unnecessarily lengthy processes and associated costs related to administrative approvals for timber production, forest management, and wildfire risk reduction treatments. (f) Within 280 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall consider and, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law, establish a new categorical exclusion for timber thinning and re-establish a categorical exclusion for timber salvage activities. Sec . 3 . Streamlined Permitting . All relevant agencies shall eliminate, to the maximum extent permissible by law, all undue delays within their respective permitting processes related to timber production. Additionally, all relevant agencies shall take all necessary and appropriate steps consistent with applicable law to suspend, revise, or rescind all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and other agency actions that impose an undue burden on timber production. Sec . 4 . Endangered Species Committee . (a) Agencies are directed to use, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the ESA regulations on consultations in emergencies to facilitate the Nation&#8217;s timber production. The Secretary of the Interior, as Chairman of the Endangered Species Committee, shall ensure a prompt and efficient review of all submissions to such committee, to include identification of any legal deficiencies, in order to ensure the timely consideration of exemption applications and, where possible, to resolve such applications before the deadlines set by the ESA. (b) Federal members of the Endangered Species Committee, or their designees, shall coordinate to develop and submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, that identifies obstacles to domestic timber production infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA and recommends procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements. (c) The Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that the Director of the FWS, or the Director&#8217;s authorized representative, is available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other appropriate action concerning the applicability of the ESA&#8217;s emergency regulations. The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, or the Assistant Administrator&#8217;s authorized representative, is available for such consultation and to take such other action as may assist in applying the ESA&#8217;s emergency regulations. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

"Addressing The Threat To National Security from Imports of Timber, Lumber",EXECUTIVE ORDER,01/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-timber-lumber/,"Addressing the Threat to National Security from Imports of Timber, Lumber &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Addressing The Threat To National Security from Imports of Timber, Lumber The White House March 1, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (Trade Expansion Act), it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Policy . The wood products industry, composed of timber, lumber, and their derivative products (such as paper products, furniture, and cabinetry) is a critical manufacturing industry essential to the national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience of the United States. This industry plays a vital role in key downstream civilian industries, including construction. The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the wood supply chain from imported timber, lumber, and their derivative products being dumped onto the United States market. The United States has ample timber resources. The current United States softwood lumber industry has the practical production capacity to supply 95 percent of the United States&#8217; 2024 softwood consumption. Yet, since 2016 the United States has been a net importer of lumber. Wood products are a key input used by both the civilian construction industry and the military. Each year, the United States military spends over 10 billion dollars on construction. The military also invests in innovative building material technology, including processes to create innovative wood products such as cross-laminated timber. The procurement of these building materials depends on a strong domestic lumber industry and a manufacturing base capable of meeting both military-specific and wider civilian needs. It is the policy of the United States to ensure reliable, secure, and resilient domestic supply chains of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. Unfair subsidies and foreign government support for foreign timber, lumber, and their derivative products necessitate action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine whether imports of these products threaten to impair national security. Sec . 2 . Investigation . (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine the effects on the national security of imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. (b) In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled &#8220;Domestic production for national defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,&#8221; as well as other relevant factors, including: (i) the current and projected demand for timber and lumber in the United States; (ii) the extent to which domestic production of timber and lumber can meet domestic demand; (iii) the role of foreign supply chains, particularly of major exporters, in meeting United States timber and lumber demand; (iv) the impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices on United States timber, lumber, and derivative product industry competitiveness; (v) the feasibility of increasing domestic timber and lumber capacity to reduce imports; and (vi) the impact of current trade policies on domestic timber, lumber, and derivative product production, and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security. Sec . 3 . Required Actions . (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. (b) No later than 270 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that includes: (i) findings on whether imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products threaten national security; (ii) recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and (iii) policy recommendations for strengthening the United States timber and lumber supply chain through strategic investments and permitting reforms. Sec . 4 . Definitions . As used in this order: (a) The term &#8220;timber&#8221; refers to wood that has not been processed. (b) The term &#8220;lumber&#8221; refers to wood that has been processed, including wood that has been milled and cut into boards or planks. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq .), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order: Section 1 . Background . With Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), I determined that the failure of the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) to act to blunt the sustained influx of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, flowing from the PRC to the United States constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To address that threat, I invoked my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to impose ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of the PRC, as defined by the Federal Register notice described in section 2(d) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14200 of February 5, 2025 (Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China). Pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order 14195, I have determined that the PRC has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis through cooperative enforcement actions, and that the crisis described in Executive Order 14195 has not abated. Sec . 2 . Amendment . In recognition of the fact that the PRC has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis, section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195 is hereby amended by striking the words &#8220;10 percent&#8221; and inserting in lieu thereof the words &#8220;20 percent&#8221;.

Honoring Jocelyn Nungaray,EXECUTIVE ORDER,05/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/honoring-jocelyn-nungaray/,"Honoring Jocelyn Nungaray &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Honoring Jocelyn Nungaray The White House March 5, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Purpose and Policy . The prior administration&#8217;s immigration policies inexcusably endangered and caused enormous suffering within our Nation, including by causing the southern border to be overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics. These open-border policies are responsible for the horrific and inexcusable murders of many innocent American citizens at the hands of illegal aliens. One of those innocent victims was Jocelyn Nungaray, whose life was tragically cut short on June 17, 2024, when she was brutally murdered in Houston, Texas. Two Venezuelan illegal aliens who were allegedly Tren de Aragua gang members and were apprehended near the border in early 2024 &#8212; and then released into the United States by the prior administration &#8212; have been charged with her murder. Jocelyn was a precious 12 year old girl beloved by her family and friends for her kindness and infectious zeal for life. She loved animals and had a passion for ensuring that they had homes. It is fitting and in the national interest, therefore, that the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, a scenic area for coastal wildlife and recreation along the Gulf of America near Jocelyn&#8217;s home in Texas, will forever honor and preserve the memory of a beautiful American, Jocelyn Nungaray. Sec. 2 . Renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge to Honor Jocelyn Nungaray . Within 30 days of the date of this order, pursuant to authority under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) and other applicable law, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall update procedures as necessary and take all other appropriate actions to rename the area known as the &#8220;Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge&#8221; as the &#8220;Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge&#8221; and ensure that her life is permanently commemorated therein. The Secretary shall subsequently provide guidance to ensure all Federal references to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications, reflect its renaming. Sec. 3. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP,EXECUTIVE ORDER,06/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-perkins-coie-llp/,"Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP The White House March 6, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . The dishonest and dangerous activity of the law firm Perkins Coie LLP (&#8220;Perkins Coie&#8221;) has affected this country for decades. Notably, in 2016 while representing failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false &#8220;dossier&#8221; designed to steal an election. This egregious activity is part of a pattern. Perkins Coie has worked with activist donors including George Soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws, including those requiring voter identification. In one such case, a court was forced to sanction Perkins Coie attorneys for an unethical lack of candor before the court. In addition to undermining democratic elections, the integrity of our courts, and honest law enforcement, Perkins Coie racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff, and against applicants. Perkins Coie publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and promotion on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. It proudly excluded applicants on the basis of race for its fellowships, and it maintained these discriminatory practices until applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change. My Administration is committed to ending discrimination under &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant race-based and sex-based discrimination, including quotas, but purposefully hide the nature of such discrimination through deceiving language, have engaged in a serious violation of the public trust. Their disrespect for the bedrock principle of equality represents good cause to conclude that they neither have access to our Nation&#8217;s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec . 2 . Security Clearance Review . (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Perkins Coie. The heads of all agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec . 3 . Contracting . (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, racial discrimination, falsified documents designed to weaponize the Government against candidates for office, and anti-democratic election changes that invite fraud and distrust, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Perkins Coie and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with Perkins Coie or with entities that disclose doing business with Perkins Coie under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any service; (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Perkins Coie or with entities that do business with Perkins Coie effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec . 4 . Racial Discrimination . (a) The Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall review the practices of representative large, influential, or industry leading law firms for consistency with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including whether large law firms: reserve certain positions, such as summer associate spots, for individuals of preferred races; promote individuals on a discriminatory basis; permit client access on a discriminatory basis; or provide access to events, trainings, or travel on a discriminatory basis. (b) The Attorney General, in coordination with the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in consultation with State Attorneys General as appropriate, shall investigate the practices of large law firms as described in subsection (a) of this section who do business with Federal entities for compliance with race-based and sex-based non-discrimination laws and take any additional actions the Attorney General deems appropriate in light of the evidence uncovered. Sec . 5 . Personnel . (a) The heads of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Perkins Coie when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of all agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Perkins Coie employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Perkins Coie, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Section 1. &nbsp; Background . &nbsp;Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. &nbsp;The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. &nbsp;As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as &#8220;digital gold&#8221;. &nbsp;Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. &nbsp;The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC&#8217;s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. &nbsp;Just as it is in our country&#8217;s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 2. &nbsp; Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. &nbsp;It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States&#8217; other digital asset holdings. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sec. 3. &nbsp; Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the &#8220;Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,&#8221; capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Government BTC). &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Government BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. &nbsp;Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the &#8220;United States Digital Asset Stockpile,&#8221; capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce shall develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers. &nbsp;However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;&#8220;Government Digital Assets&#8221; means all Government BTC and all Stockpile Assets. &nbsp;The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the Secretary of the Treasury&#8217;s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) &nbsp; &nbsp;be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) &nbsp; be used for law enforcement operations; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(iii) &nbsp;be equitably shared with State and local law enforcement partners; or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(iv) &nbsp; be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(e) &nbsp;Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 4. &nbsp; Accounting. &nbsp;Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the President&#8217;s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Government Digital Assets in such agency&#8217;s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. &nbsp;If such agency holds no Government Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President&#8217;s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within 30 days of the date of this order. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sec. 5. &nbsp; General Provisions. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) &nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness,EXECUTIVE ORDER,07/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-public-service-loan-forgiveness/,"Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness The White House March 7, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . In 2007, the Congress established the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program to encourage Americans to enter the public service sector by promising to forgive their remaining student loans after they completed 10 years of service in those jobs while making 10 years of minimum payments. The prior administration abused the PSLF Program through a waiver process, using taxpayer funds to pay off loans for employees still years away from the statutorily required number of payments. Moreover, instead of alleviating worker shortages in necessary occupations, the PSLF Program has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means. The PSLF Program also creates perverse incentives that can increase the cost of tuition, can load students in low-need majors with unsustainable debt, and may push students into organizations that hide under the umbrella of a non-profit designation and degrade our national interest, thus requiring additional Federal funding to correct the negative societal effects caused by these organizations&#8217; federally subsidized wrongdoing. As President of the United States, I have a duty to protect, preserve, and defend the Constitution and our national security, which includes ending the subsidization of illegal activities, including illegal immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to public property, and disruption of the public order, which threaten the security and stability of the United States. Accordingly, it is the policy of my Administration that individuals employed by organizations whose activities have a substantial illegal purpose shall not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness. Sec . 2 . Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness . The Secretary of Education shall propose revisions to 34 C.F.R. 685.219, Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury as appropriate, that ensure the definition of &#8220;public service&#8221; excludes organizations that engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose, including: (a) aiding or abetting violations of 8 U.S.C. 1325 or other Federal immigration laws; (b) supporting terrorism, including by facilitating funding to, or the operations of, cartels designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189, or by engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy; (c) child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children or the trafficking of children to so-called transgender sanctuary States for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents, in violation of applicable law; (d) engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination; or (e) engaging in a pattern of violating State tort laws, including laws against trespassing, disorderly conduct, public nuisance, vandalism, and obstruction of highways. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

ⓘ ə- SAHNZH ; &#91; 3 &#93; né Hawkins ; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian editor, publisher, and activist who founded WikiLeaks in 2006. He came to international attention in 2010 after WikiLeaks published a series of leaks from Chelsea Manning , a United States Army intelligence analyst: &#91; 4 &#93; footage of a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad , U.S. military logs from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, and U.S. diplomatic cables . Assange has won multiple awards for publishing and journalism. Assange was raised in various places around Australia until his family settled in Melbourne in his middle teens. He became involved in the hacker community and was convicted for hacking in 1996. &#91; 5 &#93; &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 7 &#93; Following the establishment of WikiLeaks, Assange was its editor when it published the Bank Julius Baer documents , footage of the 2008 Tibetan unrest , and a report on political killings in Kenya with The Sunday Times . Publication of the leaks from Manning started in February 2010. In November 2010 Sweden wished to question Assange in an unrelated police investigation and sought to extradite him from the UK. &#91; 8 &#93; In June 2012, Assange breached his bail and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London . &#91; 9 &#93; He was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012 &#91; 10 &#93; on the grounds of political persecution and fears he might be extradited to the United States. &#91; 11 &#93; In 2013, he launched the WikiLeaks Party and unsuccessfully stood for the Australian Senate . &#91; 12 &#93; &#91; 13 &#93; Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation in 2019. &#91; 14 &#93; On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with Ecuadorian authorities. &#91; 15 &#93; The police were invited into the embassy and he was arrested. &#91; 16 &#93; He was found guilty of breaching the United Kingdom Bail Act and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison. &#91; 17 &#93; The U.S. government unsealed an indictment charging Assange with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion related to the leaks provided by Manning. &#91; 18 &#93; In May 2019 and June 2020, the U.S. government unsealed new indictments against Assange, charging him with violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and alleging he had conspired with hackers. &#91; 19 &#93; &#91; 20 &#93; &#91; 21 &#93; Critics have described these charges as an unprecedented challenge to press freedom with potential implications for investigative journalism worldwide. &#91; 22 &#93; &#91; 23 &#93; &#91; 24 &#93; Assange was incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh in London from April 2019 to June 2024, as the U.S. government's extradition effort was contested in the UK courts. &#91; 25 &#93; &#91; 26 &#93; &#91; 27 &#93; In 2024, following a High Court ruling that granted Assange a full appeal to extradition, Assange and his lawyers negotiated a deal with US prosecutors. Assange agreed to a plea deal in which he pleaded guilty to an Espionage Act charge of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified U.S. national defence documents in return for a sentence of time served . &#91; 28 &#93; &#91; 29 &#93; Following the hearing Assange flew to Australia, arriving on 26 June. &#91; 30 &#93; Early life [ edit ] Assange was born Julian Paul Hawkins on 3 July 1971 in Townsville , Queensland, &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 31 &#93; to Christine Ann Hawkins, &#91; 32 &#93; a visual artist , &#91; 33 &#93; &#58;&#8202;34&#8202; and John Shipton , an anti-war activist and builder. &#91; 34 &#93; The couple separated before their son was born. &#91; 34 &#93; When Julian was a year old his mother married Brett Assange, &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 37 &#93; an actor with whom she ran a small theatre company and whom Julian Assange regards as his father (choosing Assange as his surname). &#91; 31 &#93; &#91; 38 &#93; Christine and Brett Assange divorced around 1979. Christine then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, whom Julian Assange later described as ""a member of an Australian cult"" called The Family . Meynell and Christine Assange separated in 1982. &#91; 39 &#93; &#91; 33 &#93; &#91; 40 &#93; Julian Assange lived in more than thirty Australian towns and cities during his childhood. &#91; 41 &#93; &#91; 42 &#93; He attended several schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979–1983) &#91; 38 &#93; and Townsville State High School in Queensland &#91; 43 &#93; as well as being schooled at home. &#91; 36 &#93; In his mid-teens, he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne . He moved in with his girlfriend at age 17. &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 44 &#93; Assange studied programming , mathematics , and physics at Central Queensland University (1994) &#91; 45 &#93; and the University of Melbourne (2003–2006), &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 46 &#93; but did not complete a degree. &#91; 47 &#93; &#91; 48 &#93; Assange started the Puzzle Hunt tradition at the University of Melbourne, which was modelled after the MIT Mystery Hunt . &#91; 49 &#93; He was involved in the Melbourne rave scene, and assisted in installing an internet kiosk at Ollie Olsen 's club night called ""Psychic Harmony"", which was held at Dream nightclub in Carlton (now called Illusion). Assange's nickname at the raves was ""Prof"". &#91; 50 &#93; Hacking [ edit ] By 1987, aged 16, Assange had become a skilled hacker &#91; 51 &#93; &#91; 52 &#93; under the name Mendax , &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 53 &#93; &#91; 54 &#93; taken from Horace 's splendide mendax (from Latin, ""nobly untruthful""). &#91; 48 &#93; &#91; 55 &#93; &#91; 44 &#93; Around this time, the police raided his mother's home and confiscated his equipment. According to Assange, ""it involved some dodgy character who was alleging that we had stolen five hundred thousand dollars from Citibank"". Ultimately, no charges were raised and his equipment was returned, but Assange ""decided that it might be wise to be a bit more discreet"". &#91; 36 &#93; In 1988 Assange used social engineering to get the password to Australia's Overseas Telecommunications Commission's mainframes. &#91; 49 &#93; &#91; 44 &#93; Assange had a self-imposed set of ethics: he did not damage or crash systems or data he hacked, and he shared information. &#91; 44 &#93; &#91; 56 &#93; &#91; 49 &#93; The Sydney Morning Herald later opined that he had become one of Australia's ""most notorious hackers"", &#91; 57 &#93; and The Guardian said that by 1991 he was ""probably Australia's most accomplished hacker"". &#91; 54 &#93; Assange's official biography on WikiLeaks called him Australia's ""most famous ethical computer hacker"", &#91; 58 &#93; and the earliest version said he ""hacked thousands of systems, including the Pentagon "" when he was younger. &#91; 58 &#93; &#91; 59 &#93; &#91; 60 &#93; He and two others, known as ""Trax"" and ""Prime Suspect"", formed a hacking group called ""the International Subversives"". &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 61 &#93; &#91; 53 &#93; &#91; 54 &#93; According to NPR , David Leigh , and Luke Harding , Assange may have been involved in the WANK hack at NASA in 1989, but this has never been proven. &#91; 62 &#93; &#91; 5 &#93; &#91; 33 &#93; &#58;&#8202;42&#8202; Assange called it ""the origin of hacktivism "", and the Swedish television documentary WikiRebels , which was made with Assange's cooperation, also hinted he was involved. &#91; 35 &#93; In mid-1991 the three hackers began targeting MILNET , &#91; 59 &#93; a data network used by the US military, where Assange found reports he said showed the US military was hacking other parts of itself. &#91; 44 &#93; Assange found a backdoor and later said they ""had control over it for two years."" &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 59 &#93; In 2012, Ken Day, the former head of the Australian Federal Police computer crime team, said that there had been no evidence the International Subversives had hacked MILNET. In response to Assange's statements about accessing MILNET, Day said that ""Assange may still be liable to prosecution for that act—if it can be proved."" &#91; 63 &#93; Assange wrote a program called Sycophant that allowed the International Subversives to conduct ""massive attacks on the US military"". &#91; 35 &#93; The International Subversives regularly hacked into systems belonging to a ""who's who of the U.S. military-industrial complex "" &#91; 44 &#93; &#91; 64 &#93; &#91; 65 &#93; and the network of Australia National University . &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 59 &#93; &#91; 66 &#93; Assange later said he had been ""a famous teenage hacker in Australia, and I've been reading generals' emails since I was 17"". Assange has attributed his motivation to this experience with power. &#91; 67 &#93; &#91; 68 &#93; Arrest and trial [ edit ] The Australian Federal Police (AFP) set up an investigation called Operation Weather targeting The International Subversives. &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 44 &#93; &#91; 69 &#93; In September 1991, Assange was discovered hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel , a Canadian multinational telecommunications corporation. &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 48 &#93; &#91; 66 &#93; Another member of the International Subversives turned himself and the others in, &#91; 53 &#93; &#91; 44 &#93; and the AFP tapped Assange's phone line (he was using a modem ) and raided his home at the end of October. &#91; 70 &#93; The earliest detailed reports about Assange are 1990s Australian press reports on him and print and TV news of his trial. &#91; 71 &#93; &#91; 72 &#93; &#91; 73 &#93; He was charged in 1994 with 31 counts of crimes related to hacking, including defrauding Telecom Australia , fraudulent use of a telecommunications network, obtaining access to information, erasing data, and altering data. &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 72 &#93; &#91; 73 &#93; According to Assange, the only data he inserted or deleted was his program. &#91; 73 &#93; The prosecution argued that a magazine written by the International Subversives would encourage others to hack, calling it a ""hacker's manual"" and alleging that Assange and the other hackers posted information online about how to hack into computers they had accessed. &#91; 44 &#93; &#91; 72 &#93; His trial date was set in May 1995 &#91; 74 &#93; and his case was presented to the Supreme Court of Victoria , but the court did not take the case, sending it back to the County Court. &#91; 75 &#93; Assange fell into a deep depression while waiting for his trial and checked himself into a psychiatric hospital and then spent six months sleeping in the wilderness around Melbourne. &#91; 49 &#93; In December 1996, facing a theoretical sentence of 290 years in prison, &#91; 35 &#93; he struck a plea deal &#91; 7 &#93; and pleaded guilty to 24 hacking charges including breaches of the Crimes Act , and fraudulent use of a telecommunications network. &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 73 &#93; &#91; 58 &#93; The judge called the charges ""quite serious"" and initially thought a jail term would be necessary &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 69 &#93; but ultimately sentenced Assange to a fine of A$2,100 and released him on a A$5,000 good behaviour bond &#91; 5 &#93; &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 76 &#93; because of his disrupted childhood and the absence of malicious or mercenary intent. &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 77 &#93; &#91; 76 &#93; &#91; 69 &#93; After his sentencing, Assange told the judge that he had ""been misled by the prosecution in terms of the charges"" and ""a great misjustice has been done"". The judge told Assange ""you have pleaded guilty, the proceedings are over"" and advised him to be quiet. &#91; 69 &#93; &#91; 77 &#93; Assange has described the trial as a formative period and according to The New Republic , ""the experience set him on the intellectual path"" leading him to found WikiLeaks. &#91; 53 &#93; &#91; 65 &#93; Assange, about 2006 In 1993, Assange provided technical advice and support to help the Victoria Police Child Exploitation Unit to prosecute individuals responsible for publishing and distributing child pornography. &#91; 78 &#93; &#91; 73 &#93; His lawyers said he was pleased to assist, emphasising that he received no benefit for this and was not an informer. His role in helping the police was discussed during his 1996 sentencing on computer hacking charges. &#91; 79 &#93; &#91; 80 &#93; According to his mother, Assange also helped police ""remove a book on the Internet about how to build a bomb"". &#91; 73 &#93; Cypherpunks and programming [ edit ] See also: Cypherpunk In the same year, he took over running one of the first public Internet service providers in Australia, Suburbia Public Access Network, when its original owner, Mark Dorset, moved to Sydney . &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 81 &#93; He joined the cypherpunk mailing list in late 1993 or early 1994. &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 82 &#93; According to Robert Manne , Assange's main political focus at this time seems to have been the information-sharing possibilities created by the internet and its threats. &#91; 35 &#93; He began programming in 1994, authoring or co-authoring network &#91; 83 &#93; and encryption programs, such as the Rubberhose deniable encryption system. &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 84 &#93; &#91; 73 &#93; Assange wrote other programs to make the Internet more accessible &#91; 83 &#93; and developed cyber warfare systems like the Strobe port scanner which could look for weaknesses in hundreds of thousands of computers at any one time. &#91; 73 &#93; During this period of time he also moderated the AUCRYPTO forum, &#91; 85 &#93; ran a website that gave advice on computer security to 5,000 subscribers in 1996, &#91; 33 &#93; &#58;&#8202;45&#8202; and contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus 's Underground (1997), a book about Australian hackers including the International Subversives. &#91; 44 &#93; &#91; 86 &#93; According to Assange, he ""deliberately minimized"" his role in Underground so it could ""pull in the whole community"". &#91; 87 &#93; In 1998 he co-founded with Trax the "" network intrusion detection technologies"" company Earthmen Technology which developed Linux kernel hacking tools. &#91; 69 &#93; &#91; 49 &#93; During this period he also earned a sizeable income working as a consultant for large corporations. &#91; 73 &#93; In October 1998, Assange decided to visit friends and announced on the cypherpunks mailing list he would be ""hopscotching"" through Russia , Mongolia , China , Poland and Eastern Europe . &#91; 73 &#93; Leaks [ edit ] According to Assange, in the 1990s, he and Suburbia Public Access Network facilitated leaks for activists and lawyers. &#91; 88 &#93; Assange told Suelette Dreyfus that he had ""acted as a conduit for leaked documents"" when fighting local corruption. &#91; 35 &#93; While awaiting trial and trying to get custody of his son, Assange and his mother formed the activist organisation Parent Inquiry Into Child Protection. &#91; 73 &#93; An article in the Canadian magazine Maclean's later referred to it as ""a low-tech rehearsal for WikiLeaks"". &#91; 64 &#93; The group used the Australian Freedom of Information Act to obtain documents, and secretly recorded meetings with Health and Community Services. The group also used flyers to encourage insiders to anonymously come forward, and according to Assange they ""had moles who were inside dissidents."" An insider leaked a key internal departmental manual about the rules for custody disputes to the group. &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 36 &#93; In November 1996 Assange sent an email to lists he had created and mentioned a ""LEAKS"" project. &#91; 35 &#93; Assange stated that he registered the domain ""leaks.org"" in 1999, but did not use it. &#91; 69 &#93; &#91; 49 &#93; He publicised a patent granted to the National Security Agency in August 1999, for voice-data harvesting technology saying ""This patent should worry people. Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived in the bowels of an unaccountable foreign spy agency."" &#91; 85 &#93; WikiLeaks [ edit ] Main articles: WikiLeaks and List of material published by WikiLeaks Early publications [ edit ] Assange at the ""New Media Days 09"" in Copenhagen , November 2009 Assange and a group of other dissidents, mathematicians and activists established WikiLeaks in 2006. &#91; 73 &#93; &#58;&#8202;145–148&#8202; &#91; 35 &#93; Assange became a member of its advisory board. &#91; 89 &#93; From 2007 to 2010, Assange travelled continuously on WikiLeaks business, visiting Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 42 &#93; &#91; 90 &#93; &#91; 91 &#93; &#91; 92 &#93; In December 2006, the month WikiLeaks posted its first leak, Assange published a five-page essay that outlined the ""thought experiment"" behind the WikiLeaks strategy: use leaks to force organisations to reduce levels of abuse and dishonesty or pay ""secrecy tax"" to be secret but inefficient. Assange explained: &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 93 &#93; &#91; 94 &#93; The more secretive or unjust an organization is, the more leaks induce fear and paranoia in the leadership and planning coterie. This must result in minimization of efficient internal communications mechanisms (an increase in cognitive ""secrecy tax"") and consequent system-wide cognitive decline resulting in decreased ability to hold onto power as the environment demands adaptation. Assange found key supporters at the Chaos Computer Club conference in Berlin in December 2007, including Daniel Domscheit-Berg and Jacob Appelbaum and the Swedish hosting company PRQ . &#91; 95 &#93; &#58;&#8202; 134 &#8202; During this period, Assange was WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief and one of four permanent staff. &#91; 35 &#93; The organisation maintained a larger group of volunteers, and Assange relied upon networks of others with expertise. &#91; 96 &#93; &#58;&#8202;97&#8202; The organisation published internet censorship lists, leaks , &#91; 97 &#93; and classified media from anonymous sources . The publications include revelations about drone strikes in Yemen , corruption across the Arab world , &#91; 98 &#93; extrajudicial executions by Kenyan police, &#91; 99 &#93; 2008 Tibetan unrest in China, &#91; 100 &#93; and the ""Petrogate"" oil scandal in Peru . &#91; 101 &#93; From its inception, the website had a significant impact on political news in a large number of countries and across a wide range of issues. &#91; 96 &#93; From its inception, WikiLeaks sought to engage with the established professional media. It had good relations with parts of the German and British press. A collaboration with the Sunday Times journalist Jon Swain on a report on political killings in Kenya led to increased public recognition of the WikiLeaks publication, and this collaboration won Assange the 2009 Amnesty International New Media Award. &#91; 96 &#93; &#58;&#8202; 99 &#8202; Assange said that six men with guns tried to attack the compound that he slept at in Kenya after the report was published, but were scared away when a guard shouted. &#91; 60 &#93; The Kenya leak led to corruption being a major issue in the election that followed, which was marred by violence. According to Assange, ""1,300 people were eventually killed, and 350,000 were displaced. That was a result of our leak. On the other hand, the Kenyan people had a right to that information and 40,000 children a year die of malaria in Kenya. And many more die of money being pulled out of Kenya, and as a result of the Kenyan shilling being debased"". Reporters have discussed the moral dilemma involved in reporting the corruption in Kenya. &#91; 102 &#93; &#91; 103 &#93; &#91; 104 &#93; Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg at the 26C3 in Berlin, December 2009 WikiLeaks' international profile increased in 2008 when a Swiss bank, Bank Julius Baer , tried via a Californian court injunction to prevent the site's publication of bank records. &#91; 105 &#93; Assange commented that financial institutions ordinarily ""operate outside the rule of law"", and he received extensive legal support from free-speech and civil rights groups. &#91; 106 &#93; &#91; 107 &#93; Bank Julius Baer's attempt to prevent the publication via injunction backfired. As a result of the Streisand effect , the publicity drew global attention to WikiLeaks and the bank documents. &#91; 95 &#93; &#58;&#8202; 135 &#8202; By 2009 WikiLeaks had succeeded in Assange's intentions to expose the powerful, publish material beyond the control of states, and attract media support for its advocacy of freedom of speech , though not as much as he hoped; his goal of crowd-sourcing analysis of the documents was unsuccessful and few of the leaks attracted mainstream media attention. &#91; 95 &#93; &#58;&#8202;135&#8202; In July 2009 Assange released through Wikileaks the full report of a commission of inquiry, set up by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office , into corruption in the Turks and Caicos Islands . &#91; 108 &#93; &#58;&#8202;335&#8202; The report had been due for publication earlier in the year but an injunction obtained by some of those named had prevented its publication. &#91; 109 &#93; According to Assange, the Commission released a redacted report and then removed it. WikiLeaks obtained and restored the full text. &#91; 110 &#93; The report found that foreign property developers had given millions of US dollars in payments and secret loans to senior politicians in the islands, including the TCI's former premier, Michael Misick . &#91; 108 &#93; &#58;&#8202; 335 &#8202; &#91; 111 &#93; Manning leaks [ edit ] The Cablegate as well as Iraq and Afghan War releases impacted diplomacy and public opinion globally, with responses varying by region. &#91; 112 &#93; Collateral murder video [ edit ] Gun camera footage of the airstrike of 12 July 2007 in Baghdad, showing the deaths of journalists Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh by a US helicopter ("" Collateral Murder "") In April 2010, WikiLeaks released video footage of the 12 July 2007, Baghdad airstrike , that have been regarded by several debaters as evidence of war crimes committed by the U.S. military. &#91; 113 &#93; &#91; 114 &#93; &#91; 115 &#93; &#91; 116 &#93; &#91; 117 &#93; The news agency Reuters had earlier requested the footage through a US Freedom of Information Act request, but the request was denied. Assange and others worked for a week to break the U.S. military's encryption of the video, which they titled Collateral Murder and which Assange first presented at the U.S. National Press Club . &#91; 118 &#93; It shows United States soldiers fatally shooting 18 civilians from a helicopter in Iraq, &#91; 119 &#93; including Reuters journalists Namir Noor-Eldeen and his assistant Saeed Chmagh . &#91; 120 &#93; &#91; 113 &#93; &#91; 121 &#93; Iraq and Afghan War logs [ edit ] WikiLeaks published the Afghan War logs in July 2010. It was described by the New York Times as ""a six-year archive of classified military documents [that] offers an unvarnished and grim picture of the Afghan war"". &#91; 122 &#93; In October 2010, WikiLeaks published the Iraq War logs , a collection of 391,832 United States Army field reports from the Iraq War covering from 2004 to 2009. &#91; 123 &#93; Assange said that he hoped the publication would ""correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war, during the war, and which has continued after the war"". &#91; 124 &#93; Regarding his own role within WikiLeaks, he said, ""We always expect tremendous criticism. It is my role to be the lightning rod... to attract the attacks against the organization for our work, and that is a difficult role. On the other hand, I get undue credit."" &#91; 125 &#93; Assange travelled often and tried to stay away from Western intelligence agencies by checking into hotels under false names, sleeping on sofas and floors, and using encrypted phones and cash. &#91; 126 &#93; According to David Leigh and Luke Harding they had to persuade Assange to redact the names of Afghani informants, expressing their fear that they could be killed if exposed. In their book WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy they say Declan Walsh heard Assange say at a dinner when asked about redaction ""Well, they're informants, so if they get killed, they've got it coming to them. They deserve it."" &#91; 127 &#93; &#91; 128 &#93; Assange denies making this statement; &#91; 129 &#93; &#91; 130 &#93; speaking on PBS Frontline about the accusations he said ""It is absolutely right to name names. It is not necessarily right to name every name."" &#91; 131 &#93; John Goetz of Der Spiegel, who was also at the dinner, says that Assange did not make such a statement. &#91; 132 &#93; &#91; 133 &#93; &#91; 134 &#93; Release of US diplomatic cables [ edit ] In November 2010 WikiLeaks published a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic cables, &#91; 135 &#93; known as the ""Cablegate"" files. WikiLeaks initially worked with established Western media organisations, and later with smaller regional media organisations while also publishing the cables upon which their reporting was based. &#91; 136 &#93; &#91; 112 &#93; Assange told a media partner that he owned the information and had a financial interest in how it was released. &#91; 118 &#93; &#91; 137 &#93; The files show United States espionage against the United Nations and other world leaders, &#91; 138 &#93; &#91; 139 &#93; &#91; 140 &#93; revealed tensions between the U.S. and its allies, and exposed corruption in countries throughout the world as documented by U.S. diplomats, helping to spark the Arab Spring . &#91; 141 &#93; &#91; 142 &#93; In March 2010 a member of WikiLeaks using the handle ""Ox"", widely believed to be Julian Assange, talked to Chelsea Manning by text chat while she was submitting leaks to WikiLeaks. &#91; 143 &#93; &#91; 144 &#93; &#91; 145 &#93; &#91; 146 &#93; The US referred to these chat logs in the 2018 indictment of Julian Assange and filed an affidavit which said they were able to identify Assange as the person chatting with Manning using hints he made during the chats and that Manning identified him as Assange to Adrian Lamo . &#91; 147 &#93; &#91; 148 &#93; &#91; 149 &#93; &#91; 150 &#93; In the chat logs, Manning asks Assange if he was ""any good at LM hash cracking"", which would decrypt passwords. Assange said he was, and told Manning about rainbow tables that WikiLeaks used to crack hashes and find passwords associated with them. &#91; 150 &#93; &#91; 151 &#93; An affidavit by an FBI agent involved in bringing the case against Assange claimed this showed an ""illegal agreement"" to help crack a password. &#91; 150 &#93; &#91; 152 &#93; When Manning told Assange she had nothing else to submit to WikiLeaks, he replied that ""curious eyes never run dry in my experience."" &#91; 143 &#93; &#91; 153 &#93; &#91; 154 &#93; &#91; 155 &#93; During her court martial, Manning said she downloaded the detainee assessment briefs (DABs) for Guantanamo Bay after speaking to a member of Wikileaks via a secure online chat log. While discussing files on Guantanamo Bay, Manning asked Assange about detainee assessment briefs. She said that ""although he did not believe that they were of political significance, he did believe that they could be used to merge into the general historical account of what occurred at Guantanamo."" She added that ""after this discussion, I decided to download the data."" &#91; 145 &#93; Release of unredacted cables [ edit ] Main article: United States diplomatic cables leak §&#160;September 2011 release of mostly unredacted cables In 2011 a series of events compromised the security of a WikiLeaks file containing the leaked US diplomatic cables. &#91; 156 &#93; In August 2010, Assange gave Guardian journalist David Leigh an encryption key and a URL where he could locate the full file. In February 2011 David Leigh and Luke Harding of The Guardian published the encryption key in their book WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy . Leigh said he believed the key was a temporary one that would expire within days. WikiLeaks supporters disseminated the encrypted files to mirror sites in December 2010 after WikiLeaks experienced cyber-attacks. When WikiLeaks learned what had happened it notified the US State Department . On 25 August 2011, the German magazine Der Freitag published an article giving details which enabled people to piece the information together. On 1 September 2011, WikiLeaks announced they would make the unredacted cables public and searchable. &#91; 157 &#93; &#91; 158 &#93; The Guardian wrote that the decision to publish the cables was made by Assange alone, a decision that it and its four previous media partners condemned. &#91; 159 &#93; Glenn Greenwald wrote that ""WikiLeaks decided—quite reasonably—that the best and safest course was to release all the cables in full, so that not only the world's intelligence agencies but everyone had them, so that steps could be taken to protect the sources and so that the information in them was equally available"". &#91; 160 &#93; &#91; 161 &#93; The US established an Information Review Task Force (IRTF) to investigate the impact of WikiLeaks' publications. It involved as many as 125 people working over 10 months. &#91; 162 &#93; According to IRTF reports, the leaks could cause ""serious damage"" and put foreign US sources at risk. &#91; 163 &#93; The head of the IRTF, Brigadier General Robert Carr, testified under questioning at Chelsea Manning's sentencing hearing that the task force had found no examples of anyone who had lost their life due to WikiLeaks' publication of the documents. &#91; 164 &#93; &#91; 165 &#93; &#91; 166 &#93; &#91; 167 &#93; Ed Pilkington wrote in The Guardian that Carr's testimony significantly undermined the argument that WikiLeaks' publications put lives at risk. &#91; 164 &#93; At one of Assange's extradition hearings in 2020, a lawyer for the US said that ""sources, whose redacted names and other identifying information was contained in classified documents published by WikiLeaks, who subsequently disappeared, although the US can't prove at this point that their disappearance was the result of being outed by WikiLeaks."" &#91; 168 &#93; &#91; 169 &#93; &#91; 170 &#93; The US Justice Department conceded that it had not identified anyone harmed as a result of the disclosures in the agreement submitted to the court prior to his release. &#91; 171 &#93; The US cited the release in the opening of its request for extradition of Assange, saying his actions put lives at risk. &#91; 172 &#93; &#91; 171 &#93; John Young, the owner and operator of the website Cryptome , testified at Assange's extradition hearing that the unredacted cables were published by Cryptome on 1 September, the day before WikiLeaks, and they remain on the Cryptome site. &#91; 173 &#93; &#91; 174 &#93; Lawyers for Assange gave evidence it said would show that Assange was careful to protect lives. &#91; 175 &#93; &#91; 176 &#93; Later activities [ edit ] In December 2010 PostFinance said it was closing Assange's Swiss bank account because he ""provided false information regarding his place of residence during the account opening process"" but that there would be ""no criminal consequences"" for misleading authorities. WikiLeaks said the account was used to ""donate directly to the Julian Assange and other WikiLeaks Staff Defence Fund"" and said the closing was part of a banking blockade against WikiLeaks . &#91; 177 &#93; &#91; 178 &#93; According to the Associated Press , leaked documents from WikiLeaks include an unsigned letter from Julian Assange authorising Israel Shamir to seek a Russian visa on his behalf in 2010. WikiLeaks said Assange never applied for the visa or wrote the letter. &#91; 179 &#93; According to the New York Times , in November 2010 ""Assange had mused about seeking refuge in Russia"", and Russia issued Assange a visa in January 2011. &#91; 180 &#93; According to Andrew O'Hagan , during the 2011 Egyptian revolution when Mubarak tried to close the mobile phone networks, Assange and others at WikiLeaks ""hacked into Nortel and fought against Mubarak's official hackers to reverse the process"". &#91; 181 &#93; &#91; 182 &#93; &#91; 183 &#93; Over the next several years, WikiLeaks published the Guantanamo Bay files leak , &#91; 184 &#93; &#91; 185 &#93; the Syria Files , &#91; 186 &#93; the Kissinger cables , &#91; 187 &#93; and the Saudi cables. &#91; 188 &#93; As of July 2015, Assange said WikiLeaks had published more than ten million documents and associated analyses; he described it as ""a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents"". &#91; 189 &#93; Legal issues [ edit ] Swedish sexual assault allegations [ edit ] Main article: Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority Beginning in 2010, Assange contested legal proceedings in the United Kingdom concerning the requested extradition of Julian Assange to Sweden for a ""preliminary investigation"" &#91; 190 &#93; into accusations of sexual offences made in August 2010. Assange left Sweden for UK on 27 September 2010; an international arrest warrant was issued the same day. &#91; 191 &#93; &#91; 192 &#93; &#91; 193 &#93; He was suspected of rape of a lesser degree, unlawful coercion and three instances of sexual molestation. &#91; 191 &#93; In June 2012, Assange breached bail and sought refuge at Ecuador's Embassy in London and was granted asylum. &#91; 194 &#93; &#91; 195 &#93; Demonstration in support of Assange in front of Sydney Town Hall , 10 December 2010 On 12 August 2015, Swedish prosecutors announced that the statute of limitations had expired for three of the allegations against Assange while he was in the Ecuadorian embassy. The investigation into the rape allegation was also dropped by Swedish authorities on May 19th, 2017 because of Assange's asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy. &#91; 196 &#93; &#91; 197 &#93; Assange said in these proceedings that he feared he would ultimately be extradited to the United States if he were sent to Sweden. &#91; 198 &#93; In May 2019 the Swedish Prosecution Authority reopened the investigation against Assange. The prosecutors expressed the intent to extradite Assange from the United Kingdom after he served his 50-week prison sentence for skipping bail. &#91; 199 &#93; In June 2019, the Uppsala District Court denied a request to detain Assange, thereby preventing his extradition to Sweden. &#91; 200 &#93; On 19 November 2019, the prosecution dropped the case because ""the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed"" although they were confident in the complainant. &#91; 14 &#93; US criminal investigations [ edit ] See also: Indictment and arrest of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks §&#160;United States criminal investigations After WikiLeaks released the Manning material, United States authorities began investigating WikiLeaks and Assange to prosecute them under the Espionage Act of 1917 . &#91; 201 &#93; In November 2010, US Attorney-General Eric Holder said there was ""an active, ongoing criminal investigation"" into WikiLeaks. &#91; 202 &#93; It emerged from legal documents leaked over the ensuing months that WikiLeaks was being investigated by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia and the administration urged allies to open criminal investigations of Assange. &#91; 203 &#93; &#91; 204 &#93; Assange speaks on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral in London, 16 October 2011. Mural Collateral Crucifixion (FreeAssangeYesterday) at Stresemannstraße 15 in Berlin Kreuzberg , created by the artist duo Captain Borderline In 2010, the FBI told a lawyer for Assange that he wasn't the subject of an investigation. &#91; 205 &#93; That year the NSA added Assange to its Manhunting Timeline, an annual account of efforts to capture or kill alleged terrorists and others. &#91; 206 &#93; In 2011, the NSA discussed categorising WikiLeaks as a ""malicious foreign actor"" for surveillance purposes. &#91; 206 &#93; &#91; 207 &#93; In August 2011, WikiLeaks volunteer Sigurdur Thordarson contacted the FBI and became the first informant to work for the FBI from inside WikiLeaks. He gave the FBI several hard drives he had copied from Assange and core WikiLeaks members. &#91; 208 &#93; &#91; 209 &#93; In December 2011 prosecutors in the Chelsea Manning case revealed the existence of chat logs between Manning and someone they claimed was Assange. &#91; 210 &#93; &#91; 211 &#93; Assange said that WikiLeaks has no way of knowing the identity of its sources and that chats with sources, including user-names, were anonymous. &#91; 212 &#93; &#91; 213 &#93; In January 2011, Assange described the allegation that WikiLeaks had conspired with Manning, had communicated with Manning, as ""absolute nonsense"" because WikiLeaks only learned Manning's name from media reports. &#91; 214 &#93; The logs were presented as evidence during Manning's court-martial in June–July 2013. &#91; 215 &#93; The prosecution argued that they showed WikiLeaks helping Manning reverse-engineer a password. &#91; 216 &#93; During her trial, Manning said she acted on her own to send documents to WikiLeaks, and no one associated with WikiLeaks pressured her into giving more information. &#91; 217 &#93; In 2012 diplomatic cables between Australia and the United States were released that showed the US government was investigating Assange and that ""a broad range of possible charges are under consideration, including espionage and conspiracy"". The diplomats dismissed claims the investigation was politically motivated, and highlighted prosecutors' claims that Manning was ""guided by WikiLeaks' list of 'most wanted' leaks"". &#91; 218 &#93; In 2013 US officials said it was unlikely that the Justice Department would indict Assange for publishing classified documents because it would also have to prosecute the news organisations and writers who published classified material. &#91; 219 &#93; In June 2013, The New York Times said that court and other documents suggested that Assange was being examined by a grand jury and ""several government agencies"", including by the FBI . &#91; 220 &#93; Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that WikiLeaks was under ""active and ongoing"" investigation at that time. &#91; 221 &#93; Under the Obama Administration , the Department of Justice did not indict Assange because it could not find evidence that his actions differed from those of a journalist. &#91; 222 &#93; During the first Trump Administration , CIA director Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions stepped up pursuit of Assange. Law enforcement officials wanted to learn about Assange's knowledge of WikiLeaks's interactions with Russian intelligence and other actions. They had considered offering Assange some form of immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony and had reached out to Assange's lawyers. The negotiations were ended by the Vault 7 disclosures. &#91; 223 &#93; In April 2017 US officials were preparing to file formal charges against Assange. &#91; 224 &#93; Assange's indictment was unsealed in 2019 and expanded on later that year and in 2020. &#91; 225 &#93; &#91; 226 &#93; The legal scholar Steve Vladeck said that prosecutors likely accelerated the case in 2019 due to the impending statute of limitations on Assange's largest leaks. &#91; 227 &#93; In early 2019 the Mueller report wrote the Special Counsel's office considered charging WikiLeaks or Assange ""as conspirators in the computer-intrusion conspiracy"" and that there were ""factual uncertainties"" about the role that Assange may have played in the hacks or their distribution that were ""the subject of ongoing investigations"" by the US Attorney's Office. &#91; 228 &#93; &#91; 229 &#93; &#91; 230 &#93; Legal issues in Australia [ edit ] On 2 September 2011 Australia's attorney general , Robert McClelland released a statement that the US diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks identified at least one ASIO officer, and that it was a crime in Australia to publish information which could identify an intelligence officer. McClelland said that ""On occasions before this week, WikiLeaks redacted identifying features where the safety of individuals or national security could be put at risk. It appears this hasn't occurred with documents that have been distributed across the internet this week."" According to The Guardian and Al Jazeera, this meant ""Julian Assange could face prosecution in Australia."" &#91; 231 &#93; &#91; 232 &#93; In 2014 WikiLeaks published information about political bribery allegations, violating a gag order in Australia. &#91; 233 &#93; According to Peter Bartlett, a media lawyer in Australia, WikiLeaks was outside Australia's jurisdiction but ""if Assange ever comes back to Australia, you would expect that he would immediately be charged with breaking a suppression order."" &#91; 233 &#93; Ecuadorian embassy period [ edit ] See also: 2012-2013 Ecuador–United Kingdom diplomatic crisis Entering the embassy [ edit ] Assange on the balcony of Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 On 19 June 2012, the Ecuadorian foreign minister , Ricardo Patiño , announced that Assange had applied for political asylum , that the Ecuadorian government was considering his request, and that Assange was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London . &#91; 234 &#93; An office was converted into a studio apartment and equipped with a bed, telephone, sun lamp, computer, shower, treadmill, and kitchenette . &#91; 235 &#93; &#91; 236 &#93; &#91; 237 &#93; &#91; 238 &#93; The embassy staff removed the toilet in the women's bathroom at Assange's request so he could sleep in the quiet room. He was limited to roughly 30 square metres (320&#160;sq&#160;ft) and ate a combination of takeaways and food prepared by the embassy staff. &#91; 239 &#93; &#91; 240 &#93; In justifying his move, Assange said Sweden had a ""very, very poor judicial system"", weakened by external political meddling, careerism, and a culture of ""crazed radical feminist ideology"". More important, the case was a matter of international politics. ""Sweden is a U.S. satrapy "", he said. &#91; 241 &#93; Assange and his supporters said he was not concerned about any proceedings in Sweden as such but said that the Swedish allegations were designed to discredit him and were a pretext for his extradition from Sweden to the United States. &#91; 242 &#93; &#91; 243 &#93; &#91; 244 &#93; Assange breached his bail conditions by taking up residence in the embassy rather than appearing in court and faced arrest if he left. Assange's supporters, including journalist Jemima Goldsmith , forfeited £200,000 in bail and £40,000 as promised sureties. &#91; 245 &#93; &#91; 246 &#93; Goldsmith said she was surprised at his asylum bid and she wanted and expected him to face the Swedish allegations but that he had ""a real fear of being extradited to the US"". &#91; 246 &#93; &#91; 247 &#93; The UK government wrote to Patiño, saying that the police were entitled to enter the embassy and arrest Assange under UK law. &#91; 248 &#93; Patiño said it was an implied threat, stating that ""such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna Convention "". Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service were stationed outside the embassy from June 2012 to October 2015 to arrest Assange if he left the embassy and compel him to attend the extradition appeal hearing. The police officers were withdrawn on grounds of cost in October 2015, but the police said they would still deploy ""several overt and covert tactics to arrest him"". The Metropolitan Police Service said the cost of the policing for the period was £12.6 &#160; million. &#91; 249 &#93; The Australian attorney-general, Nicola Roxon , wrote to Assange's lawyer saying that Australia would not seek to involve itself in any international exchanges about Assange's future. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the Australian government had no evidence the US intended to charge and extradite Assange at that time, and Roxon suggested that if Assange was imprisoned in the US, he could apply for an international prisoner transfer to Australia. Assange's lawyers described the letter as a ""declaration of abandonment"". WikiLeaks insiders stated that Assange decided to seek asylum because he felt abandoned by the Australian government. &#91; 244 &#93; Ecuadoran foreign minister Ricardo Patiño met with Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy on 16 June 2013. On 16 August 2012 Patiño announced that Ecuador was granting Assange political asylum because of the threat represented by the United States secret investigation against him. &#91; 250 &#93; &#91; 251 &#93; &#91; 252 &#93; &#91; 253 &#93; In its formal statement, Ecuador said that ""as a consequence of Assange's determine",50000

It is funded by donations &#91; 13 &#93; and media partnerships. It has published classified documents and other media provided by anonymous sources. &#91; 14 &#93; It was founded in 2006 by Julian Assange . &#91; 15 &#93; Kristinn Hrafnsson is its editor-in-chief . &#91; 16 &#93; &#91; 17 &#93; Its website states that it has released more than ten million documents and associated analyses. &#91; 18 &#93; WikiLeaks' most recent publication of original documents was in 2019 and its most recent publication was in 2021. &#91; 19 &#93; From November 2022, numerous documents on the organisation's website became inaccessible. &#91; 19 &#93; &#91; 20 &#93; In 2023, Assange said that WikiLeaks is no longer able to publish due to his imprisonment and the effect that US government surveillance and WikiLeaks' funding restrictions were having on potential whistleblowers. &#91; 21 &#93; WikiLeaks has released document caches and media that exposed serious violations of human rights and civil liberties by various governments. It released footage of the 12 &#160; July 2007 Baghdad airstrike , titling it Collateral Murder , in which Iraqi Reuters journalists and several civilians were killed by a U.S. helicopter crew. &#91; 22 &#93; It published thousands of US military field logs from the war in Afghanistan and Iraq war , diplomatic cables from the United States and Saudi Arabia , &#91; 23 &#93; &#91; 24 &#93; and emails from the governments of Syria &#91; 25 &#93; &#91; 26 &#93; and Turkey . &#91; 27 &#93; &#91; 28 &#93; &#91; 29 &#93; WikiLeaks has also published documents exposing corruption in Kenya &#91; 30 &#93; &#91; 31 &#93; and at Samherji , &#91; 32 &#93; cyber warfare and surveillance tools created by the CIA , &#91; 33 &#93; &#91; 34 &#93; and surveillance of the French president by the National Security Agency . &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 36 &#93; During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign , WikiLeaks released emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager , showing that the party's national committee had effectively acted as an arm of the Clinton campaign during the primaries , seeking to undercut the campaign of Bernie Sanders . These releases resulted in the resignation of the chairwoman of the DNC and caused significant harm to the Clinton campaign . &#91; 37 &#93; During the campaign, WikiLeaks promoted false conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party and the murder of Seth Rich . &#91; 38 &#93; &#91; 39 &#93; &#91; 40 &#93; WikiLeaks has won numerous awards and been commended by media organisations, civil society organisations, and world leaders for exposing state and corporate secrets, increasing transparency, assisting freedom of the press , and enhancing democratic discourse while challenging powerful institutions. The organisation has been the target of campaigns to discredit it, including aborted ones by Palantir and HBGary . WikiLeaks has also had its donation systems interrupted by payment processors . As a result, the Wau Holland Foundation helps process WikiLeaks' donations. The organisation has been criticised for inadequately curating content and violating personal privacy. WikiLeaks has, for instance, revealed Social Security numbers , medical information , credit card numbers and details of suicide attempts . &#91; 41 &#93; &#91; 42 &#93; &#91; 43 &#93; News organisations, activists, journalists and former members have also criticised WikiLeaks over allegations of anti-Clinton and pro-Trump bias and a lack of internal transparency. Some journalists have alleged it had associations with the Russian government. Journalists have also criticised the organisation for promotion of conspiracy theories, and what they describe as exaggerated and misleading descriptions of the contents of leaks. The US CIA and United States Congress characterised the organisation as a "" non-state hostile intelligence service "" after the release of CIA tools for hacking consumer electronics in Vault 7 . &#91; 44 &#93; History Founding Julian Assange is a founding member of the WikiLeaks staff. The inspiration for WikiLeaks was Daniel Ellsberg 's release of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. Assange built WikiLeaks to shorten the time between a leak and its coverage by the media. WikiLeaks was established in Australia with the help of Daniel Mathews &#91; 45 &#93; and its servers were soon moved to Sweden and other countries that provided greater legal protection for the media. &#91; 46 &#93; Assange described WikiLeaks as an activist organisation and said that ""The method is transparency, the goal is justice"". &#91; 47 &#93; &#91; 48 &#93; The wikileaks.org domain name was registered on 4 October 2006. &#91; 46 &#93; The website was established and published its first document in December 2006. &#91; 49 &#93; &#91; 50 &#93; It described its founders as a mixture of Asian dissidents, journalists, mathematicians, and start-up company technologists from the United States , Taiwan , Europe , Australia , and South Africa . &#91; 51 &#93; &#91; 52 &#93; In January 2007 WikiLeaks organizer James Chen &#91; 53 &#93; &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 55 &#93; told TIME that ""We are serious people working on a serious project... three advisors have been detained by Asian government, one of us for over six years."" &#91; 52 &#93; WikiLeaks said that its ""primary interests are oppressive regimes in Asia, the former Soviet bloc, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East"" but it ""also expects to be of assistance to those in the West who wish to reveal unethical behaviour in their own governments and corporations"". &#91; 56 &#93; WikiLeaks was usually represented in public by Julian Assange, who has described himself as ""the heart and soul of this organisation"". &#91; 57 &#93; &#91; 58 &#93; Advisory board Assange formed an informal advisory board in the early days of WikiLeaks, with journalists, political activists and computer specialists as members. &#91; 59 &#93; In 2007 WikiLeaks said the board was still forming but that it included representatives from expatriate Russian and Tibetan refugee communities, reporters, a former US intelligence analyst and cryptographers."" &#91; 56 &#93; Members of the advisory board included Phillip Adams , Julian Assange, Wang Dan , Suelette Dreyfus , CJ Hinke, Tashi Namgyal Khamsitsang, Ben Laurie , Xiao Qiang , Chico Whitaker , Wang Youcai , and John Young . &#91; 59 &#93; &#91; 60 &#93; WikiLeaks' advisory board did not meet. According to Wired UK , most of the board members to whom they spoke said they had little involvement with WikiLeaks. &#91; 59 &#93; &#91; 61 &#93; Some said they did not know they were mentioned on the site, nor how they got there. &#91; 62 &#93; Computer security expert Ben Laurie said he had been a member of the board ""since before the beginning"", but he was not ""really sure what the advisory board means."" &#91; 59 &#93; Former board member Phillip Adams criticised the board, saying that Assange ""has never asked for advice. The advisory board was pretty clearly window dressing, so he went for people identified with progressive policies around the place."" &#91; 63 &#93; Assange responded by calling the advisory board ""pretty informal"". &#91; 63 &#93; When asked to join their initial advisory board, the promininent critic of secrecy Steven Aftergood declined; he said to Time that ""they have a very idealistic view of the nature of leaking and its impact. They seem to think that most leakers are crusading do-gooders who are single-handedly battling one evil empire or another."" &#91; 64 &#93; Early years In January 2007 John Young was dropped from the WikiLeaks network after questioning plans for a multimillion-dollar fundraising goal. &#91; 65 &#93; He accused the organisation of being a CIA conduit and published 150 pages of WikiLeaks emails. &#91; 59 &#93; &#91; 66 &#93; &#91; 67 &#93; According to Wired , the emails document the group's attempts to create a profile for themselves and arguments over how to do so. They also discuss political impact and positive reform and include calls for transparency around the world. &#91; 59 &#93; &#91; 68 &#93; In January 2010 WikiLeaks shut down its website while management appealed for donations. &#91; 69 &#93; Previously published material was no longer available, although some could still be accessed on unofficial mirror websites . &#91; 70 &#93; WikiLeaks stated that it would resume full operation once the operational costs were paid. &#91; 69 &#93; WikiLeaks said the work stoppage was ""to ensure that everyone who is involved stops normal work and actually spends time raising revenue"". &#91; 71 &#93; The organisation planned for funds to be secured by 6 January 2010, and on 3 February that WikiLeaks announced that its fundraising goal had been achieved. &#91; 72 &#93; In February 2010 WikiLeaks helped propose the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative legislation to establish a ""journalism safe haven"" in Iceland . &#91; 73 &#93; In June, the parliament voted unanimously for the resolution. &#91; 74 &#93; WikiLeaks originally used a wiki format website, and was changed when it relaunched in May 2010. The blogger Ryan Singel claimed that after the website relaunched, its cryptographic security had degraded. &#91; 75 &#93; &#91; 76 &#93; In October 2010 the server WikiLeaks used to host its encrypted communications was compromised by hackers that a WikiLeaks spokesperson described as ""very skilled"". The spokesperson said that ""the server got attacked, hacked, and the private keys got out""; they said it was the first breach in WikiLeaks' history. &#91; 77 &#93; In November 2010, WikiLeaks said that its website was compromised hours before releasing US diplomatic cables . &#91; 78 &#93; &#91; 79 &#93; &#91; 80 &#93; In December 2010 Spamhaus reported issued a malware warning for ""WikiLeaks.info"", a ""very loosely"" affiliated website that ""WikiLeaks.org"" redirected to. The website said they could ""guarantee that there is no malware on it"". &#91; 81 &#93; &#91; 82 &#93; &#91; 83 &#93; 2010 internal dissent A series of resignations of key members of WikiLeaks began in September 2010, started by Assange's decision to release the Iraq War logs the next month, internal conflicts with other members and his response to sexual assault allegations. &#91; 84 &#93; &#91; 85 &#93; &#91; 86 &#93; &#91; 87 &#93; According to Herbert Snorrason, ""We found out that the level of redactions performed on the Afghanistan documents was not sufficient. I announced that if the next batch did not receive full attention, I would not be willing to cooperate."" &#91; 87 &#93; Some members of WikiLeaks called for Assange to step aside. &#91; 88 &#93; On 25 September 2010 after being suspended by Assange for ""disloyalty, insubordination and destabilisation"", Daniel Domscheit-Berg , the German spokesman for WikiLeaks, told Der Spiegel that he was resigning. He said ""WikiLeaks has a structural problem. I no longer want to take responsibility for it, and that's why I am leaving the project."" &#91; 89 &#93; &#91; 87 &#93; Assange accused Domscheit-Berg of leaking information to Newsweek , with Domscheit-Berg saying that the WikiLeaks team was unhappy with Assange's management and handling of the Afghan war document releases. &#91; 87 &#93; &#91; 90 &#93; Domscheit-Berg said he wanted greater transparency in WikiLeaks finances and the leaks released to the public. &#91; 91 &#93; &#91; 92 &#93; &#91; 93 &#93; According to various sources, Domscheit-Berg had copied and then deleted over 3,500 unpublished whistleblower communications. Some communications &#91; 94 &#93; contained hundreds of documents, &#91; 95 &#93; &#91; 96 &#93; &#91; 97 &#93; including the US government's No Fly List , &#91; 98 &#93; Bank of America leaks, &#91; 99 &#93; insider information from 20 neo-Nazi organisations, &#91; 98 &#93; &#91; 100 &#93; documents sent by Renata Avila about torture and government abuse of a Latin American country &#91; 101 &#93; and US intercept information for ""over a hundred Internet companies"". &#91; 102 &#93; Assange stated that Domscheit-Berg had deleted video files of the Granai massacre by a US Bomber. WikiLeaks had scheduled the video for publication before its deletion. &#91; 103 &#93; According to Andy Müller-Maguhn , it was an eighteen-gigabyte collection. &#91; 104 &#93; Domscheit-Berg said he took the files from WikiLeaks because he did not trust its security. In Domscheit-Berg's book he wrote he was ""waiting for Julian to restore security, so that we can return the material to him"". &#91; 105 &#93; &#91; 106 &#93; &#91; 107 &#93; The Architect and Domscheit-Berg encrypted the files and gave them to a third party who did not have the key. &#91; 104 &#93; In August 2011 Domscheit-Berg said he permanently deleted the files ""to ensure that the sources are not compromised."" &#91; 108 &#93; He said that WikiLeaks' claims about the Bank of America files were ""false and misleading"" &#91; 109 &#93; and they were lost because of an IT problem. &#91; 95 &#93; The Architect left with Domscheit-Berg, taking the code &#91; 110 &#93; behind the submission system with him. &#91; 111 &#93; &#91; 105 &#93; &#91; 106 &#93; WikiLeaks submissions stayed offline until 2015. &#91; 112 &#93; &#91; 113 &#93; Herbert Snorrason resigned after he challenged Assange on his decision to suspend Domscheit-Berg and was bluntly rebuked. &#91; 87 &#93; Iceland MP Birgitta Jónsdóttir also left WikiLeaks, citing lack of transparency, lack of structure, and poor communication flow. &#91; 114 &#93; James Ball left WikiLeaks over disputes about Assange's handling of finances, and Assange's relationship to Israel Shamir , an individual who has promoted antisemitism and holocaust denial. &#91; 115 &#93; &#91; 116 &#93; According to the British newspaper, The Independent , at least a dozen key supporters of WikiLeaks left the website during 2010. &#91; 117 &#93; Several staffers who broke with Assange joined with Domscheit-Berg to start OpenLeaks , &#91; 118 &#93; a new leak organisation and website with a different management and distribution philosophy. &#91; 89 &#93; &#91; 119 &#93; Sarah Harrison , who stayed with WikiLeaks, later told Andrew O'Hagan she did not agree with the way he did it, but Domscheit-Berg had a basic point. She added that ""you can tell he was probably just trying to say something true and got hated for it. That's the way it is with Julian: he can't listen. He doesn't get it."" &#91; 120 &#93; Actions against WikiLeaks See also: Surveillance of Julian Assange In early 2010 Assange said that he obtained documents showing that two State Department agents tailed him on a flight from Iceland to Norway. Icelandic journalists were unable to verify Assange's allegations, which were denied by the State Department. Assange did not release the alleged documents. &#91; 121 &#93; &#91; 122 &#93; &#91; 123 &#93; &#91; 124 &#93; Assange also said that a volunteer was arrested in March and questioned about WikiLeaks. According to Assange, police said that authorities had spied on and photographed a private WikiLeaks meeting. WikiLeaks later admitted that the interrogation did not happen as originally suggested. According to the deputy head of news for RUV , the arrest was unrelated to WikiLeaks but the volunteer mentioned WikiLeaks to the police and said the laptop he had with him was owned by WikiLeaks. &#91; 121 &#93; Daniel Domscheit-Berg wrote that The rumors that he was being followed originated in part from his overactive imagination. But they also had the advantage of giving him the aura of someone in dire peril, increasing the collective anticipation of every new leak. Julian didn't need a marketing department. Marketing was something he himself knew best. &#91; 123 &#93; &#91; 124 &#93; After Julian Assange was granted asylum and entered the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012, new CCTV cameras were installed and security personnel working for UC Global and Promsecurity recorded his activities and interactions, including with his legal team. &#91; 125 &#93; In a 2017 email, the surveillance was justified with suspicions that Assange was ""working for the Russian intelligence services ."" &#91; 126 &#93; New cameras and microphones were installed in December 2017, and Morales arranged for the United States to have immediate access to the recordings. &#91; 127 &#93; Campaigns to discredit WikiLeaks See also: Response from corporations Writing for The Guardian in 2010, Nick Davies said there was ""some evidence of low-level attempts to smear Wikileaks"", including false online accusations involving Assange and money. &#91; 128 &#93; In 2010, Wikileaks published a 2008 US military report that said leaks to WikiLeaks ""could result in increased threats to DoD personnel, equipment, facilities, or installations"". The report suggested a plan to identify and expose WikiLeaks' sources to ""deter others from using WikiLeaks"" and ""destroy the center of gravity"" of Wikileaks by attacking its trustworthiness. &#91; 128 &#93; &#91; 129 &#93; &#91; 130 &#93; According to Clint Hendler writing in the Columbia Journalism Review , many reactions to the document were ""overwrought"" and ""the spin"" by WikiLeaks was ""a step too far"". &#91; 121 &#93; In 2010 the Bank of America employed the services of a collection of information security firms, known as Team Themis, when the bank became concerned about information that WikiLeaks was planning to release about it. Team Themis included private intelligence and security firms HBGary Federal, Palantir Technologies and Berico Technologies. &#91; 131 &#93; &#91; 132 &#93; &#91; 133 &#93; In 2011 hacktivist group Anonymous released emails from HBGary Federal showing that Team Themis proposed a plan which suggested ""[spreading] disinformation"" and ""disrupting"" Glenn Greenwald 's support for WikiLeaks. &#91; 134 &#93; Team Themis planned to expose the workings of WikiLeaks using disinformation and cyberattacks. The plans were not implemented and, after the emails were published, Palantir CEO Alex Karp issued a public apology to ""progressive organizations ... and Greenwald"" for his company's role. &#91; 135 &#93; &#91; 132 &#93; &#91; 136 &#93; Other See also: Reception of WikiLeaks §&#160;Response from the financial industry , WikiLeaks §&#160;Financial blockade , and WikiLeaks §&#160;Hosting In December 2010 PayPal suspended the WikiLeaks account after they received a letter from the US State Department that characterised WikiLeaks' activities as illegal in the US. &#91; 137 &#93; Mastercard and Visa Europe also stopped accepting payments to WikiLeaks after pressure from the US. &#91; 138 &#93; Bank of America , Amazon and Swiss bank PostFinance had previously stopped dealing with WikiLeaks. Datacell, the IT company that enabled WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations, said Visa's action was the result of political pressure. &#91; 137 &#93; &#91; 139 &#93; WikiLeaks referred to these actions as a banking blockade. &#91; 140 &#93; In response to the companies' actions, the hacker group Anonymous launched a series of cyberattacks against the companies, and against the Swedish Prosecution Authority for its attempted extradition of Assange . &#91; 141 &#93; &#91; 142 &#93; WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said: [Anonymous] is not affiliated with Wikileaks. There has been no contact between any Wikileaks staffer and anyone at Anonymous. Wikileaks has not received any prior notice of any of Anonymous' actions. We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks. We believe they are a reflection of public opinion on the actions of the targets. &#91; 143 &#93; Cyber-attacks and legal restrictions forced WikiLeaks to change server hosts several times by 2010. &#91; 144 &#93; &#91; 145 &#93; &#91; 146 &#93; 2011–2015 In December 2011 WikiLeaks launched Friends of WikiLeaks , a social network for supporters and founders of the website. Friends of WikiLeaks was designed for users to never have more than 12 friends, half local and half international. The site was in beta status. &#91; 147 &#93; In July 2012 WikiLeaks took credit for a fake New York Times website and article falsely attributed to Bill Keller . &#91; 148 &#93; &#91; 149 &#93; &#91; 150 &#93; &#91; 151 &#93; The hoax prompted criticism from commenters and the public, who said it hurt WikiLeaks' credibility. Glenn Greenwald wrote in Salon that it might have been satire but it doesn't strike me as a good idea for a group that relies on its credibility when it comes to the authenticity of what they publish&#160;&#8211;&#32; and which thus far has had a stellar record in that regard&#160;&#8211;&#32; to be making boastful claims that they published forged documents. I understand and appreciate the satire, but in this case, it directly conflicts with, and undermines, the primary value of WikiLeaks. &#91; 149 &#93; &#91; 152 &#93; &#91; 153 &#93; WikiLeaks said it wanted to bring attention to the banking blockade. &#91; 148 &#93; In January 2013, shortly after Aaron Swartz died, WikiLeaks said that Swartz had helped WikiLeaks and had talked to Julian Assange in 2010 and 2011. WikiLeaks also said it had ""strong reasons to believe, but cannot prove"", he may have been a source, breaking WikiLeaks' rules about source anonymity. Journalists suggested that Wikileaks may have made the statements to imply that Swartz was targeted by the US Attorney's Office and Secret Service in order to get at WikiLeaks. &#91; 154 &#93; &#91; 155 &#93; In 2013 the organisation assisted Edward Snowden leave Hong Kong. Sarah Harrison , a WikiLeaks activist, accompanied Snowden on the flight. According to US investigators, WikiLeaks played an active role in assisting Snowden to disclose a cache of NSA documents . &#91; 156 &#93; Scott Shane of The New York Times stated that the involvement ""shows that despite its shoestring staff, limited fund-raising from a boycott by major financial firms, and defections prompted by Mr. Assange's personal troubles and abrasive style, it remains a force to be reckoned with on the global stage."" &#91; 157 &#93; In September 2013 Julian Assange announced the creation of the WikiLeaks counterintelligence unit. The project surveilled 19 surveillance contractors to understand their business dealings. According to Assange, they were ""tracking the trackers"" to ""counter threats against investigative journalism and the public's right to know."" &#91; 158 &#93; &#91; 159 &#93; The WikiLeaks Party was created in 2013 in part to support Julian Assange 's failed bid for a Senate seat in Australia in the 2013 election , where it won 0.62% of the national vote. &#91; 160 &#93; &#91; 161 &#93; Assange said the party would advance WikiLeaks' objectives of promoting openness in government and politics and that it would combat intrusions on individual privacy. &#91; 160 &#93; &#91; 162 &#93; &#91; 163 &#93; &#91; 164 &#93; In December 2013, a delegation from the party, including its chairman John Shipton , visited Syria and met with President Bashar al-Assad . Shipton said the goal of the meeting was demonstrating ""solidarity with the Syrian people and their nation"", improving the party's understanding of the country's civil war and told a Syrian TV station that WikiLeaks would be opening an office in Damascus in 2014. The meeting with Assad was criticised by the Australian Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and many WikiLeaks supporters. &#91; 165 &#93; &#91; 166 &#93; &#91; 167 &#93; Shipton stated that the meeting with al-Assad was ""just a matter of good manners"" and that the delegation had also met with members of the Syrian opposition. &#91; 166 &#93; However, these meetings with the opposition have not been verified. The WikiLeaks Party was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission on 23 July 2015 for lack of members under the Electoral Act . &#91; 168 &#93; &#91; 169 &#93; &#91; 170 &#93; In 2015 WikiLeaks began issuing "" bounties "" of up to $100,000 for leaks. &#91; 171 &#93; Assange had said in 2010 that WikiLeaks didn't but ""would have no problem giving sources cash"" and that there were systems in Belgium to let them. &#91; 71 &#93; WikiLeaks has issued crowd-sourced rewards for the TTIP chapters, the TPP &#91; 171 &#93; and information on the Kunduz massacre . &#91; 172 &#93; &#91; 173 &#93; &#91; self-published source &#93; WikiLeaks has issued other bounties for LabourLeaks, &#91; 174 &#93; &#91; self-published source &#93; 2016 U.S. Presidential election -related information, &#91; 175 &#93; &#91; 176 &#93; and information to get a reporter at The Intercept fired over the Reality Winner case . &#91; 177 &#93; &#91; self-published source &#93; WikiLeaks has defended the practice with their vetting record, saying ""police rewards produce results. So do journalistic rewards."" &#91; 173 &#93; &#91; 176 &#93; Its website stated in 2015 that it had released 10 million documents online. &#91; 18 &#93; 2016 U.S. presidential election See also: 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak , Podesta emails , and Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections Assange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: ""I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgement and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ... she certainly should not become president of the United States."" &#91; 178 &#93; In a 2017 interview by Amy Goodman , Julian Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea . ""Personally, I would prefer neither."" &#91; 179 &#93; WikiLeaks editor Sarah Harrison stated that the site was not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information available to them. &#91; 180 &#93; In conversations that were leaked in February 2018, Assange expressed a preference for a Republican victory in the 2016 election, saying that ""Dems+Media+liberals would then form a block to reign in their worst qualities. With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities, dems+media+neoliberals will be mute. She's a bright, well connected, sadistic sociopath"". &#91; 181 &#93; Having released information about a broad range of organisations and politicians, WikiLeaks started by 2016 to focus almost exclusively on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. &#91; 182 &#93; In the 2016 U.S. presidential election , WikiLeaks only exposed material damaging to the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton. According to The New York Times , WikiLeaks timed one of its large leaks so that it would happen on the eve of the Democratic Convention . &#91; 183 &#93; The Sunlight Foundation said that such actions meant that WikiLeaks was no longer striving to be transparent but rather sought to achieve political goals. &#91; 184 &#93; Thomas Joscelyn , a senior fellow at Just Security , wrote that Assange had a ""hatred of Clinton"", whom he said was a ""sadistic sociopath"". Joscelyn wrote that ""WikiLeaks' collusion with Russian government hackers during the 2016 presidential campaign"" was ""arguably even more consequential"" than the Iraq War documents leak , the Afghan War documents leak and the United States diplomatic cables leak . According to Joscelyn, ""Assange made it his goal in 2016 to counter the 'American liberal press,' which he accused of supporting Clinton. He aimed to turn that same press against her. Ultimately, with Russia's help, Assange succeeded."" &#91; 185 &#93; Secret correspondence between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. In November 2017 it was revealed that the WikiLeaks Twitter account secretly corresponded with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. &#91; 186 &#93; &#91; 187 &#93; The correspondence shows how WikiLeaks actively solicited the co-operation of Trump Jr., a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it looked as if the Trump campaign would lose. &#91; 186 &#93; WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share a WikiLeaks tweet with the made-up &#91; 188 &#93; quote ""Can't we just drone this guy?"" which True Pundit said Hillary Clinton made about Assange. &#91; 186 &#93; &#91; 189 &#93; WikiLeaks also shared a link to a site that would help people to search through WikiLeaks documents. &#91; 186 &#93; Trump Jr. shared both. After the election, WikiLeaks also requested that the president-elect push Australia to appoint Assange as ambassador to the US . Trump Jr. provided this correspondence to congressional investigators looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election. &#91; 186 &#93; Assange repeated his offer of being ambassador to the US after the messages became public, publicly tweeting to Donald Trump Jr. that ""I could open a hotel style embassy in DC with luxury immunity suites for whistleblowers. The public will get a turbo-charged flow of intel about the latest CIA plots to undermine democracy. DM me"". &#91; 190 &#93; &#91; 191 &#93; The secretive exchanges led to criticism of WikiLeaks by some former supporters. WikiLeaks tweeted that the Clinton campaign was ""constantly slandering"" it as ""a 'pro-Trump' 'pro-Russia' source"". Journalist Barrett Brown , a long-time defender of WikiLeaks, was exasperated that Assange was ""complaining about 'slander' of being pro-Trump IN THE ACTUAL COURSE OF COLLABORATING WITH TRUMP"". He wrote: ""Was ""Wikileaks staff"" lying on Nov 10, 2016, when they claimed, ""The allegations that we have colluded with Trump, or any other candidate for that matter, or with Russia, are just groundless and false"", or did Assange lie to them?"" &#91; 192 &#93; Brown said Assange had acted ""as a covert political operative"", thus betraying WikiLeaks' focus on exposing ""corporate and government wrongdoing"". &#91; 192 &#93; Promotion of false conspiracy theories In 2016 and 2017, WikiLeaks promoted several false conspiracy theories , &#91; 38 &#93; &#91; 39 &#93; &#91; 40 &#93; most related to the 2016 United States presidential election . Murder of Seth Rich Further information: Murder of Seth Rich WikiLeaks promoted conspiracy theories about the murder of Seth Rich. &#91; 193 &#93; &#91; 194 &#93; &#91; 195 &#93; Unfounded conspiracy theories, spread by some right-wing figures and media outlets, hold that Rich was the source of leaked emails and was killed for working with WikiLeaks. &#91; 196 &#93; WikiLeaks fuelled such theories when it offered a $20,000 reward for information on Rich's killer and when Assange implied that Rich was the source of the DNC leaks, &#91; 197 &#93; although no evidence supports that. &#91; 198 &#93; &#91; 199 &#93; Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election said that Assange ""implied falsely"" that Rich was the source in order to obscure that Russia was the actual source. &#91; 200 &#93; &#91; 201 &#93; &#91; 202 &#93; Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton WikiLeaks popularised conspiracy theories about the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting articles which suggested Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals , &#91; 38 &#93; &#91; 203 &#93; &#91; 204 &#93; claiming that Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike Assange, &#91; 188 &#93; &#91; 205 &#93; suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews, &#91; 206 &#93; promoting thinly sourced theories about Clinton's health and according to Bloomberg creating ""anti-Clinton theories out of whole cloth"". &#91; 40 &#93; &#91; 207 &#93; Promotion of false flag theories On the day the Vault 7 documents were first released, WikiLeaks described UMBRAGE as ""a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation,"" and tweeted, ""CIA steals other groups virus and malware facilitating false flag attacks."" &#91; 208 &#93; A conspiracy theory soon emerged alleging that the CIA framed the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections . Conservative commentators such as Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter speculated about this possibility on Twitter, and Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio show. &#91; 209 &#93; Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that Vault 7 showed that ""the CIA could get access to such 'fingerprints' and then use them."" &#91; 208 &#93; In The Washington Post the cybersecurity researcher Ben Buchanan writes that he is sceptical of those theories and that he believes Russia to have initially obtained the DNC emails. &#91; 210 &#93; In April 2017 the WikiLeaks Twitter account suggested that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack , which international human rights organisations attributed to the Syrian government, was a false flag attack. &#91; 211 &#93; WikiLeaks stated that ""while western establishment media beat the drum for more war in Syria the matter is far from clear"", and shared a video by a Syrian activist who said that Islamist extremists were probably behind the attack, not the Syrian government . &#91; 211 &#93; Later years In 2016 the WikiLeaks Twitter account was criticised for tweets that were seen as antisemitic . &#91; 212 &#93; &#91; 213 &#93; &#91; 214 &#93; On 17 October 2016 WikiLeaks announced that a ""state party"" had severed the Internet connection of Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy. WikiLeaks blamed US Secretary of State John Kerry for pressuring the Ecuadorian government in severing Assange's Internet, an accusation which the United States State Department denied. &#91; 215 &#93; The Ecuadorian government stated that it had ""temporarily"" severed Assange's Internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents ""impacting on the U.S. election campaign,"" although it also stated that this was not meant to prevent WikiLeaks from operating. &#91; 216 &#93; The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that in 2016, ""WikiLeaks actively sought, and played, a key role in the Russian influence campaign and very likely knew it was assisting a Russian intelligence influence effort."" &#91; 217 &#93; In April 2017 Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that the US Government had prioritised its attempts to arrest Assange. &#91; 156 &#93; On 16 August 2017 US Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher visited Assange and told him that Trump would pardon him on condition that he would agree to say that Russia was not involved in the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leaks . &#91; 218 &#93; &#91; 219 &#93; At his extradition hearings in 2020, Assange's defence team alleged in court that this offer was made ""on instructions from the president"". Trump and Rohrabacher subsequently said they had never spoken about the offer and Rohrabacher said he had made the offer on his own initiative. &#91; 218 &#93; &#91; 219 &#93; &#91; 220 &#93; In 2017, traffic to the WikiLeaks website was diverted by DNS hijacking . &#91; 221 &#93; &#91; 222 &#93; &#91; 223 &#93; In 2018, 11,000 messages from a private chat with WikiLeaks and key supporters from May 2015 through November 2017 was leaked. The messages showed WikiLeaks discussing public relations strategy . &#91; 181 &#93; Later that year, ""tens of thousands"" of files from WikiLeaks laptops was leaked to the Associated Press . &#91; 14 &#93; In January 2019, WikiLeaks sent journalists a ""confidential legal communication not for publication"" with a list of 140 things not to say about Julian Assange that WikiLeaks said were ""false and defamatory"". &#91; 224 &#93; &#91; 225 &#93; Soon after the list was leaked online, WikiLeaks posted a heavily edited version of it. &#91; 226 &#93; The group was criticised and mocked for the list and their handling of it. &#91; 227 &#93; &#91; 228 &#93; &#91; 229 &#93; &#91; 230 &#93; In November 2022, much of the content released by WikiLeaks disappeared from the website, bringing the number of documents from around 10 million to around 3,000. Other reported issues with the site included the websites search ability not working and a broken submission page. &#91; 19 &#93; &#91; 231 &#93; Administration WikiLeaks describes itself as ""an uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking"" &#91; 232 &#93; with its goal being ""to bring important news and information to the public"". &#91; 233 &#93; It is ""a project of the Sunshine Press"", &#91; 234 &#93; &#91; 235 &#93; &#91; 236 &#93; &#91; self-published source &#93; a non-profit organisation based in Iceland. &#91; 237 &#93; &#91; 238 &#93; In 2010, Julian Assange and Kristinn Hrafnsson registered Sunshine Press Productions ehf &#91; 239 &#93; as a business without a headquarters in Iceland. &#91; 240 &#93; &#91; 241 &#93; Assange serves as the Director of Sunshine Press Productions ehf and is on the board of directors with Hrafnsson and Ingi Ragnar Ingason. &#91; 242 &#93; &#91; 243 &#93; &#91; 244 &#93; &#91; 234 &#93; &#91; 245 &#93; &#91; 235 &#93; &#91; 239 &#93; Gavin MacFadyen was a deputy board member. &#91; 243 &#93; In 2010, the WikiLeaks team then consisted of five people working full-time and about 800 people who worked occasionally, none of whom were compensated. &#91; 71 &#93; &#91; 246 &#93; Former WikiLeaks journalist James Ball said in 2011 that ""WikiLeaks is not a conventional organisation. It has no board, no governance, and no effective rules."" &#91; 115 &#93; Editorial policy The scholar and internet activist Ethan Zuckerman suggested that WikiLeaks' editorial policy changes can be viewed as different stages. In the first stage, Zuckerman says WikiLeaks did very little redacting and almost all leaks were accepted, and the main focus was on leakers protecting their identities. &#91; 247 &#93; &#91; 248 &#93; In response to early criticism that having no editorial policy would drive out good material with spam and promote ""automated or indiscriminate publication of confidential records"", &#91; 249 &#93; WikiLeaks established a policy that only accepted only documents ""of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical interest"" (and excluded ""material that is already publicly available""). &#91; 250 &#93; &#91; self-published source &#93; Under the new policy, submissions are reviewed by anonymous WikiLeaks reviewers, and documents that do not meet the editorial criteria are rejected. By 2008, the revised FAQ stated: ""Anybody can post comments to it. [...] Users can publicly discuss documents and analyse their credibility and veracity."" &#91; 251 &#93; &#91; self-published source &#93; After the 2010 reorganisation, posting new comments on leaks was no longer possible. &#91; 75 &#93; &#91; 248 &#93; &#91; 252 &#93; According to Zuckerman, the second stage was ""an advocacy journalism phase"". Zuckerman gave the 2010 release of Collateral Murder as an example, which MIT Technology Review described as a ""highly curated, produced and packaged political statement ... meant to illustrate a political point of view, not merely to inform"". Zuckerman said the third stage involved WikiLeaks working with outside media outlets to curate cables for release. &#91; 247 &#93; &#91; 248 &#93; In December 2010, Zuckerman speculated that the next stage would be for WikiLeaks to release documents all at once or without redacting them. &#91; 248 &#93; In 2016, Assange said that ""often it's the case that we have to do a lot of exploration and marketing of the material we publish ourselves to get a big political impact for it"". &#91; 253 &#93; An embargo agreement WikiLeaks made for the Stratfor leak aimed to ensure that media organisations in smaller countries with less resources that are collaborating with WikiLeaks got a fair shot at covering the stories that involve their country. The Atlantic suggested that the complexity of the embargo had been a source of confusion amongst media partners. &#91; 254 &#93; In 2017, WikiLeaks told Foreign Policy that it sometimes scheduled releases around high-profile events. &#91; 182 &#93; In response to a question in 2010 about whether WikiLeaks would release information that he knew might get someone killed, Assange said that he had instituted a ""harm-minimization policy"". This meant that people named in some documents might be contacted before publication, but that there were also instances where members of WikiLeaks might have ""blood on our hands."" &#91; 50 &#93; One member of WikiLeaks told The New Yorker they were initially uncomfortable with Assange's editorial policy but changed her mind because she thought no one had been unjustly harmed. &#91; 50 &#93; Response In an August 2010 open letter, the non-governmental organisation Reporters Without Borders praised WikiLeaks' past usefulness in exposing ""serious violations of human rights and civil liberties"" but criticised the organisation over a perceived absence of editorial control. &#91; 255 &#93; In a 2013 resolution, the International Federation of Journalists , a trade union of journalists, called WikiLeaks a ""new breed of media organisation"". &#91; 256 &#93; &#91; 257 &#93; Others do not consider WikiLeaks to be journalistic in nature. Media ethicist Kelly McBride of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies wrote in 2011: ""WikiLeaks might grow into a journalist endeavor. But it's not there yet."" &#91; 258 &#93; Bill Keller of The New York Times considers WikiLeaks to be a ""complicated source"" rather than a journalistic partner. &#91; 258 &#93; Prominent First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams writes that WikiLeaks is not a journalistic organisation, but instead ""an organization of political activists; ... a source for journalists; and ... a conduit of leaked information to the press and the public"". &#91; 259 &#93; Financing WikiLeaks is a not-for-profit organisation &#91; 13 &#93; and is funded by private donations, exclusivity contracts &#91; 71 &#93; and concessions from their media partners. &#91; 260 &#93; Assange has said that in some cases legal aid has been donated by media organisations such as the Associated Press , the Los Angeles Times , and the National Newspaper Publishers Association . &#91; 71 &#93; Assange said in early 2010 that WikiLeaks' only revenue consists of donations, but it has considered other options including auctioning early access to documents. &#91; 71 &#93; In September 2010, Assange said that WikiLeaks received millions of dollars in media partnerships, stating it ""win[s] concessions in relation to the number of journalists that will be put on it and how big they'll run with it."" &#91; 260 &#93; In 2010, Assange said the organisation was registered as a library in Australia, a foundation in France, and a newspaper in Sweden, and that it also used two US-based non-profit 501c3 organisations for funding purposes. &#91; 261 &#93; According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, Assange registered Wikileaks ICT in Australia and would not tell anyone how much money was in the Australian fund or what it was being spent on. &#91; 262 &#93; 2010–2013 The Wau Holland Foundation , one of the WikiLeaks' main funding channels, stated that it received more than €900,000 in public donations between October 2009 and December 2010, of which €370,000 has been passed on to WikiLeaks. Hendrik Fulda, vice-president of the Wau Holland Foundation, said that every new WikiLeaks publication brought ""a wave of support"", and that donations were strongest in the weeks after WikiLeaks started publishing leaked diplomatic cables. &#91; 263 &#93; &#91; 264 &#93; According to Assange, WikiLeaks' media partnerships for the cables earned them almost $2 million three months after it started publishing. &#91; 260 &#93; WikiLeaks was paid £150,000 by Al Jazeera and Channel 4 for two five-minute video clips about the Iraq War Logs . &#91; 265 &#93; &#91; 123 &#93; In December 2010, Assange said that WikiLeaks received €100,000 a day at its peak &#91; 266 &#93; and the Wau Holland Foundation stated that Julian Assange and three other permanent employees had begun to receive salaries. &#91; 267 &#93; During 2010, WikiLeaks received over $1.9 million in donations. &#91; 268 &#93; In 2011 donations dropped sharply and WikiLeaks received only around $180,000 in donations, while their expenses increased from $519,000 to $850,000. &#91; 269 &#93; Al Jazeera offered WikiLeaks $1.3 million for access to data. &#91; 120 &#93; During September 2011 WikiLeaks began auctioning items on eBay to raise funds. &#91; 270 &#93; Wikileaks started accepting bitcoin in 2011 as a currency which could not be blocked by financial institutions or a government. &#91; 271 &#93; &#91; 272 &#93; &#91; 273 &#93; In 2012, WikiLeaks raised $68,000 through the Wau Holland Foundation and had expenses more than $507,000. &#91; 269 &#93; Between January and May, Wau Holland Foundation was only able to cover $47,000 in essential infrastructure for WikiLeaks, but not an additional $400,000 that was submitted ""to cover publishing campaigns and logistics in 2012"". &#91; 269 &#93; David Allen Green wrote in The New Statesman in 2011 that there was ""no other sensible way of interpreting"" leaked non-disclosure agreements other than WikliLeaks seeing itself ""as a commercial organisation in the business of owning and selling leaked information"". Becky Hogge , who had signed the agreement, wrote that ""the NDA certainly is poorly drafted, and it may be terrible PR. But remember that WikiLeaks is an organisation conceived and run by computer hackers"" and suggested that WikiLeaks was attempting to ""engage with the commercial media on its own terms"". &#91; 274 &#93; &#91; 275 &#93; Financial",50000

He became a naturalized Russian citizen in 2022. In 2013, while working as a government contractor, Snowden leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA). He was indicted for espionage. &#91; 5 &#93; His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy. In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton , after previous employment with Dell and the CIA . &#91; 6 &#93; Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after taking medical leave from his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii , and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald , Laura Poitras , Barton Gellman , and Ewen MacAskill . Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian , The Washington Post , and other publications. On June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property, &#91; 5 &#93; following which the Department of State revoked his passport . &#91; 7 &#93; Two days later, he flew into Moscow 's Sheremetyevo International Airport , where Russian authorities observed the canceled passport, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, which was repeatedly extended. In October 2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia. &#91; 8 &#93; In September 2022, Snowden was granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin . &#91; 9 &#93; &#91; 10 &#93; His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance , government secrecy , and the balance between national security and information privacy , something that he has said he intended to deal with in prospective interviews. &#91; 11 &#93; Snowden has defended his actions as an effort ""to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them"". &#91; 12 &#93; In early 2016, Snowden became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation , a San Francisco–based nonprofit organization that aims to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance. &#91; 13 &#93; He also has a job at an unnamed Russian IT company. &#91; 14 &#93; In 2017, he married Lindsay Mills . On September 17, 2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published. &#91; 15 &#93; On September 2, 2020, a U.S. federal court ruled in United States v. Moalin that one of the U.S. intelligence 's mass surveillance programs exposed by Snowden was illegal and possibly unconstitutional. &#91; 16 &#93; Personal life [ edit ] Edward Joseph Snowden was born on June 21, 1983, &#91; 17 &#93; in Elizabeth City, North Carolina . &#91; 18 &#93; Snowden's father, Lonnie, was a warrant officer in the U.S. Coast Guard , &#91; 19 &#93; and his mother, Elizabeth, was a clerk at the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland . &#91; 20 &#93; &#91; 21 &#93; &#91; 22 &#93; &#91; 23 &#93; &#91; 24 &#93; His older sister, Jessica, was a lawyer at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C. His maternal grandfather, Edward J. Barrett , &#91; 25 &#93; &#91; 26 &#93; a rear admiral in the Coast Guard, became a senior official with the FBI and was at the Pentagon in 2001 during the September 11 attacks . &#91; 27 &#93; Edward Snowden said that he had expected to work for the federal government, as had the rest of his family. &#91; 28 &#93; His parents divorced in 2001, &#91; 29 &#93; and his father remarried. &#91; 30 &#93; In the early 1990s, while still in grade school, Snowden moved with his family to the area of Fort Meade, Maryland . &#91; 31 &#93; Mononucleosis caused him to miss high school for almost nine months. &#91; 28 &#93; Rather than returning to school, he claims to have passed the GED test. &#91; 12 &#93; &#91; 32 &#93; He took classes at Anne Arundel Community College . &#91; 22 &#93; Although Snowden had no undergraduate college degree, &#91; 33 &#93; he worked online toward a master's degree in computer security at the University of Liverpool , England , in 2011. &#91; 34 &#93; He was interested in Japanese popular culture , had studied the Japanese language , &#91; 35 &#93; and worked for an anime company that had a resident office in the U.S. &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 37 &#93; He also said he had a basic understanding of Mandarin Chinese and was deeply interested in martial arts . At age 20, he listed his religion as Buddhism after working at a U.S. military base in Japan. &#91; 38 &#93; &#91; 39 &#93; &#91; 40 &#93; In September 2019, as part of interviews relating to the release of his memoir Permanent Record , Snowden revealed to The Guardian that he married Lindsay Mills in a courthouse in Moscow. &#91; 15 &#93; The couple's first son was born in December 2020, &#91; 41 &#93; and their second son was born sometime before September 2022. &#91; 1 &#93; Career [ edit ] Because he felt ""an obligation as a human being to help free people from oppression"" during the Iraq War , &#91; 12 &#93; Snowden enlisted in the United States Army on May 7, 2004, and became a Special Forces candidate through its 18X enlistment option. &#91; 42 &#93; He did not complete the training &#91; 17 &#93; due to a leg injury and was given an administrative discharge &#91; 43 &#93; on September 28, 2004. &#91; 44 &#93; Snowden was then employed for less than a year in 2005 as a security guard at the University of Maryland 's Center for Advanced Study of Language, a research center sponsored by the National Security Agency (NSA). &#91; 45 &#93; According to the university, this is not a classified facility, &#91; 46 &#93; though it is heavily guarded. &#91; 47 &#93; In June 2014, Snowden told Wired that his job as a security guard required a high-level security clearance , for which he passed a polygraph exam and underwent a stringent background investigation. &#91; 28 &#93; Employment at the CIA [ edit ] After attending a 2006 job-fair focused on intelligence agencies, Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA. &#91; 28 &#93; &#91; 48 &#93; The Agency assigned him to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia . &#91; 28 &#93; In May 2006, Snowden wrote in Ars Technica that he had no trouble getting work because he was a ""computer wizard"". &#91; 38 &#93; Snowden was sent to the CIA's secret school for technology specialists, where he lived in a hotel for six months while studying and training full-time. &#91; 28 &#93; &#91; 32 &#93; In March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in Geneva , Switzerland , where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security. &#91; 28 &#93; &#91; 49 &#93; Assigned to the U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations , a diplomatic mission representing U.S. interests before the UN and other international organizations , Snowden received a diplomatic passport and a four-bedroom apartment near Lake Geneva . &#91; 28 &#93; According to Greenwald, while there Snowden said he was ""considered the top technical and cybersecurity expert"" in that country and ""was hand-picked by the CIA to support the president at the 2008 NATO summit in Romania "". &#91; 50 &#93; &#91; 51 &#93; A 2016 report from the US House of Representatives Select Committee on Intelligence said that Snowden's official position at CIA was an entry-level technical services officer. &#91; 32 &#93; Snowden described his CIA experience in Geneva as formative, stating that the CIA deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home. Snowden said that when the latter was arrested for drunk driving, a CIA operative offered to help in exchange for the banker becoming an informant. &#91; 52 &#93; Ueli Maurer , President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2013, publicly disputed Snowden's claims in June of that year. ""This would mean that the CIA successfully bribed the Geneva police and judiciary. With all due respect, I just can't imagine it,"" said Maurer. &#91; 53 &#93; In February 2009, following six counseling sessions from his supervisors regarding poor performance, Snowden resigned from the CIA. &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 51 &#93; NSA sub-contractor as an employee at Dell [ edit ] In 2009, Snowden began work as a contractor for Dell , &#91; 55 &#93; which manages computer systems for multiple government agencies. Assigned to an NSA facility at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo , Snowden instructed top officials and military officers on how to defend their networks from Chinese hackers. &#91; 28 &#93; Snowden looked into mass surveillance in China which prompted him to investigate and then expose Washington's mass surveillance program after he was asked in 2009 to brief a conference in Tokyo. &#91; 56 &#93; During his four years with Dell, he rose from supervising NSA computer system upgrades to working as what his résumé termed a ""cyber strategist"" and an ""expert in cyber counterintelligence"" at several U.S. locations. &#91; 57 &#93; In 2010, he had a brief stint in New Delhi , India , where he enrolled himself in a local IT institute to learn core Java programming and advanced ethical hacking . &#91; 58 &#93; In 2011, he returned to Maryland , where he spent a year as system administrator and pre-sales technical engineer on Dell's CIA account. In that capacity, he was consulted by the chiefs of the CIA's technical branches, including the agency's chief information officer and its chief technology officer . &#91; 28 &#93; U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the investigation said Snowden began downloading documents describing the government's electronic spying programs while working for Dell in April 2012. &#91; 55 &#93; Investigators estimated that of the 50,000 to 200,000 documents Snowden gave to Greenwald and Poitras, most were copied by Snowden while working at Dell. &#91; 6 &#93; In March 2012, Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead technologist for the NSA's information-sharing office. &#91; 28 &#93; NSA sub-contractor as an employee at Booz Allen Hamilton [ edit ] On March 15, 2013—three days after what he later called his ""breaking point"" of ""seeing the Director of National Intelligence , James Clapper , directly lie under oath to Congress"" &#91; 59 &#93; —Snowden quit his job at Dell. &#91; 60 &#93; Although he has said his career high annual salary was $200,000, &#91; 61 &#93; Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton , &#91; 61 &#93; where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity. &#91; 62 &#93; At the time of his departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15 months inside the NSA's Hawaii regional operations center , which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea , &#91; 6 &#93; first for Dell and then for two months with Booz Allen Hamilton . &#91; 63 &#93; While intelligence officials have described his position there as a system administrator , Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst, which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world. &#91; 64 &#93; An anonymous source told Reuters that, while in Hawaii, Snowden may have persuaded 20–25 co-workers to give him their login credentials by telling them he needed them to do his job. &#91; 65 &#93; The NSA sent a memo to Congress saying that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal private key to gain greater access to the NSA's computer system. &#91; 66 &#93; &#91; 67 &#93; Snowden disputed the memo, &#91; 68 &#93; saying in January 2014, ""I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers."" &#91; 69 &#93; &#91; 70 &#93; Booz Allen terminated Snowden's employment on June 10, 2013, the day after he went public with his story, and 3 weeks after he had left Hawaii on a leave of absence. &#91; 71 &#93; The former colleague said Snowden was given full administrator privileges with virtually unlimited access to NSA data. Snowden was offered a position on the NSA's elite team of hackers , Tailored Access Operations , but turned it down to join Booz Allen. &#91; 68 &#93; An anonymous source later said that Booz Allen's hiring screeners found possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé but still decided to hire him. &#91; 33 &#93; Snowden's résumé stated that he attended computer-related classes at Johns Hopkins University . A spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins said that the university did not find records to show that Snowden attended the university and suggested that he may instead have attended Advanced Career Technologies, a private for-profit organization that operated as the Computer Career Institute at Johns Hopkins University. &#91; 33 &#93; The University of Maryland University College acknowledged that Snowden had attended a summer session at a UM campus in Asia. Snowden's résumé stated that he estimated he would receive a University of Liverpool computer security master's degree in 2013. The university said that Snowden registered for an online master's degree program in computer security in 2011 but was inactive as a student and had not completed the program. &#91; 33 &#93; In his May 2014 interview with NBC News , Snowden accused the U.S. government of trying to use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a ""low-level analyst."" In his words, he was ""trained as a spy in the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine."" He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure ""in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading."" &#91; 27 &#93; In a June interview with Globo TV , Snowden reiterated that he ""was actually functioning at a very senior level."" &#91; 72 &#93; In a July interview with The Guardian , Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, ""I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don't understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting."" &#91; 73 &#93; Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, ""I would sit down with the CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job to come up with a way to fix them."" &#91; 28 &#93; During his time as an NSA analyst, directing the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment when he and his colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18- to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly: ...thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people. Snowden observed that this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the "" fringe benefits "" of the work. &#91; 74 &#93; Whistleblower status [ edit ] Snowden has described himself as a whistleblower, &#91; 75 &#93; a description used by many sources, including CNBC , &#91; 76 &#93; The New Yorker , &#91; 77 &#93; Reuters, &#91; 78 &#93; and The Guardian , &#91; 79 &#93; among others. &#91; 80 &#93; &#91; 81 &#93; &#91; 82 &#93; The term has both informal and legal meanings. Snowden said that he had told multiple employees and two supervisors about his concerns, but the NSA disputes his claim. &#91; 83 &#93; Snowden elaborated in January 2014, saying ""[I] made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co-workers, supervisors, and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen. The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled, but no one was willing to risk their jobs, families, and possibly even freedom to go to &#32;&#91; sic &#93; through what [Thomas Andrews] Drake did."" &#91; 70 &#93; &#91; 84 &#93; In March 2014, during testimony to the European Parliament, Snowden wrote that before revealing classified information he had reported ""clearly problematic programs"" to ten officials, who he said did nothing in response. &#91; 85 &#93; In a May 2014 interview, Snowden told NBC News that after bringing his concerns about the legality of the NSA spying programs to officials, he was told to stay silent on the matter. He said that the NSA had copies of emails he sent to their Office of General Counsel, oversight, and compliance personnel broaching ""concerns about the NSA's interpretations of its legal authorities. I had raised these complaints not just officially in writing through email, but to my supervisors, to my colleagues, in more than one office."" &#91; 27 &#93; In May 2014, U.S. officials released a single email that Snowden had written in April 2013 inquiring about legal authorities but said that they had found no other evidence that Snowden had expressed his concerns to someone in an oversight position. &#91; 86 &#93; In June 2014, the NSA said it had not been able to find any records of Snowden raising internal complaints about the agency's operations. &#91; 87 &#93; That same month, Snowden explained that he had not produced the communiqués in question because of the ongoing nature of the dispute, disclosing for the first time that ""I am working with the NSA in regard to these records and we're going back and forth, so I don't want to reveal everything that will come out."" &#91; 88 &#93; Self-description as a whistleblower and attribution as such in news reports does not determine whether he qualifies as a whistleblower within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (5 USC 2303(b)(8)-(9); Pub. Law 101-12). However, Snowden's potential status as a whistleblower under the 1989 Act is not directly addressed in the criminal complaint against him in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (see below) (Case No. 1:13 CR 265 (0MH)). These and similar and related issues are discussed in an essay by David Pozen, in a chapter of the book Whistleblowing Nation , published in March 2020, &#91; 89 &#93; an adaptation of which &#91; 90 &#93; also appeared on Lawfare Blog in March 2019. &#91; 91 &#93; The unclassified portion of a September 15, 2016, report by the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), initiated by the chairman and Ranking Member in August 2014, and posted on the website of the Federation of American Scientists , concluded that Snowden was not a whistleblower in the sense required by the Whistleblower Protection Act. &#91; 92 &#93; The bulk of the report is classified. Surveillance disclosures [ edit ] Main article: 2010s global surveillance disclosures Size and scope of disclosures [ edit ] The exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown, &#91; 93 &#93; but Australian officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence files &#91; 94 &#93; and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British intelligence files were included. &#91; 95 &#93; NSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 NSA documents. &#91; 96 &#93; Later estimates provided by U.S. officials were in the order of 1.7 million, &#91; 97 &#93; a number that originally came from Department of Defense talking points. &#91; 98 &#93; In July 2014, The Washington Post reported on a cache previously provided by Snowden from domestic NSA operations consisting of ""roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long, and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts."" &#91; 99 &#93; A DIA report declassified in June 2015 said that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files, more than he downloaded from the NSA. &#91; 98 &#93; Potential impact on U.S. national security [ edit ] In March 2014, Army General Martin Dempsey , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told the House Armed Services Committee , ""The vast majority of the documents that Snowden ... exfiltrated from our highest levels of security ... had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities. The vast majority of those were related to our military capabilities, operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures."" &#91; 100 &#93; When asked in a May 2014 interview to quantify the number of documents Snowden stole, retired NSA director Keith Alexander said there was no accurate way of counting what he took, but Snowden may have downloaded more than a million documents. &#91; 101 &#93; The September 15, 2016 HPSCI report &#91; 92 &#93; estimated the number of downloaded documents at 1.5 million. In a 2013 Associated Press interview, Glenn Greenwald stated: In order to take documents with him that proved that what he was saying was true he had to take ones that included very sensitive, detailed blueprints of how the NSA does what they do. &#91; 102 &#93; Thus, the Snowden documents allegedly contained sensitive NSA blueprints detailing how the NSA operates, which would allow someone who read them to evade or even duplicate NSA surveillance. Further, a 2015 New York Times article &#91; 103 &#93; reported that the Islamic State group had studied Snowden's revelations about how the United States gathered information on militants. As a result, the group's top leaders used couriers or encrypted channels to avoid being tracked or monitored by Western analysts. According to Snowden, he did not indiscriminately turn over documents to journalists, stating that ""I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest. There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over"" &#91; 12 &#93; and that ""I have to screen everything before releasing it to journalists ... If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country."" &#91; 62 &#93; Despite these measures, the improper redaction of a document by The New York Times resulted in the exposure of intelligence activity against al-Qaeda . &#91; 104 &#93; In June 2014, the NSA's recently installed director, U.S. Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers , said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done was not significant enough to conclude that ""the sky is falling."" &#91; 105 &#93; Nevertheless, in February 2015, Rogers said that Snowden's disclosures had a material impact on the NSA's detection and evaluation of terrorist activities worldwide. &#91; 106 &#93; On June 14, 2015, the London Sunday Times reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence services had decrypted more than 1 million classified files in the Snowden cache, forcing the UK's MI6 intelligence agency to move agents out of live operations in hostile countries. Sir David Omand , a former director of the UK's GCHQ intelligence gathering agency, described it as a huge strategic setback that was harming Britain, America, and their NATO allies. The Sunday Times said it was not clear whether Russia and China stole Snowden's data or whether Snowden voluntarily handed it over to remain at liberty in Hong Kong and Moscow. &#91; 107 &#93; &#91; 108 &#93; In April 2015, the Henry Jackson Society , a British neoconservative think tank , published a report claiming that Snowden's intelligence leaks negatively impacted Britain's ability to fight terrorism and organized crime. &#91; 109 &#93; Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International , criticized the report for, in his opinion, presuming that the public became concerned about privacy only after Snowden's disclosures. &#91; 110 &#93; Release of NSA documents [ edit ] Snowden's decision to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March 2007 posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station. &#91; 111 &#93; Snowden later made contact with Glenn Greenwald, a journalist working at The Guardian . &#91; 112 &#93; He contacted Greenwald anonymously as ""Cincinnatus"" &#91; 113 &#93; &#91; 114 &#93; and said he had sensitive documents that he would like to share. &#91; 115 &#93; Greenwald found the measures that the source asked him to take to secure their communications, such as encrypting email, too annoying to employ. Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras in January 2013. &#91; 116 &#93; According to Poitras, Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her New York Times article about NSA whistleblower William Binney . &#91; 117 &#93; What originally attracted Snowden to Greenwald and Poitras was a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras's controversial films had made her a target of the government. &#91; 115 &#93; Greenwald began working with Snowden in either February &#91; 118 &#93; or April 2013, after Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New York City, at which point Snowden began providing documents to them. &#91; 112 &#93; Barton Gellman , writing for The Washington Post , says his first direct contact was on May 16, 2013. &#91; 119 &#93; According to Gellman, Snowden approached Greenwald after the Post declined to guarantee publication within 72 hours of all 41 PowerPoint slides that Snowden had leaked exposing the PRISM electronic data mining program, and to publish online an encrypted code allowing Snowden to later prove that he was the source. &#91; 119 &#93; Snowden communicated using encrypted email , &#91; 116 &#93; and going by the codename "" Verax "". He asked not to be quoted at length for fear of identification by stylometry . &#91; 119 &#93; According to Gellman, before their first meeting in person, Snowden wrote, ""I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions and that the return of this information to the public marks my end."" &#91; 119 &#93; Snowden also told Gellman that until the articles were published, the journalists working with him would also be at mortal risk from the United States Intelligence Community ""if they think you are the single point of failure that could stop this disclosure and make them the sole owner of this information."" &#91; 119 &#93; In May 2013, Snowden was permitted temporary leave from his position at the NSA in Hawaii, on the pretext of receiving treatment for his epilepsy . &#91; 12 &#93; In mid-May, Snowden gave an electronic interview to Poitras and Jacob Appelbaum which was published weeks later by Der Spiegel . &#91; 120 &#93; After disclosing the copied documents, Snowden promised that nothing would stop subsequent disclosures. In June 2013, he said, ""All I can say right now is the US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped."" &#91; 121 &#93; Publication [ edit ] On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong, &#91; 122 &#93; where he was staying when the initial articles based on the leaked documents were published, &#91; 123 &#93; beginning with The Guardian on June 5. &#91; 124 &#93; Greenwald later said Snowden disclosed 9,000 to 10,000 documents. &#91; 125 &#93; Within months, documents had been obtained and published by media outlets worldwide, most notably The Guardian (Britain), Der Spiegel (Germany), The Washington Post and The New York Times (U.S.), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), and similar outlets in Sweden , Canada , Italy , Netherlands , Norway , Spain , and Australia . &#91; 126 &#93; In 2014, NBC broke its first story based on the leaked documents. &#91; 127 &#93; In February 2014, for reporting based on Snowden's leaks, journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman and The Guardian′ s Ewen MacAskill were honored as co-recipients of the 2013 George Polk Award , which they dedicated to Snowden. &#91; 128 &#93; The NSA reporting by these journalists also earned The Guardian and The Washington Post the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service &#91; 129 &#93; for exposing the ""widespread surveillance"" and for helping to spark a ""huge public debate about the extent of the government's spying"". The Guardian &#39; s chief editor, Alan Rusbridger , credited Snowden for having performed a public service. &#91; 130 &#93; Revelations [ edit ] Main article: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present) See also: PRISM (surveillance program) §&#160;Responses to disclosures Slide from an NSA presentation on ""Google Cloud Exploitation"" from its MUSCULAR program; &#91; 131 &#93; the sketch shows where the ""Public Internet"" meets the internal ""Google Cloud"" where user data resides. &#91; 132 &#93; Data visualization of U.S. intelligence black budget (2013) The ongoing publication of leaked documents has revealed previously unknown details of a global surveillance apparatus run by the NSA &#91; 133 &#93; in close cooperation with three of its four Five Eyes partners: Australia's ASD , &#91; 134 &#93; the UK's GCHQ , &#91; 135 &#93; and Canada's CSEC . &#91; 136 &#93; PRISM: a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Microsoft , Google, Apple , Yahoo , Facebook and YouTube On June 5, 2013, media reports documenting the existence and functions of classified surveillance programs and their scope began and continued throughout the entire year. The first program to be revealed was PRISM, which allows for direct access to data on the servers of Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple. &#91; 137 &#93; &#91; 138 &#93; Barton Gellman of The Washington Post was the first journalist to report on Snowden's documents. He said the U.S. government urged him not to specify by name which companies were involved, but Gellman decided that to name them ""would make it real to Americans."" &#91; 139 &#93; Reports also revealed details of Tempora , a secret British surveillance program run by the NSA's British partner, GCHQ. &#91; 140 &#93; The initial reports included details about NSA call database , Boundless Informant , and a secret court order requiring Verizon to hand the NSA millions of Americans' phone records daily, &#91; 141 &#93; as well as the surveillance of phone and Internet records of French citizens, with specific targets of French people either ""suspected of association with terrorist activities"" or in ""the worlds of business, politics or French state administration."" &#91; 142 &#93; &#91; 143 &#93; &#91; 144 &#93; XKeyscore , an analytical tool that allows for collection of ""almost anything done on the internet,"" was described by The Guardian as a program that shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements: ""I, sitting at my desk [could] wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email."" &#91; 145 &#93; The NSA's top-secret black budget , obtained from Snowden by The Washington Post , exposed the successes and failures of the 16 spy agencies comprising the U.S. intelligence community, &#91; 146 &#93; and revealed that the NSA was paying U.S. private tech companies for clandestine access to their communications networks. &#91; 147 &#93; The agencies were allotted $52&#160;billion for the 2013 fiscal year. &#91; 148 &#93; It was revealed that the NSA was harvesting millions of email and instant messaging contact lists, &#91; 149 &#93; searching email content, &#91; 150 &#93; tracking and mapping the location of cell phones, &#91; 151 &#93; undermining attempts at encryption via Bullrun &#91; 152 &#93; &#91; 153 &#93; and that the agency was using cookies to piggyback on the same tools used by Internet advertisers ""to pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster surveillance."" &#91; 154 &#93; The NSA was shown to be secretly accessing Yahoo and Google data centers to collect information from hundreds of millions of account holders worldwide by tapping undersea cables using the MUSCULAR surveillance program. &#91; 131 &#93; &#91; 132 &#93; The NSA, the CIA and GCHQ spied on users of Second Life , Xbox Live and World of Warcraft , and attempted to recruit would-be informants from the sites, according to documents revealed in December 2013. &#91; 155 &#93; &#91; 156 &#93; Leaked documents showed NSA agents also spied on their own ""love interests"", a practice NSA employees termed LOVEINT . &#91; 157 &#93; &#91; 158 &#93; The NSA was shown to be tracking the online sexual activity of people they termed ""radicalizers"" in order to discredit them. &#91; 159 &#93; Following the revelation of Blackpearl, a program targeting private networks, the NSA was accused of extending beyond its primary mission of national security. The agency's intelligence-gathering operations had targeted, among others, oil giant Petrobras , Brazil's largest company. &#91; 160 &#93; The NSA and the GCHQ were also shown to be surveilling charities including UNICEF and Médecins du Monde , as well as allies such as European Commissioner Joaquín Almunia and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . &#91; 161 &#93; In October 2013, Glenn Greenwald said ""the most shocking and significant stories are the ones we are still working on, and have yet to publish."" &#91; 162 &#93; In November, The Guardian &#39; s editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger said that only one percent of the documents had been published. &#91; 163 &#93; In December, Australia's Minister for Defence David Johnston said his government assumed the worst was yet to come. &#91; 164 &#93; By October 2013, Snowden's disclosures had created tensions &#91; 165 &#93; &#91; 166 &#93; between the U.S. and some of its close allies after they revealed that the U.S. had spied on Brazil , France , Mexico , &#91; 167 &#93; Britain, &#91; 168 &#93; China, &#91; 169 &#93; Germany , &#91; 170 &#93; and Spain, &#91; 171 &#93; as well as 35 world leaders, &#91; 172 &#93; most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who said ""spying among friends"" was unacceptable &#91; 173 &#93; &#91; 174 &#93; and compared the NSA with the Stasi . &#91; 175 &#93; Leaked documents published by Der Spiegel in 2014 appeared to show that the NSA had targeted 122 high-ranking leaders. &#91; 176 &#93; An NSA mission statement titled ""SIGINT Strategy 2012-2016"" affirmed that the NSA had plans for the continued expansion of surveillance activities. Their stated goal was to ""dramatically increase mastery of the global network"" and to acquire adversaries' data from ""anyone, anytime, anywhere."" &#91; 177 &#93; Leaked slides revealed in Greenwald's book No Place to Hide , released in May 2014, showed that the NSA's stated objective was to ""Collect it All,"" ""Process it All,"" ""Exploit it All,"" ""Partner it All,"" ""Sniff it All"" and ""Know it All."" &#91; 178 &#93; Snowden said in a January 2014 interview with German television that the NSA does not limit its data collection to national security issues, accusing the agency of conducting industrial espionage . Using the example of German company Siemens , he said, ""If there's information at Siemens that's beneficial to US national interests—even if it doesn't have anything to do with national security—then they'll take that information nevertheless."" &#91; 179 &#93; In the wake of Snowden's revelations and in response to an inquiry from the Left Party , Germany's domestic security agency Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) investigated and found no concrete evidence that the U.S. conducted economic or industrial espionage in Germany. &#91; 180 &#93; In February 2014, during testimony to the European Union, Snowden said of the remaining undisclosed programs, ""I will leave the public interest determinations as to which of these may be safely disclosed to responsible journalists in coordination with government stakeholders."" &#91; 181 &#93; In March 2014, documents disclosed by Glenn Greenwald writing for The Intercept showed the NSA, in cooperation with the GCHQ, has plans to infect millions of computers with malware using a program called TURBINE . &#91; 182 &#93; Revelations included information about QUANTUMHAND , a program through which the NSA set up a fake Facebook server to intercept connections. &#91; 182 &#93; According to a report in The Washington Post in July 2014, relying on information furnished by Snowden, 90% of those placed under surveillance in the U.S. are ordinary Americans and are not the intended targets. The newspaper said it had examined documents including emails, message texts, and online accounts that support the claim. &#91; 183 &#93; In an August 2014 interview, Snowden for the first time disclosed a cyberwarfare program in the works, codenamed MonsterMind , that would automate the detection of a foreign cyberattack as it began and automatically fire back. ""These attacks can be spoofed ,"" said Snowden. ""You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?"" &#91; 28 &#93; Motivations [ edit ] Snowden speaks about the NSA leaks, in Hong Kong, filmed by Laura Poitras. Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms. &#91; 6 &#93; After the disclosures, his identity was made public by The Guardian at his request on June 9, 2013. &#91; 118 &#93; ""I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,"" he said. ""My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them."" &#91; 122 &#93; Snowden said he wanted to ""embolden others to step forward"" by demonstrating that ""they can win."" &#91; 119 &#93; He also said that the system for reporting problems did not work. ""You have to report wrongdoing to those most responsible for it."" He cited a lack of whistleblower protection for government contractors, the use of the Espionage Act of 1917 to prosecute leakers and the belief that had he used internal mechanisms to ""sound the alarm,"" his revelations ""would have been buried forever."" &#91; 111 &#93; &#91; 184 &#93; In December 2013, upon learning that a U.S. federal judge had ruled the collection of U.S. phone metadata conducted by the NSA as likely unconstitutional, Snowden said, ""I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts ... today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights."" &#91; 185 &#93; In January 2014, Snowden said his ""breaking point"" was ""seeing the Director of National Intelligence , James Clapper , directly lie under oath to Congress."" &#91; 59 &#93; This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013—three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald, &#91; 112 &#93; and nine months after the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads during the summer of 2012 &#91; 6 &#93; —in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans. &#91; 186 &#93; Snowden said, ""There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs."" &#91; 187 &#93; In March 2014, Snowden said he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing. &#91; 85 &#93; Similarities to previous espionage incidents [ edit ] This section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources .

Agee died in Cuba. Philby, like Snowden, fled to Russia where he died in exile. Beyond this, the similarities are more tenuous, as unlike Snowden, Agee and Philby were double agents for the KGB. New Zealand [ edit ] Snowden made a number of claims about the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) of New Zealand . He accused the agency of conducting surveillance on New Zealand citizens and engaging in espionage between 2008 and 2016, when John Key served as the Prime Minister of New Zealand . &#91; 188 &#93; &#91; 189 &#93; Flight from the United States [ edit ] Hong Kong [ edit ] In May 2013, Snowden quit his job, telling his supervisors he required epilepsy treatment, but instead fled the United States for Hong Kong on May 10. He chose Hong Kong for its ""spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent"" at the time. &#91; 12 &#93; &#91; 190 &#93; Snowden remained in his room at the Mira Hotel after his arrival in the city, rarely going out. &#91; 191 &#93; Hong Kong rally to support Snowden, June 15, 2013 Snowden vowed to challenge any extradition attempt by the U.S. government, and engaged Hong Kong-based Canadian human rights lawyer Robert Tibbo as a legal adviser. &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 192 &#93; &#91; 193 &#93; Snowden told the South China Morning Post that he planned to remain in Hong Kong for as long as its government would permit. &#91; 194 &#93; &#91; 195 &#93; Snowden also told the Post that ""the United States government has committed a tremendous number of crimes against Hong Kong [and] the PRC as well,"" &#91; 196 &#93; going on to identify Chinese Internet Protocol addresses that the NSA monitored and stating that the NSA collected text-message data for Hong Kong residents. Glenn Greenwald said Snowden was motivated by a need to ""ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China."" &#91; 197 &#93; After leaving the Mira Hotel, Snowden was housed for two weeks in several apartments by other refugees seeking asylum in Hong Kong, an arrangement set up by Tibbo to hide from the US authorities. &#91; 198 &#9",50000

The term ""Five Eyes"" originated as shorthand for a ""AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US Eyes Only"" ( AUSCANNZUKUS ) releasability caveat . &#91; 5 &#93; The origins of the FVEY can be traced to informal, secret meetings during World War II between British and American code-breakers that took place before the US formally entered the war. &#91; 6 &#93; The alliance was formalized in the post-war era by the UKUSA Agreement in 1946. As the Cold War deepened, the intelligence sharing arrangement was formalised under the ECHELON surveillance system in the 1960s. &#91; 7 &#93; This system was developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc ; it is now used to monitor communications worldwide. &#91; 8 &#93; &#91; 9 &#93; The FVEY expanded its surveillance capabilities during the course of the "" war on terror "", with much emphasis placed on monitoring the Internet . The alliance has grown into a robust global surveillance mechanism, adapting to new domains such as international terrorism , cyberattacks , and contemporary regional conflicts. The alliance's activities, often shrouded in secrecy, have occasionally come under scrutiny for their implications on privacy and civil liberties, sparking debates and legal challenges. In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a debate in the European Parliament and, to a lesser extent, the United States Congress and British Parliament . Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden described the Five Eyes as a ""supra-national intelligence organisation that does not answer to the known laws of its own countries"". &#91; 10 &#93; Disclosures in the 2010s revealed FVEY was spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other, although the FVEY nations maintain this was done legally. &#91; 11 &#93; &#91; 12 &#93; Five Eyes is among the most comprehensive espionage alliances. &#91; 13 &#93; Since processed intelligence is gathered from multiple sources, the information shared is not restricted to signals intelligence (SIGINT) and often involves military intelligence (MILINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT). Five Eyes remains a key element in the intelligence and security landscape of each member country, providing them a strategic advantage in understanding and responding to global events. Organisations [ edit ] The following table provides an overview of most of the FVEY agencies that share data . &#91; 2 &#93; Main agencies sharing data as part of Five Eyes alliance, by country Country Agency Abbreviation Role &#91; 2 &#93; Australia Australian Secret Intelligence Service ASIS Human intelligence Australian Signals Directorate ASD Signal intelligence Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ASIO Security intelligence Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation AGO Geo intelligence Defence Intelligence Organisation DIO Defence intelligence Canada Canadian Forces Intelligence Command CFINTCOM Defence intelligence, geo intelligence, human intelligence Communications Security Establishment CSE Signal intelligence Canadian Security Intelligence Service CSIS Human intelligence, security intelligence Royal Canadian Mounted Police RCMP Security intelligence New Zealand Directorate of Defence Intelligence and Security DDIS Defence intelligence Government Communications Security Bureau GCSB Signal intelligence New Zealand Security Intelligence Service NZSIS Human intelligence, security intelligence United Kingdom Defence Intelligence DI Defence intelligence Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ Signal intelligence Security Service MI5 Security intelligence Secret Intelligence Service MI6, SIS Human intelligence United States Central Intelligence Agency CIA Human intelligence Defense Intelligence Agency DIA Defense intelligence Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI Security intelligence National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency NGA Geo intelligence National Security Agency NSA Signal intelligence History [ edit ] Origins (1941–1950s) [ edit ] The cover page of the first version of the secret UKUSA Agreement in 1946, which was disclosed to the public in 2011 The informal origins of the Five Eyes alliance were secret meetings between British and US code-breakers at the British code-breaking establishment Bletchley Park in February 1941, before the US entry into the war. &#91; 14 &#93; The first record of these meetings is a February 1941 diary entry from Alastair Denniston , head of Bletchley Park, reading ""The Ys are coming!"" with ""Ys"" referring to "" Yanks "". An entry from 10 February reads ""Ys arrive"". British and US intelligence shared extremely confidential information, including that the British had broken the German Enigma code and that the US had broken the Japanese Purple code. For the rest of the war, key figures like Denniston and code-breaking expert Alan Turing travelled back and forth across the Atlantic. The informal relationship established for wartime signals intelligence developed into a formal, signed agreement at the start of the Cold War . &#91; 15 &#93; The formal Five Eyes alliance can be traced back to the August 1941 Atlantic Charter , which laid out Allied goals for the post-war world. On 17 May 1943, the UK and US governments signed the British–US Communication Intelligence Agreement, also known as the BRUSA Agreement , to facilitate co-operation between the US War Department and the British Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) . On 5 March 1946, the two governments formalized their secret treaty as the UKUSA Agreement , the basis for all signal intelligence cooperation between the NSA and GCHQ up to the present. &#91; 16 &#93; &#91; 17 &#93; UKUSA was extended to include Canada in 1948, followed by Norway in 1952, Denmark in 1954, West Germany in 1955, and Australia and New Zealand in 1956. &#91; 17 &#93; These countries participated in the alliance as ""third parties"". By 1955, a newer version of the UKUSA Agreement officially acknowledged the formal status of the remaining Five Eyes countries with the following statement: At this time only Canada, Australia and New Zealand will be regarded as UKUSA-collaborating Commonwealth countries. &#91; 17 &#93; Cold War [ edit ] During the Cold War , GCHQ and the NSA shared intelligence on the Soviet Union , China, and several eastern European countries known as ""Exotics"". &#91; 18 &#93; Over the course of several decades, the ECHELON surveillance network was developed to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies. &#91; 19 &#93; In 1953, SIS and the CIA jointly orchestrated the overthrow of Iran's Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh . &#91; 20 &#93; &#91; 21 &#93; &#91; 22 &#93; &#91; 23 &#93; From 1955 through 1975 during the Vietnam War , Australian and New Zealander operators in the Asia-Pacific region worked to directly support the United States while GCHQ operators stationed in British Hong Kong as part of GCHQ Hong Kong were tasked with monitoring North Vietnamese air defence networks. &#91; 24 &#93; &#91; 25 &#93; In 1961, SIS and the CIA jointly orchestrated the assassination of the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba , an operation authorized by out-going US President Dwight D. Eisenhower the year before in 1960. &#91; 26 &#93; &#91; 27 &#93; &#91; 28 &#93; In 1973, the ASIS and the CIA jointly orchestrated the overthrow of Chile's President Salvador Allende . &#91; 29 &#93; &#91; 30 &#93; &#91; 31 &#93; &#91; 32 &#93; Over a period of at least five years in the 1970s, a senior officer named Ian George Peacock, who was in the counterespionage unit of Australia's ASIO , stole highly classified intelligence documents that had been shared with Australia and sold them to the Soviet Union . Peacock held the title of supervisor-E (espionage) and had top-secret security clearance. He retired from the ASIO in 1983 and died in 2006. &#91; 33 &#93; During the Falklands War in 1982, the United Kingdom received intelligence data from its FVEY allies as well as from third parties like Norway and France. &#91; 34 &#93; &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 36 &#93; In 1989, during the Tiananmen Square protests , SIS and the CIA took part in Operation Yellowbird to exfiltrate dissidents from China . &#91; 37 &#93; In the aftermath of the Gulf War in 1991, an ASIS technician bugged Kuwaiti government offices for SIS . &#91; 35 &#93; ECHELON network disclosures (1972–2000) [ edit ] By the end of the 20th century, the FVEY members had developed the ECHELON surveillance network into a global system capable of collecting massive amounts of private and commercial communications including telephone calls , fax , email , and other data traffic . The network's information comes from intercepted communication bearers such as satellite transmissions and public switched telephone networks . &#91; 38 &#93; Two of the FVEY information collection mechanisms are the PRISM program and the Upstream collection system. The PRISM program gathers user information from technology firms such as Google , Apple , and Microsoft ; while the Upstream system gathers information directly from civilian communications as they travel through infrastructure like fiber cables . &#91; 39 &#93; The program was first disclosed to the public in 1972 when a former NSA communications analyst reported to Ramparts magazine that the Agency had developed technology that ""could crack all Soviet codes"". &#91; 40 &#93; In a 1988 piece in the New Statesman called ""Somebody's listening"", Duncan Campbell revealed the existence of ECHELON , an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence . The story detailed how eavesdropping operations were not only being employed in the interests of 'national security,' but were regularly abused for corporate espionage in the service of US business interests. &#91; 41 &#93; The piece passed largely unnoticed outside of journalism circles. &#91; 42 &#93; In 1996, New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager provided a detailed description of ECHELON in a book titled Secret Power – New Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network . The European Parliament cited the book in a 1998 report titled "" An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control "" (PE 168.184). &#91; 43 &#93; On 16 March 2000, the Parliament called for a resolution on the Five Eyes and its ECHELON surveillance network which would have called for the ""complete dismantling of ECHELON"". &#91; 44 &#93; Three months later, the European Parliament established the Temporary Committee on ECHELON to investigate the ECHELON surveillance network. However, according to a number of European politicians such as Esko Seppänen of Finland, the European Commission hindered these investigations . &#91; 45 &#93; In the United States, congressional legislators warned that the ECHELON system could be used to monitor US citizens . &#91; 46 &#93; On 14 May 2001, the US government cancelled all meetings with the Temporary Committee on ECHELON. &#91; 47 &#93; According to a BBC report from May 2001, ""The US Government still refuses to admit that Echelon even exists."" &#91; 19 &#93; War on Terror (since 2001) [ edit ] See also: Global surveillance In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , Five Eyes members greatly increased their surveillance capabilities as part of the global war on terror . During the run-up to the Iraq War , the communications of UN weapons inspector Hans Blix were monitored by the Five Eyes. &#91; 48 &#93; &#91; 49 &#93; Around the same time, British agents bugged the office of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan . &#91; 50 &#93; &#91; 51 &#93; An NSA memo detailed Five Eyes plans to increase surveillance on the UN delegations of six countries as part of a ""dirty tricks"" campaign to pressure these six countries to vote in favour of using force against Iraq. &#91; 50 &#93; &#91; 52 &#93; &#91; 53 &#93; SIS and the CIA formed a surveillance partnership with Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi to spy on Libyan dissidents in the West in exchange for permission to use Libya as a base for extraordinary renditions . &#91; 54 &#93; &#91; 55 &#93; &#91; 56 &#93; &#91; 57 &#93; &#91; 58 &#93; As of 2010 &#91;update&#93; , Five Eyes-affiliated agencies also have access to SIPRNet , the US government's classified version of the Internet. &#91; 59 &#93; In 2013, documents leaked by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the existence of numerous surveillance programs jointly operated by the Five Eyes. The following list includes several notable examples reported in the media: PRISM – Operated by the NSA together with GCHQ and the ASD &#91; 60 &#93; &#91; 61 &#93; XKeyscore – Operated by the NSA with contributions from the ASD and the GCSB &#91; 62 &#93; Tempora – Operated by GCHQ with contributions from the NSA &#91; 63 &#93; &#91; 64 &#93; MUSCULAR – Operated by GCHQ and the NSA &#91; 65 &#93; STATEROOM – Operated by the ASD, CIA , CSE , GCHQ, and NSA &#91; 66 &#93; In March 2014, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Australia to stop spying on East Timor . This marks the first such restrictions imposed on a member of the FVEY. &#91; 67 &#93; Competition with China (since 2018) [ edit ] On 1 December 2018, Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou , a Huawei executive, at Vancouver International Airport to face charges of fraud and conspiracy in the United States. &#91; 68 &#93; China responded by arresting two Canadian nationals. According to the South China Morning Post , analysts saw this conflict as the beginning of a direct clash between China's government and governments of the Five Eyes alliance. &#91; 69 &#93; In the months that followed, the United States restricted technology exchanges with China. &#91; 70 &#93; The newspaper reported that these events were seen by Beijing as a ""fight ... waged with the world’s oldest intelligence alliance, the Five Eyes."" &#91; 71 &#93; Starting in 2019, Australian parliamentarians as well as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prompted the United Kingdom not to use Huawei technology in its 5G network . &#91; 72 &#93; In 2021, the UK Government announced it no longer planned to use Huawei's 5G technology. &#91; 73 &#93; In November 2020, the Five Eyes alliance criticised China's rules disqualifying elected legislators in Hong Kong. &#91; 74 &#93; In mid-April 2021, the New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta issued a statement that New Zealand would not let the Five Eyes alliance dictate its bilateral relationship with China and that New Zealand was uncomfortable with expanding the remit of the intelligence grouping. In response, the Australian Government expressed concern that Wellington was undermining collective efforts to combat what it regarded as Chinese aggression. &#91; 75 &#93; &#91; 76 &#93; New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern echoed Mahuta's remarks and claimed that while New Zealand was still committed to the Five Eyes alliance, it would not use the network as its first point of communication for non-security matters. While The Telegraph &#39;s defence editor Con Coughlin and British Conservative Member of Parliament Bob Seely criticised New Zealand for undermining the Five Eyes' efforts to present a united front against Beijing, the Chinese Global Times praised New Zealand for putting its own national interests over the Five Eyes. &#91; 77 &#93; &#91; 78 &#93; &#91; 79 &#93; Following the 2023 New Zealand general election , the new New Zealand Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters promised closer cooperation with Five Eyes partners. &#91; 80 &#93; According to The Economist and Foreign Policy magazine, New Zealand foreign policy under the new National-led coalition government had shifted away from China in favour of closer relations with its traditional Five Eyes partners. &#91; 81 &#93; During an interview with The Economist , Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said that he was looking to ""diversify New Zealand's diplomatic and trade relationships away from its reliance on China"". &#91; 82 &#93; In late April 2021, the Global Times reported that China's Ministry of State Security will monitor employees of companies and organisations considered to be at risk of foreign infiltration while they travel to the Five Eyes countries. These employees will be required to report their travel destinations, agendas, and meetings with foreign personnel to Chinese authorities. Other security measures include undergoing ""pre-departure spying education"", and using different electronic devices while at home and while abroad. &#91; 83 &#93; &#91; 84 &#93; In mid-December 2021, the United States Secretary of State , the Foreign Ministers of Australia , Canada , and New Zealand , and the UK Foreign Secretary issued a joint statement criticising the exclusion of opposition candidates by Hong Kong national security law and urging China to respect human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration . &#91; 85 &#93; &#91; 86 &#93; In response, the Chinese Government claimed the Hong Kong elections were fair and criticised the Five Eyes for interfering in Hong Kong's domestic affairs . &#91; 87 &#93; &#91; 88 &#93; 2023 meeting [ edit ] The Five Eyes leaders held their first known public meeting &#91; 89 &#93; at Stanford University 's Hoover Institution &#91; 90 &#93; in California in the US. They had been meeting privately nearby in Palo Alto . Present were: Australia's ASIO Director General Mike Burgess , Canada's CSIS head David Vigneault , New Zealand's NZSIS Director General Andrew Hampton , the UK's Director General of MI5 Ken McCallum , and the US's FBI Director Christopher Wray . &#91; 91 &#93; They made public statements on topics such as the death in Canada of Hardeep Singh Nijjar &#91; 90 &#93; and Chinese state-backed hackers . &#91; 89 &#93; Domestic espionage sharing controversy [ edit ] The Five Eyes alliance is sort of an artifact of the post World War II era where the Anglophone countries are the major powers banded together to sort of co-operate and share the costs of intelligence gathering infrastructure. ... The result of this was over decades and decades some sort of a supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the laws of its own countries. — Edward Snowden &#91; 10 &#93; One of the Five Eyes' core principles is that members do not spy on other governments in the alliance. US Director of National Intelligence Admiral Dennis C. Blair said in 2013, ""We do not spy on each other. We just ask."" &#91; 92 &#93; However, in recent years, FVEY documents have shown that member agencies are intentionally spying on one another's private citizens and sharing the collected information with each other. &#91; 11 &#93; &#91; 93 &#93; Shami Chakrabarti , director of the advocacy group Liberty , claimed that the FVEY alliance increases the ability of member states to ""subcontract their dirty work"" to each other. &#91; 94 &#93; FVEY countries maintain that all intelligence sharing is done legally, according to the domestic law of the respective nations. &#91; 95 &#93; &#91; 12 &#93; &#91; 96 &#93; As a result of Snowden's disclosures, the FVEY alliance has become the subject of a growing amount of controversy in parts of the world: In late 2013, Canadian federal judge Richard Mosley strongly rebuked the CSIS for outsourcing its surveillance of Canadians to overseas partner agencies. A 51-page court ruling asserts that the CSIS and other Canadian federal agencies have been illegally enlisting FVEY allies in global surveillance dragnets, while keeping domestic federal courts in the dark. &#91; 97 &#93; &#91; 98 &#93; &#91; 99 &#93; In 2014, New Zealand's Parliament asked the NZSIS and the GCSB if they had received any monetary contributions from members of the FVEY alliance. Neither agency responded to these inquiries, instead stating that they do not collect metadata on New Zealanders. David Cunliffe , leader of the Labour Party, asserted that the public is entitled to be informed of foreign funding if the disclosure does not compromise the agencies' operations. &#91; 100 &#93; In early 2014, the European Parliament 's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs released a report that confirmed that the intelligence agencies of New Zealand and Canada have cooperated with the NSA under the Five Eyes programme and may have been actively sharing the personal data of EU citizens. The EU report did not investigate if any international or domestic US laws were broken by the US and did not claim that any FVEY nation was illegally conducting intelligence collection on the EU. The NSA maintains that any intelligence collection done on the EU was in accordance with domestic US law and international law. &#91; 101 &#93; &#91; 102 &#93; In 2013, the British Parliament 's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) conducted an investigation and concluded that the GCHQ had broken no domestic British laws in its use of data gathered through the NSA's PRISM . According to the ISC report, The GCHQ provided documents which ""conformed with GCHQ's statutory duties"" and authority as established by the Intelligence Services Act 1994 . Requests made to the US corresponded with extant warrants for interception in accordance with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 . The ISC also questioned whether the UK's legal framework was sufficient. &#91; 103 &#93; As of April 2024, no court case has been brought against any US intelligence community member claiming that they went around US domestic law by soliciting foreign countries to spy on US citizens and give that intelligence to the US. This may change as attention is paid to the anticipated public releases regarding Operation Lobos 1 , Operation Trojan Shield , and Project Habitance . These operations received information from foreign governments for spying on US citizens. The FBI did initiate Operation Trojan Shield, which was illegal in the US and so relied on the Australian government. Seventeen U.S. citizens have been charged in U.S. federal court between 2021 and 2024, but none of the cases as of April 2024 had proceeded past the initial pretrial stages. &#91; clarification needed &#93; &#91; citation needed &#93; Other international cooperatives [ edit ] Beginning with its founding by the United States and United Kingdom in 1946, the alliance expanded twice, inducting Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand in 1956, establishing the Five Eyes as it is today. Additionally, there are nations termed ""Third Party Partners"" that share their intelligence with the Five Eyes despite not being formal members. While the Five Eyes is rooted in a particular agreement with specific operations among the five nations, similar sharing agreements have been set up independently and for specific purposes; for example, according to Edward Snowden, the NSA has a ""massive body"" called the Foreign Affairs Directorate dedicated to partnering with foreign countries beyond the alliance. &#91; 104 &#93; &#91; 105 &#93; &#91; 106 &#93; Six Eyes (proposed) – Israel, Singapore, South Korea, Japan [ edit ] Several countries have been prospective members of the Five Eyes including Israel, &#91; 107 &#93; South Korea and Japan, that have collaborated with FVEY. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked documents from the NSA that showed Singapore, one of the world's biggest digital telecommunications hubs, is a key “third party” working with the “Five Eyes” intelligence partners, &#91; 108 &#93; and continue to collaborate intensively with the alliance, though Singapore, Israel, South Korea and Japan are formally non-members. &#91; 109 &#93; &#91; 110 &#93; According to French news magazine L'Obs , in 2009, the United States propositioned France to join the treaty and form a subsequent ""Six Eyes"" alliance. The French President at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy , requested that France have the same status as the other members, including the signing of a ""no-spy agreement"". This proposal was approved by the director of the NSA, but rejected by the director of the CIA and by President Barack Obama , resulting in a refusal from France. &#91; 111 &#93; New York magazine reported in 2013 that Germany was interested in joining the Five Eyes alliance. &#91; 112 &#93; &#91; 113 &#93; At the time, several members of the United States Congress, including Tim Ryan and Charles Dent , were pushing for Germany's entry to the Five Eyes alliance. &#91; 114 &#93; Five Eyes Plus [ edit ] As of 2018 through an initiative sometimes termed ""Five Eyes Plus 3"", Five Eyes has agreements with France, Germany, and Japan to introduce an information-sharing framework to counter China and Russia. &#91; 115 &#93; &#91; 116 &#93; Five Eyes plus France, Japan and South Korea share information about North Korea's military activities, including ballistic missiles, in an arrangement sometimes dubbed ""Five Eyes Plus"". &#91; 117 &#93; Nine Eyes [ edit ] A map of the Nine Eyes countries The Nine Eyes is a different group that consists of the Five Eyes members as well as Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Norway. &#91; 105 &#93; &#91; 106 &#93; Fourteen Eyes [ edit ] A map of the Fourteen Eyes countries According to a document leaked by Edward Snowden, there is another working agreement among 14 nations officially known as ""SIGINT Seniors Europe"", or "" SSEUR "". &#91; 118 &#93; This ""14 Eyes"" group consists of the Nine Eyes members plus Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. &#91; 105 &#93; &#91; 106 &#93; Further intelligence sharing collaborations [ edit ] As Privacy International explains, there are a number of issue-specific intelligence agreements that include some or all of the above nations and numerous others, such as: &#91; 119 &#93; &#91; 120 &#93; An area-specific sharing agreement among 41 nations including the 14 Eyes and the international coalition in Afghanistan . A ""focused cooperation"" on computer network exploitation between the Five Eyes nations and Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. The Club de Berne with 17, primarily European members. The Counterterrorist Group , a wider membership than the 17 European states that make up the Club of Berne, including the United States. Maximator , an intelligence alliance between Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. &#91; 121 &#93; The NATO Special Committee made up of the heads of the security services of NATO 's 32 member countries. &#91; citation needed &#93; See also [ edit ] United States portal United Kingdom portal Canada portal Australia portal New Zealand portal Politics portal ABCANZ Armies Air and Space Interoperability Council (air forces) Allied technological cooperation during World War II Anglosphere ANZUS — Trilateral security pact between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States AUKUS — Trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States AUSCANNZUKUS (navies) Border Five CANZUK Combined Communications-Electronics Board (communication-electronics) Five Country Conference (immigration) Five Nations Passport Group Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) — Strategic dialogue among Australia, India, Japan and US The Technical Cooperation Program (technology and science) Tizard Mission International relations [ edit ] Australia–Canada relations Australia–New Zealand relations Australia–United Kingdom relations Australia–United States relations Canada–New Zealand relations Canada–United Kingdom relations Canada–United States relations New Zealand–United Kingdom relations New Zealand–United States relations United Kingdom–United States relations References [ edit ] ^ ""Five Eyes Intelligence Oversight and Review Council (FIORC)"" . www.dni.gov .

Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c),MEMORANDUM,11/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/ensuring-the-enforcement-of-federal-rule-of-civil-procedure-65c/,"Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) The White House March 11, 2025 MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES Subject: Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) In recent weeks, activist organizations fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and sometimes even Government grants have obtained sweeping injunctions far beyond the scope of relief contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, functionally inserting themselves into the executive policy making process and therefore undermining the democratic process. This anti-democratic takeover is orchestrated by forum-shopping organizations that repeatedly bring meritless suits, used for fundraising and political grandstanding, without any repercussions when they fail. &nbsp;Taxpayers are forced not only to cover the costs of their antics when funding and hiring decisions are enjoined, but must needlessly wait for Government policies they voted for.&nbsp; Moreover, this situation results in the Department of Justice, the Nation&#8217;s chief law enforcement agency, dedicating substantial resources to fighting frivolous suits instead of defending public safety. The effective administration of justice in the Federal courts depends on mechanisms that deter frivolous litigation, protect parties from unwarranted costs, and streamline judicial processes.&nbsp; One key mechanism is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) (Rule 65(c)), which mandates that a party seeking a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order (injunction) provide security in an amount that the court considers proper to cover potential costs and damages to the enjoined or restrained party if the injunction is wrongly issued.&nbsp; Consistent enforcement of this rule is critical to ensuring that taxpayers do not foot the bill for costs or damages caused by wrongly issued preliminary relief by activist judges and to achieving the effective administration of justice. Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to demand that parties seeking injunctions against the Federal Government must cover the costs and damages incurred if the Government is ultimately found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.&nbsp; Federal courts should hold litigants accountable for their misrepresentations and ill-granted injunctions. Consistent with applicable law, the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies), in consultation with the Attorney General, are directed to ensure that their respective agencies properly request under Rule 65(c) that Federal district courts require plaintiffs to post security equal to the Federal Government&#8217;s potential costs and damages from a wrongly issued injunction. &nbsp;The scope of this directive covers all lawsuits filed against the Federal Government seeking an injunction where agencies can show expected monetary damages or costs from the requested preliminary relief, unless extraordinary circumstances justify an exception. In requests for security under Rule 65(c), agencies shall include, among other things, that: (a)&nbsp; Rule 65(c) mandates the court to require, in all applicable cases, that a movant for an injunction post security in an amount that the court considers proper to cover potential costs and damages to the enjoined or restrained party; (b)&nbsp; the security amount the agency is requesting is based on a reasoned assessment of the potential harm to the enjoined or restrained party; and (c)&nbsp; failure of the party that moved for preliminary relief to comply with Rule 65(c) results in denial or dissolution of the requested injunctive relief. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

ADDRESSING RISKS FROM PAUL WEISS,EXECUTIVE ORDER,14/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-paul-weiss/,"Addressing Risks from Paul Weiss &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions ADDRESSING RISKS FROM PAUL WEISS The White House March 14, 2025 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Background . Global law firms have for years played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles. Many have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections. Additionally, they have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono , or ostensibly &#8220;for the public good&#8221; &#8212; potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all. My Administration will no longer support taxpayer funds sponsoring such harm. My Administration has already taken action to address some of the significant risks and egregious conduct associated with law firms, and I have determined that similar action is necessary to end Government sponsorship of harmful activity by an additional law firm: Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss). In 2021, a Paul Weiss partner and former leading prosecutor in the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller brought a pro bono suit against individuals alleged to have participated in the events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, on behalf of the District of Columbia Attorney General. In 2022, Paul Weiss hired unethical attorney Mark Pomerantz, who had previously left Paul Weiss to join the Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s office solely to manufacture a prosecution against me and who, according to his co-workers, unethically led witnesses in ways designed to implicate me. After being unable to convince even Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that a fraud case was feasible, Pomerantz engaged in a media campaign to gin up support for this unwarranted prosecution. Additionally, Paul Weiss discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. Paul Weiss, along with nearly every other large, influential, or industry leading law firm, makes decisions around &#8220;targets&#8221; based on race and sex. My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimination perpetrated in the name of &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation&#8217;s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec . 2 . Security Clearance Review . (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Paul Weiss and Mark Pomerantz, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Paul Weiss. The heads of all agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec . 3 . Contracting . (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Paul Weiss and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with Paul Weiss or with entities that disclose doing business with Paul Weiss under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Paul Weiss has been hired to perform any service; (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Paul Weiss or with entities that do business with Paul Weiss effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec . 4 . Racial Discrimination . Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec . 5 . Personnel .

Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua,PROCLAMATION,15/03/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/,"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J. Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Presidential Actions Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua The White House March 15, 2025 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION Tren de Aragua (TdA) is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States. TdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking. TdA has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime&#8217;s goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States. TdA is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the Maduro regime, including its military and law enforcement apparatus. TdA grew significantly while Tareck El Aissami served as governor of Aragua between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, El Aissami was appointed as Vice President of Venezuela. Soon thereafter, the United States Department of the Treasury designated El Aissami as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, 21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. El Aissami is currently a United States fugitive facing charges arising from his violations of United States sanctions triggered by his Department of the Treasury designation. Like El Aissami, Nicolas Maduro, who claims to act as Venezuela&#8217;s President and asserts control over the security forces and other authorities in Venezuela, also maintains close ties to regime-sponsored narco-terrorists. Maduro leads the regime-sponsored enterprise Cártel de los Soles, which coordinates with and relies on TdA and other organizations to carry out its objective of using illegal narcotics as a weapon to &#8220;flood&#8221; the United States. In 2020, Maduro and other regime members were charged with narcoterrorism and other crimes in connection with this plot against America. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. Indeed, in December 2024, INTERPOL Washington confirmed: &#8220;Tren de Aragua has emerged as a significant threat to the United States as it infiltrates migration flows from Venezuela.&#8221; Evidence irrefutably demonstrates that TdA has invaded the United States and continues to invade, attempt to invade, and threaten to invade the country; perpetrated irregular warfare within the country; and used drug trafficking as a weapon against our citizens. Based upon a review of TdA&#8217;s activities, and in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, on February 20, 2025, acting pursuant to the authority in 8 U.S.C. 1189, the Secretary of State designated TdA as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. As President of the United States and Commander in Chief, it is my solemn duty to protect the American people from the devastating effects of this invasion. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., hereby proclaim and direct as follows: Section 1 . I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. I make these findings using the full extent of my authority to conduct the Nation&#8217;s foreign affairs under the Constitution. Based on these findings, and by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 50 U.S.C. 21, I proclaim that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are, by virtue of their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual hostility against the United States and are therefore ineligible for the benefits of 50 U.S.C. 22. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are a danger to the public peace or safety of the United States. Sec . 2 . I direct the Attorney General, within 60 days of the date of this proclamation, to prepare and publish a letter under her signature declaring the policy described in section 1 of this proclamation as the policy of the United States and attaching this proclamation. I direct the Attorney General to transmit this letter to the Chief Justice of the United States, the chief judge of every circuit court of appeals, the chief judge of every district and territorial court of the United States, each Governor of a State and territory of the United States, and the highest-ranking judicial officer of each State and territory of the United States. Sec . 3 . I direct that all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and removal, and further that they shall not be permitted residence in the United States. Sec . 4 . Pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Secretary of Homeland Security retains discretion to apprehend and remove any Alien Enemy under any separate authority. Sec . 5 . All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall collaborate with law enforcement officials of the United States and with appropriate State, local, and tribal officials, to use all lawful means to apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. Sec . 6 . Pursuant to my authority under 50 U.S.C. 21 to direct the conduct to be observed on the part of the United States toward the Alien Enemies subject to this proclamation, to direct the manner and degree of the restraint to which such Alien Enemies shall be subject and in what cases, to provide for the removal of such Alien Enemies, and to establish any other regulations which are found necessary &#8220;in the premises and for the public safety,&#8221; I hereby direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to execute all the regulations hereinafter contained regarding the Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are further directed to cause the apprehension, detention, and removal of all members of TdA who otherwise qualify as Alien Enemies under section 1 of this proclamation. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are authorized to take all necessary actions under the Alien Enemies Act to effectuate this proclamation, consistent with applicable law. In doing so, and for such purpose, they are authorized to utilize agents, agencies, and officers of the United States Government and of the several States, territories, dependencies, and municipalities thereof and of the District of Columbia. All such agents, agencies, and officers are hereby granted full authority for all acts done by them in the execution of such regulations when acting by direction of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as the case may be. Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., I hereby declare and establish the following regulations which I find necessary &#8220;in the premises and for the public safety&#8221;: (a) No Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation shall enter, attempt to enter, or be found within any territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Any such Alien Enemy who enters, attempts to enter, or is found within such territory shall be immediately apprehended and detained until removed from the United States. All such Alien Enemies, wherever found within any territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are subject to summary apprehension. (b) Alien Enemies apprehended pursuant to this proclamation shall be subject to detention until removed from the United States in such place of detention as may be directed by the officers responsible for the execution of these regulations. (c) Alien Enemies shall be subject to removal to any such location as may be directed by the officers responsible for the execution of these regulations consistent with applicable law. (d) All property in the possession of, or traceable to, an Alien Enemy, which is used, intended to be used, or is commonly used to perpetrate the hostile activity and irregular warfare of TdA, along with evidence of such hostile activity and irregular warfare, shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture. The Attorney General is further granted authority, pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act and 3 U.S.C. 301, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to issue any guidance necessary to effectuate the prompt apprehension, detention, and removal of all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. Any such guidance shall be effective immediately upon issuance by the Attorney General. This proclamation and the directives and regulations prescribed herein shall extend and apply to all land and water, continental or insular, in any way within the jurisdiction of the United States. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq .), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Purpose . Many shippers based in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices. These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption under section 321(a)(2)(C) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C)). As noted in Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), as amended by Executive Order 14228 of March 3, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), these exports play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the United States. In Executive Order 14200 of February 5, 2025 (Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), I suspended the elimination of duty-free de minimis treatment on articles described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195. The Secretary of Commerce has notified me that adequate systems are now in place to process and collect tariff revenue for covered goods from the PRC otherwise eligible for duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C). Accordingly, duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) shall no longer be available for products of the PRC (which include products of Hong Kong) described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, including international postal packages sent to the United States through the international postal network from the PRC or Hong Kong, that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025. Additional duties for such imported merchandise shall be collected at the rates described in this order. Sec . 2 . Assessment of Duties on Low-Value Products of the PRC . (a) Other than articles sent to the United States through the international postal network (for which a duty is separately provided as described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section), all shipments of articles described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, that are products of the PRC or Hong Kong; that are sent to the United States; that are valued at or under 800 dollars and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption authorized in 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C); and that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, shall be entered by a party qualified to make entry under another appropriate entry type in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security, with all applicable duties, including those imposed by section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228, and paid in accordance with the applicable entry and payment procedures. Executive departments and agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, through CBP, shall take all necessary actions to effectuate the objectives of this order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal Register . The United States International Trade Commission shall continue to act ministerially by modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as needed, to reflect the actions set out in this order. (b) Imposition of Duty. (i) All postal items containing goods described in section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195 and sent to the United States through the international postal network from the PRC or Hong Kong and transported by carriers that are valued at or under 800 dollars and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption authorized in 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) shall be subject to the duties described in subsection (c) of this section. In order to address the threat of the PRC&#8217;s failure to act to blunt the sustained influx of synthetic opioids into the United States, while allowing for the orderly flow of legitimate international mail, the duties imposed in subsection (c) of this section, except as required by applicable law, are imposed in lieu of any other duties that the shipments would otherwise be subject to, including the 20 percent ad valorem duty established in Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228; most-favored nation rates embodied in the HTSUS; and duties imposed pursuant to section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. (ii) CBP is authorized to require the carrier transporting the international postal package into the United States to remit payment of the duty described in subsection (c) of this section to CBP monthly or on such other periodic time frame as CBP determines appropriate, and CBP may issue regulations and guidance as necessary or appropriate to implement and enforce this requirement. (iii) All carriers that transport international postal packages from the PRC or Hong Kong to the United States as part of or on behalf of the international postal network must report to CBP the total number of postal items containing goods and, if electing the duty rate specified in subsection (c)(i) of this section, the value of each postal item containing goods, transported per conveyance, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by CBP. CBP may require submission of documentation and information from the carrier to verify the total number and value of individual postal items containing goods to be electronically transmitted through the ACE. (c) Duty Rates. Transportation carriers delivering shipments to the United States from the PRC or Hong Kong sent through the international postal network must collect and remit duties to CBP under the approach outlined in either subsection (c)(i) or subsection (c)(ii) of this section. Transportation carriers must apply the same duty collection methodology to all shipments; however, transportation carriers may change their collection methodology once a month or on such other periodic timeframe as CBP determines appropriate, upon providing 24-hour notice to CBP. (i) Ad Valorem Duty. 30 percent of the value of the postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025. (ii) Specific Duty. 25 dollars per postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, and before 12:01 am eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, and 50 dollars per postal item containing goods for merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025. (d) Bond Requirement. Any carrier that transports international postal items containing goods from the PRC or Hong Kong to the United States, by any mode of transportation, must have an international carrier bond to ensure payment of the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. CBP is authorized to ensure that the international carrier bonds required by this subsection are sufficient to account for the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. (e) Discretion to Require Formal Entry. CBP may require formal entry, in accordance with existing regulations, for any international postal package that may otherwise be subject to the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. An international postal package for which CBP requires formal entry will not be subject to the duty described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and instead will be subject to all applicable duties, taxes, and fees in accordance with all applicable laws. Sec . 3 . Implementation of Duty . The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to take all necessary actions to implement this order. Consistent with section 4 of Executive Order 14195, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec . 4 . Homeland Security Authorities . Nothing in this order limits the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to use any available legal authorities granted to ensure compliance with the provisions of this order. Sec . 5 . Monitoring . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall submit a report to the President regarding the impact of this order on American industries, consumers, and supply chains and making recommendations for further action as he deems necessary, including a recommendation on whether extending de minimis ineligibility to packages from Macau is necessary to prevent circumvention of this order. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Their proud perseverance in overcoming tremendous hurdles is emblematic of the strength and grit that makes America great. The First Lady and I extend our heartfelt appreciation to the families, friends, and communities aiding Americans with ASD as we empower every citizen to take part in and shape our new golden age. Autism now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States, a staggering increase from the 1980s, when the disorder was found in only 1 to 4 out of every 10,000 individuals. I created the Make America Healthy Again Commission to investigate and address the root causes of our escalating health crisis, with a focus on childhood disorders like autism. As part of this effort, my Administration is prioritizing gold-standard research and increasing transparency to gain new insights to aid those with ASD. Under my leadership, our great Nation will be stronger than ever before, with opportunities for all Americans to thrive and prosper. Despite challenges, Americans with ASD have made, and will continue to make outstanding contributions for our country and the world. Early detection is crucial to improving the quality of life of those with ASD, as timely intervention can significantly improve long-term outcomes. Identifying signs of autism at the onset allows parents and healthcare providers to implement therapies and support strategies which can enhance communication and social skills. Loving parents want the best for their children in educational environments and so do we. By supporting our children and their families, we can help them in overcoming challenges during childhood, the most crucial stage of development. Together, on World Autism Awareness Day, we declare our unending support and wholehearted respect for Americans living with autism. My Administration will empower them to reach their full potential and realize their American Dream. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2025, as World Autism Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by individuals with autism, and find ways to support those with autism and their families. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.

Purpose . In order to secure America&#8217;s economic prosperity and national security, lower the cost of living, and provide for increases in electrical demand from emerging technologies, we must increase domestic energy production, including coal. Coal is abundant and cost effective, and can be used in any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed hundreds of thousands of Americans. America&#8217;s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness. Our Nation&#8217;s beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers. We must encourage and support our Nation&#8217;s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic security. It is a national priority to support the domestic coal industry by removing Federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that Federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or coal-fired electricity generation. Sec . 3 . Strengthening Our National Energy Security . The Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) shall designate coal as a &#8220;mineral&#8221; as defined in section 2 of Executive Order 14241 of March 20, 2025 (Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production), thereby entitling coal to all the benefits of a &#8220;mineral&#8221; under that order. Further, Executive Order 14241 is hereby amended by deleting the reference to &#8220;4332(d)(1)(B)&#8221; in section 6(d) of that order and replacing it with a reference to &#8220;4532(d)(1)(B)&#8221;.

While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed &#8220;resistance&#8221; within the Federal Government that &#8220;vowed&#8221; to undermine and render ineffective a sitting President. He illegally published classified conversations to sell his book under the pseudonym &#8220;Anonymous,&#8221; which is full of falsehoods and fabricated stories. In so doing, Taylor abandoned his sacred oath and commitment to public service by disclosing sensitive information obtained through unauthorized methods and betrayed the confidence of those with whom he served. Where a Government employee improperly discloses sensitive information for the purposes of personal enrichment and undermining our foreign policy, national security, and Government effectiveness –- all ultimately designed to sow chaos and distrust in Government &#8212; this conduct could properly be characterized as treasonous and as possibly violating the Espionage Act, and therefore makes such employee ineligible for access to national secrets. In his former position, Taylor relied upon various colleagues to facilitate his unethical laundering and release of sensitive Government data to advance his false narratives. It is therefore against America&#8217;s interests to allow those associated with Taylor to access our Nation&#8217;s secrets. Accordingly, I direct the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant executive department and agency (agency) heads to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by Miles Taylor, in addition to individuals at entities associated with Taylor, including the University of Pennsylvania, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with any other relevant agency heads, to take all appropriate action to review Miles Taylor&#8217;s activities as a Government employee. This review should identify any instances where his conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for Federal employees, and where his conduct appears to have involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information. Upon completing this review, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to protect America&#8217;s interests. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Yet in recent years, elitist leaders in Government have unlawfully censored speech and weaponized their undeserved influence to silence perceived political opponents and advance their preferred, and often erroneous, narrative about significant matters of public debate. These disgraceful actions have taken the form of coercive threats against the private sector &#8212; including major social media platforms &#8212; to suppress conservative or dissenting voices and distort public opinion. Much of this censorship took place during a Presidential election with the apparent purpose of undermining the free exchange of ideas and debate. Christopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority. Krebs&#8217; misconduct involved the censorship of disfavored speech implicating the 2020 election and COVID-19 pandemic. CISA, under Krebs&#8217; leadership, suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting supposed disinformation, and recruited and coerced major social media platforms to further its partisan mission. CISA covertly worked to blind the American public to the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop. Krebs, through CISA, promoted the censorship of election information, including known risks associated with certain voting practices. Similarly, Krebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines. Krebs skewed the bona fide debate about COVID-19 by attempting to discredit widely shared views that ran contrary to CISA&#8217;s favored perspective. Abusive conduct of this sort both violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself. Those who engage in or support such conduct must not have continued access to our Nation&#8217;s secrets. Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive department and agencies (agencies) to immediately take steps consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearance held by Christopher Krebs. I further direct the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant agencies to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. I further direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with any other agency head, to take all appropriate action to review Krebs&#8217; activities as a Government employee, including his leadership of CISA. This review should identify any instances where Krebs&#8217; conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for Federal employees, involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information, or contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149 of January 20, 2025 (Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship). As part of that review, I direct a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA&#8217;s activities over the last 6 years, focusing specifically on any instances where CISA&#8217;s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149. Upon completing these reviews, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a joint report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of Executive Order 14149. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . As Chief Executive and Commander in Chief, I am committed to ensuring that the United States military possesses the most lethal warfighting capabilities in the world. America&#8217;s defense industrial base is central to this effort. Similarly, the defense acquisition workforce is a national strategic asset that will be decisive in any conflict, where the factory floor can be just as significant as the battlefield. Unfortunately, after years of misplaced priorities and poor management, our defense acquisition system does not provide the speed and flexibility our Armed Forces need to have decisive advantages in the future. In order to strengthen our military edge, America must deliver state‐of‐the‐art capabilities at speed and scale through a comprehensive overhaul of this system. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States Government to accelerate defense procurement and revitalize the defense industrial base to restore peace through strength. To achieve this, the United States will rapidly reform our antiquated defense acquisition processes with an emphasis on speed, flexibility, and execution. We will also modernize the duties and composition of the defense acquisition workforce, as well as incentivize and reward risk-taking and innovation from these personnel. Sec . 3 . Acquisition Process Reform . Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the President a plan to reform the Department of Defense&#8217;s acquisition processes that, to the maximum extent possible, incorporates the following: (a) Utilization of existing authorities to expedite acquisitions throughout the Department of Defense, including a first preference for commercial solutions and a general preference for Other Transactions Authority, application of Rapid Capabilities Office policies, or any other authorities or pathways to promote streamlined acquisitions under the Adaptative Acquisition Framework. Starting upon issuance of this order, and during the formation of the plan, the Secretary of Defense shall prioritize use of these authorities in all pending Department of Defense contracting actions and require their application, where appropriate and consistent with applicable law, for all Department of Defense contracting actions pursued while the plan directed by this section is under consideration. (b) A detailed process review of each functional support role within the acquisition workforce to eliminate unnecessary tasks, reduce duplicative approvals, and centralize decision-making. These reviews should also include evaluations of program managers, contracting officers, engineering authorities, financial managers, cost estimators, and logisticians. (c) A detailed process by which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Service Acquisition Executives, and Component Acquisition Executives can effectively manage risk for all acquisition programs through a formal steering board known as a Configuration Steering Board. Sec . 4 . Internal Regulations Review . The Secretary of Defense shall oversee the review of and, as appropriate, propose revisions to relevant Department of Defense instructions, implementation guides, manuals, and regulations relating to acquisition to: (a) Eliminate or revise any unnecessary supplemental regulations or any other internal guidance, such as relevant parts of the Financial Management Regulation and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. (b) Promote expedited and streamlined acquisitions. Where new supplemental regulations or internal guidance is proposed, the Secretary of Defense shall apply the ten-for-one rule as described in Executive Order 14192 of January 31, 2025 (Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation). Sec . 5 . Acquisition Workforce Reform . Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, and Component Acquisition Executives, shall develop and submit to the President a plan for consideration to reform, right-size, and train the acquisition workforce that includes the following components: (a) The restructuring of performance evaluation metrics for acquisition workforce members to include the ability to demonstrate and apply a first consideration of commercial solutions, adaptive acquisition pathways through the Adaptive Acquisition Framework, and iterative requirements based on the perspective of the end user.

(c) The establishment of field training teams by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, led by senior acquisition executives or managers with expertise in innovative acquisition authorities and commercial solutions, and modeled after field training teams authorized by section 832 of Public Law 118-159 (10 U.S.C. 1749). These teams should provide hands-on guidance, deliver templates and case studies of successful approaches for implementing innovative acquisition authorities, and should assist integrated functional program teams in completing acquisition and sustainment tasks. (d) The development and implementation of policies, procedures, and tools to incentivize acquisition officials to, in good faith, utilize innovative acquisition authorities and take measured and calculated risks. Sec . 6 . Major Defense Acquisition Program Review . (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, and Component Acquisition Executives, shall complete a comprehensive review of all major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs), as defined in section 4201 of title 10, United States Code, to determine if any such programs are inconsistent with the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order. As part of the review of all MDAPs: (i) any program more than 15 percent behind schedule based on the current Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), 15 percent over cost based on the current APB, unable to meet any key performance parameters, or unaligned with the Secretary of Defense&#8217;s mission priorities, will be considered for potential cancellation.

Purpose . The commercial shipbuilding capacity and maritime workforce of the United States has been weakened by decades of Government neglect, leading to the decline of a once strong industrial base while simultaneously empowering our adversaries and eroding United States national security. Both our allies and our strategic competitors produce ships for a fraction of the cost needed in the United States. Recent data shows that the United States constructs less than one percent of commercial ships globally, while the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) is responsible for producing approximately half. Rectifying these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes securing consistent, predictable, and durable Federal funding, making United States-flagged and built vessels commercially competitive in international commerce, rebuilding America&#8217;s maritime manufacturing capabilities (the Maritime Industrial Base), and expanding and strengthening the recruitment, training, and retention of the relevant workforce. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity. Sec . 3 . Maritime Action Plan . (a) Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), and the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) the APNSA deems appropriate, shall submit a Maritime Action Plan (MAP) to the President, through the APNSA and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) to achieve the policy set forth in this order. (b) The OMB Director, in coordination with the APNSA, shall be responsible for all legislative, regulatory, and fiscal assessments related to the MAP. (c) The MAP shall, to the extent permissible and consistent with applicable law, including the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 8301–8305), reflect actions taken pursuant to sections 4 through 21 of this order. Sec . 4 . Ensure the Security and Resilience of the Maritime Industrial Base . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall provide to the APNSA and the OMB Director for inclusion in the MAP an assessment of options both for the use of available authorities and resources, such as Defense Production Act Title III authorities, and for the use of private capital to the maximum extent possible to invest in and expand the Maritime Industrial Base including, but not limited to, investment and expansion of commercial and defense shipbuilding capabilities, component supply chains, ship repair and marine transportation capabilities, port infrastructure, and the adjacent workforce. The Secretary of Defense shall pursue using the Office of Strategic Capital loan program to improve the shipbuilding industrial base. As part of their assessment, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall: (a) identify key maritime components in the supply chain that are essential for rebuilding and expanding the Maritime Industrial Base and that should be prioritized for investment; (b) ensure that their recommendations of public and private investments are made according to a clear metric, derived in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, of return on invested capital for the United States taxpayer and to the economic and national security of the United States; and (c) ensure that their recommendations take into consideration the projected increases to commercial and defense capabilities, the projected growth in economic activity, and the projected benefits for taxpayers and the workforce. Sec . 5 . Actions in the Investigation of the PRC&#8217;s Unfair Targeting of Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors . (a) With respect to the actions, if any, that the USTR determines to take consistent with the USTR&#8217;s notice of public hearing entitled Proposed Action in Section 301 Investigation of the PRC&#8217;s Targeting of the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance, 90 Fed . Reg . 10843 (February 27, 2025), the USTR shall: (i) coordinate with appropriate agencies to collect additional information, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, in support of administering such actions; and (ii) coordinate with the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate steps to enforce any restriction, fee, penalty, or duty imposed pursuant to such actions.

Consistent with these priorities and with my commitment to restore fidelity to the Constitution, on February 19, 2025, I&nbsp;issued Executive Order 14219 (Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221; Deregulatory Initiative ) .&nbsp; It directed the heads of all executive departments and agencies to identify certain categories of unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations within 60 days and begin plans to repeal them.&nbsp; This review-and-repeal effort shall prioritize, in particular, evaluating each existing regulation&#8217;s lawfulness under the following United&nbsp;States Supreme Court decisions:&nbsp; Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , 603 U.S. 369 (2024); West Virginia v. EPA , 597 U.S. 697 (2022); SEC v. Jarkesy , 603 U.S. 109 (2024); Michigan v. EPA , 576 U.S. 743 (2015); Sackett v. EPA , 598 U.S. 651 (2023); Ohio v. EPA , 603 U.S. 279 (2024); Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid , 594 U.S. 139 (2021); Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard , 600 U.S. 181 (2023); Carson v. Makin , 596 U.S. 767 (2022); and Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 592 U.S. 14 (2020). In effectuating repeals of facially unlawful regulations, agency heads shall finalize rules without notice and comment, where doing so is consistent with the &#8220;good cause&#8221; exception in the Administrative Procedure Act. That exception allows agencies to dispense with notice-and-comment rulemaking when that process would be &#8220;impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.&#8221; Retaining and enforcing facially unlawful regulations is clearly contrary to the public interest. Furthermore, notice-and-comment proceedings are &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; where repeal is required as a matter of law to ensure consistency with a ruling of the United States Supreme Court. Agencies thus have ample cause and the legal authority to immediately repeal unlawful regulations. Accordingly, I hereby direct: Following the 60-day review period ordered in Executive Order 14219 to identify unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations, agencies shall immediately take steps to effectuate the repeal of any regulation, or the portion of any regulation, that clearly exceeds the agency&#8217;s statutory authority or is otherwise unlawful. Agencies should give priority to the regulations in conflict with the United States Supreme Court decisions listed earlier in this memorandum. The repeal of each unlawful regulation shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons that the &#8220;good cause&#8221; exception applies. Within 30 days of the conclusion of the review period directed in Executive Order 14219 to identify unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations, agencies shall submit to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs a one-page summary of each regulation that was initially identified as falling within one of the categories specified in section 2(a) of that Executive Order, but which has not been targeted for repeal, explaining the basis for the decision not to repeal that regulation.

Our southern border is under attack from a variety of threats. The complexity of the current situation requires that our military take a more direct role in securing our southern border than in the recent past. Through Executive Order 14167 of January 20, 2025 (Clarifying the Military&#8217;s Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States), I assigned the Armed Forces of the United States the military missions of repelling the invasion and sealing the United States southern border from unlawful entry to maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States. This memorandum provides additional guidance on securing the southern border to the heads of certain executive departments. Section 1 . Policy . (a) to accomplish the military missions described in Executive Order 14167, and to ensure the safety and security of the military and other Federal personnel in areas of military operations within Federal lands along the southern border, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate actions: (i) to provide for the use and jurisdiction by the Department of Defense over such Federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation and excluding Federal Indian Reservations, that are reasonably necessary to enable military activities directed in this memorandum, including border-barrier construction and emplacement of detection and monitoring equipment; and (ii) to provide for transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over such Federal lands in accordance with applicable law to enable military activities directed in this memorandum to occur on a military installation under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense and for the designation of such Federal lands as National Defense Areas by the Secretary of Defense. (b) The Secretary of the Interior shall allow the Secretary of Defense to use those portions of the Roosevelt Reservation not yet transferred or withdrawn under this memorandum. In accordance with Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States), 43 U.S.C. 155 is hereby invoked and the Secretary of the Interior may make withdrawals, reservations, and restrictions of public lands to provide for the utilization of public lands by the Department of Defense to address the emergency at the southern border, without regard to any limitation on withdrawals otherwise applicable under the terms of the Engle Act, 43 U.S.C. 155-158. (c) The Secretary of Defense may determine those military activities that are reasonably necessary and appropriate to accomplish the mission assigned in Executive Order 14167 and that are necessary to protect and maintain the security of military installations, consistent with section 2672 of title 10, United States Code, and the longstanding authority of a military installation commander to exclude persons from a military installation, as recognized in section 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797) and 18 U.S.C. 1382. (d) In carrying out activities under this memorandum, members of the Armed Forces will follow rules for the use of force prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. Sec . 2 . Phased Implementation . The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Homeland Security will initially implement this memorandum on a limited sector of Federal lands designated by the Secretary of Defense. Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Defense shall assess this initial phase. At any time, the Secretary of Defense may extend activities under this memorandum to additional Federal lands along the southern border in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority of the Secretary of Defense to authorize and request that State Governors order members of the National Guard under authority of title 32 of the United States Code to conduct Department of Defense activities, including as appropriate to support law enforcement activities under the responsibility of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, if requested by such official; (ii) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (iii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Our task is to build a movement strong enough to stop them Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor Sun 13 Apr 2025 07.00 EDT Last modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 10.54 EDT Share View image in fullscreen The movement for corporate city states cannot believe its good luck. For years, it has been pushing the extreme notion that wealthy, tax-averse people should up and start their own high-tech fiefdoms, whether new countries on artificial islands in international waters (“ seasteading ”) or pro-business “freedom cities” such as Próspera , a glorified gated community combined with a wild west med spa on a Honduran island. Yet despite backing from the heavy-hitter venture capitalists Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, their extreme libertarian dreams kept bogging down: it turns out most self-respecting rich people don’t actually want to live on floating oil rigs, even if it means lower taxes, and while Próspera might be nice for a holiday and some body “upgrades”, its extra-national status is currently being challenged in court . Now, all of a sudden, this once-fringe network of corporate secessionists finds itself knocking on open doors at the dead center of global power. The first sign that fortunes were shifting came in 2023, when a campaigning Donald Trump , seemingly out of nowhere, promised to hold a contest that would lead to the creation of 10 “freedom cities” on federal lands. The trial balloon barely registered at the time, lost in the daily deluge of outrageous claims. Since the new administration took office, however, would-be country starters have been on a lobbying blitz, determined to turn Trump’s pledge into reality. “The energy in DC is absolutely electric,” Trey Goff, the chief of staff of Próspera, recently enthused after a trip to Capitol Hill. Legislation paving the way for a bevy of corporate city-states should be complete by the end of the year, he claims. Inspired by a warped reading of the political philosopher Albert Hirschman, figures including Goff, Thiel and the investor and writer Balaji Srinivasan have been championing what they call “exit” – the principle that those with means have the right to walk away from the obligations of citizenship, especially taxes and burdensome regulation. Retooling and rebranding the old ambitions and privileges of empires, they dream of splintering governments and carving up the world into hyper-capitalist, democracy-free havens under the sole control of the supremely wealthy, protected by private mercenaries, serviced by AI robots and financed by cryptocurrencies. View image in fullscreen Peter Thiel in Tokyo in 2019. Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images One might assume that it is contradictory for Trump, elected on a flag-waving “America first” platform, to lend credence to this vision of sovereign territories ruled over by billionaire god-kings. And much has been made of the colorful flame wars between the Maga mouth-piece Steve Bannon, a proud nationalist and populist, and the Trump-allied billionaires he has attacked as “technofeudalists” who “don’t give a flying fuck about the human being” – let alone the nation state. And conflicts inside Trump’s awkward, jerry-rigged coalition certainly exist, most recently reaching a boiling point over tariffs. Still, the underlying visions might not be as incompatible as they first appear. The startup country contingent is clearly foreseeing a future marked by shocks, scarcity and collapse. Their high-tech private domains are essentially fortressed escape pods, designed for the select few to take advantage of every possible luxury and opportunity for human optimization, giving them and their children an edge in an increasingly barbarous future. To put it bluntly, the most powerful people in the world are preparing for the end of the world, an end they themselves are frenetically accelerating. That is not so far away from the more mass-market vision of fortressed nations that has gripped the hard right globally, from Italy to Israel, Australia to the United States: in a time of ceaseless peril, openly supremacist movements in these countries are positioning their relatively wealthy states as armed bunkers. These bunkers are brutal in their determination to expel and imprison unwanted humans (even if that requires indefinite confinement in extra-national penal colonies from Manus Island to Guantánamo Bay) and equally ruthless in their willingness to violently claim the land and resources (water, energy, critical minerals) they deem necessary to weather the coming shocks. Though it builds on enduring rightwing tendencies ... we simply have not faced such a powerful apocalyptic strain in government before Interestingly, at a time when previously secular Silicon Valley elites are suddenly finding Jesus, it is noteworthy that both of these visions – the priority-pass corporate state and the mass-market bunker nation – share a great deal in common with the Christian fundamentalist interpretation of the biblical Rapture, when the faithful will supposedly be lifted up to a golden city in heaven, while the damned are left to endure an apocalyptic final battle down here on earth. If we are to meet our critical moment in history, we need to reckon with the reality that we are not up against adversaries we have seen before. We are up against end times fascism. Reflecting on his childhood under Mussolini, the novelist and philosopher Umberto Eco observed in a celebrated essay that fascism typically has an “Armageddon complex” – a fixation on vanquishing enemies in a grand final battle. But European fascism of the 1930s and 1940s also had a horizon: a vision for a future golden age after the bloodbath that, for its in-group, would be peaceful, pastoral and purified. Not today. Alive to our era of genuine existential danger – from climate breakdown to nuclear war to sky-rocketing inequality and unregulated AI – but financially and ideologically committed to deepening those threats, contemporary far-right movements lack any credible vision for a hopeful future. The average voter is offered only remixes of a bygone past, alongside the sadistic pleasures of dominance over an ever-expanding assemblage of dehumanized others. And so we have the Trump administration’s dedication to releasing its steady stream of real and AI-generated propaganda designed solely for these pornographic purposes. Footage of shackled immigrants being loaded on to deportation flights, set to the sounds of clanking chains and locking cuffs, which the official White House X account labeled “ASMR”, a reference to audio designed to calm the nervous system. Or the same account sharing news of the detention of Mahmoud Khalil , a US permanent resident who was active in Columbia University’s pro-Palestinian encampment, with the gloating words: “SHALOM, MAHMOUD.” Or any number of homeland security secretary Kristi Noem’s sadism-chic photo ops (atop a horse at the US-Mexican border, in front of a crowded prison cell in El Salvador, slinging a machine gun while arresting immigrants in Arizona …).

Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP The governing ideology of the far right in our age of escalating disasters has become a monstrous, supremacist survivalism. It is terrifying in its wickedness, yes. But it also opens up powerful possibilities for resistance. To bet against the future on this scale – to bank on your bunker – is to betray, on the most basic level, our duties to one another, to the children we love, and to every other life form with whom we share a planetary home. This is a belief system that is genocidal at its core and treasonous to the wonder and beauty of this world. We are convinced that the more people understand the extent to which the right has succumbed to the Armageddon complex, the more they will be willing to fight back, realizing that absolutely everything is now on the line. Our opponents know full well that we are entering an age of emergency, but have responded by embracing lethal yet self-serving delusions. Having bought into various apartheid fantasies of bunkered safety, they are choosing to let the Earth burn. Our task is to build a wide and deep movement, as spiritual as it is political, strong enough to stop these unhinged traitors. A movement rooted in a steadfast commitment to one another, across our many differences and divides, and to this miraculous, singular planet. View image in fullscreen Not so long ago, it was primarily religious fundamentalists who greeted signs of apocalypse with gleeful excitement about the long-awaited Rapture. Trump has handed critical posts to people who subscribe to that fiery orthodoxy, including several Christian Zionists who see Israel’s use of annihilatory violence to expand its territorial footprint not as illegal atrocities but as felicitous evidence that the Holy Land is getting closer to the conditions under which the Messiah will return, and the faithful will get their celestial kingdom. Mike Huckabee, Trump’s newly confirmed ambassador to Israel, has strong ties to Christian Zionism, as does Pete Hegseth , his secretary of defense. Noem and Russell Vought, the Project 2025 architect who now leads the office of budget and management, are both staunch advocates for Christian nationalism. Even Thiel, who is gay and notorious for his party lifestyle, has been heard musing about the arrival of the antichrist of late (spoiler: he thinks it’s Greta Thunberg, more on that soon). But you don’t need to be a biblical literalist, or even religious, to be an end times fascist. Today, plenty of powerful secular people have embraced a vision of the future that follows a nearly identical script, one in which the world as we know it collapses under its weight and a chosen few survive and thrive in various kinds of arks, bunkers and gated “freedom cities”. In a 2019 paper titled Left Behind: Future Fetishists, Prepping and the Abandonment of Earth, the communication scholars Sarah T Roberts and Mél Hogan described the longing for a secular Rapture: “In the accelerationist imaginary, the future is not about harm reduction, limits or restoration; rather it is a politics driving toward an endgame.” View image in fullscreen Mike Huckabee touring Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem in 2008. Photograph: David Silverman/Getty Images Elon Musk , who dramatically grew his fortune alongside Thiel at PayPal, embodies this implosive ethos. This is a person who looks up at the wonders of the night sky and apparently sees only opportunities to fill that inky unknown with his own space junk. Though he burnished his reputation warning about the dangers of the climate crisis and AI, he and his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) henchmen now spend their days escalating those same risks (and many others) by slashing not only environmental regulations but entire regulatory agencies, with the apparent end goal of replacing federal workers with chatbots. Who needs a functioning nation state when outer space – now reportedly Musk’s singular obsession – beckons? For Musk, Mars has become a secular ark, which he claims is key to the survival of human civilization, perhaps via uploaded consciousnesses to an artificial general intelligence. Kim Stanley Robinson, the author of the sci-fi Mars Trilogy that appears to have partially inspired Musk, is blunt about the dangers of the billionaire’s fantasies about colonizing Mars . It is, he says , “just a moral hazard that creates the illusion we can wreck Earth and still be okay. It’s totally not true.” Much like religious end-timers who long to escape the corporeal realm, Musk’s drive for humanity to become “multiplanetary” is made possible by his inability to appreciate the multispecies splendor of our only home. Evidently uninterested in the vast bounty that surrounds him, or in ensuring Earth can continue buzzing with diversity, he instead deploys his vast fortune to bring about a future that would see a handful of people and robots eke out survival on two barren orbs (a radically depleted Earth and a terraformed Mars). Indeed, in a strange twist on the Old Testament tale, Musk and his fellow tech billionaires, having arrogated god-like powers to themselves, aren’t content to just build the arks. They appear to be doing their best to cause the flood. Today’s rightwing leaders and their rich allies are not just taking advantage of catastrophes, shock-doctrine and disaster-capitalism style, but simultaneously provoking and planning for them. What of the Maga base, though? Not all are sufficiently faithful to earnestly believe in the Rapture, and most certainly don’t have the cash to buy a spot in a “freedom city” let alone on a rocket ship. Fear not. End times fascism offers the promise of many more affordable arks and bunkers, these ones well within reach for lower-level foot soldiers. Listen to Steve Bannon’s daily podcast – which bills itself as Maga’s premier media outlet – and you will be barraged with a singular message: the world is going to hell, the infidels are breaching the barricades, and a final battle is coming. Be prepared. The prepper message becomes particularly pronounced when Bannon switches to hawking his advertisers’ products. Buy Birch Gold, Bannon tells his audience, because the over-leveraged US economy is going to crash and you can’t trust the banks. Stock up on ready-to-eat meals from My Patriot Supply . Sharpen your target practice using a laser-guided at-home system. The last thing you would want to do is depend on the government during a disaster, he reminds listeners (left unsaid: especially now that the Doge boys are selling off the government for parts). End times fascism is a darkly festive fatalism – a final refuge for those who find it easier to celebrate destruction than imagine living without supremacy Bannon doesn’t only urge his audience to make their own bunkers, of course. He also advances a vision of the United States as a bunker in its own right, one in which Ice agents stalk the streets, workplaces and campuses, disappearing those deemed enemies of US policy and interests. The bunkered nation lies at the heart of the Maga agenda, and of end times fascism. Inside its logic, the first job is to harden national borders and expunge all enemies, foreign and domestic. This ugly work is now well under way, with the Trump administration , enabled by the supreme court, having invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to Cecot, the now infamous mega-prison in El Salvador. The facility, which shaves prisoners heads and packs up to 100 people into a single cell, stacked with bare bunks, operates under the civil liberties-destroying “state of exception” first declared over three years ago by the country’s crypto-loving, Christian Zionist prime minister, Nayib Bukele. Bukele has offered to provide the same fee-for-service system for US citizens the administration would like to drop into a judicial black hole. “I love that,” Trump said recently, when asked about the proposal. No wonder: Cecot is the sick if logical corollary of the “freedom city” fantasy – a zone where everything is for sale and due process does not apply. We should expect much more of this sadism. In a chillingly candid statement, the acting Ice director, Todd Lyons, told the 2025 Border Security Expo that he wanted to see a more “business”-oriented approach to these deportations, “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings”. If policing the boundaries of the bunkered nation is end times fascism’s job one, equally important is job two: for the US government to lay claim to whatever resources its protected citizens might need to get through the tough times ahead. Maybe it’s Panama’s canal. Or Greenland’s fast-melting shipping routes. Or Ukraine’s critical minerals. Or Canada’s fresh water. We should think of this less as old-school imperialism than super-sized prepping, at the level of the national state. Gone are the old colonial fig leaves of spreading democracy or God’s word – when Trump covetously scans the globe, he is stockpiling for civilizational collapse. This bunker mentality also helps explain JD Vance’s controversial forays into Catholic theology. The vice-president, who owes his political career in no small part to the largess of the premier prepper Thiel, explained to Fox News that, according to the medieval Christian concept of ordo amoris (translated both as “order of love” and “order of charity”), love is not owed to those outside the bunker: “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” (Or not, as the Trump administration’s foreign policy would indicate.) In other words, we owe nothing to anyone outside our bunker. Though it builds on enduring rightwing tendencies – justifying hateful exclusions is hardly new under the ethno-nationalist sun – we simply have not faced such a powerful apocalyptic strain in government before. The “end of history” swagger of the post-cold war era is rapidly being supplanted by a conviction we are in the actual end of times. Doge may wrap itself in the banner of economic “efficiency”, and Musk’s underlings may evoke memories of the young, US-trained “Chicago Boys” who designed the economic shock therapy for Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorial regime, but this is not simply the old marriage of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. It’s a new, money-worshiping millenarian mashup that says we need to smash the bureaucracy and replace humans with chatbots in order to cut “waste, fraud and abuse” – and, also, because the bureaucracy is where the Trump-resisting demons hide. This is where the tech bros merge with the TheoBros , a real group of hyper-patriarchal Christian supremacists with ties to Hegseth and others in the Trump administration. View image in fullscreen Steve Bannon advances a vision of the United States as a bunker in its own right. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images As fascism always does, today’s Armageddon complex crosses class lines, bonding billionaires to the Maga base. Thanks to decades of deepening economic stresses, alongside ceaseless and skillful messaging pitting workers against one another, a great many people understandably feel unable to protect themselves from the disintegration that surrounds them (no matter how many months of ready-to-eat meals they buy). But there are emotional compensations on offer: you can cheer the end of affirmative action and DEI, glorify mass deportation, enjoy the denial of gender-affirming care to trans people, villainize educators and health workers who think they know better than you, and applaud the demise of economic and environmental regulations as a way to own the libs. End times fascism is a darkly festive fatalism – a final refuge for those who find it easier to celebrate destruction than imagine living without supremacy. It’s also a self-reinforcing downward spiral: Trump’s furious attacks on every structure designed to protect the public from diseases, dangerous foods and disasters – even to tell the public when disasters are headed their way – strengthen the case for prepperism at both the high and low ends, all while creating myriad new opportunities for privatization and profiteering by the oligarchs powering this rapid-fire unmaking of the social and regulatory state. View image in fullscreen At the dawn of Trump’s first term, the New Yorker investigated a phenomenon that it described as “doomsday prep for the super-rich”. Back then, it was already clear that in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, the more serious high-end survivalists were hedging against climate disruption and social collapse by buying space in custom-built underground bunkers and building escape homes on high ground in places like Hawaii (where Mark Zuckerberg has downplayed his 5,000 sq ft underground pad as a “little shelter”) and New Zealand (where Thiel purchased nearly 500 acres but found his plan to build a luxury survivalist compound rejected by local authorities in 2022 for being an eyesore). This millenarianism is bound up with a suite of other Silicon Valley intellectual fads, all premised on an end-times-inflected belief that our planet is headed towards a cataclysm and it’s time to make some hard choices about which parts of humanity can be saved. Transhumanism is one such ideology, encompassing everything from minor human-machine “enhancements” to the quest to upload human intelligence into a still illusory artificial general intelligence. There is also effective altruism and longtermism, both of which skip over redistributive approaches to helping those in need in the here and now in favor of a cost-benefit approach to doing the most good in the long term. Though they can appear benign at first glance, these ideas are shot through with dangerous racial, ableist and gender biases about which parts of humanity are worth enhancing and saving – and which could be sacrificed for the supposed good of the whole. They also share a marked lack of interest in urgently addressing the underlying drivers of collapse – a responsible and rational goal that a growing cohort of figures now actively shun. Instead of effective altruism the Mar-a-Lago regular Andreessen and others have embraced “ effective accelerationism ”, or the “deliberate propulsion of technological development” without guardrails. Meanwhile, even darker philosophies are finding a wider audience, like the neoreactionary pro-monarchy rants of the coder Curtis Yarvin (another one of Thiel’s intellectual touchstones), or the “ pro-natalism ” movement’s obsession with dramatically increasing the number of “western” babies (a Musk fixation), as well as the exit guru Srinivasan’s vision of a “tech zionist” San Francisco where corporate loyalists and police join forces to politically cleanse the city of liberals to make way for their networked apartheid state. View image in fullscreen Marc Andreessen and Balaji Srinivasan speak during a panel discussion about bitcoin in San Francisco in 2014. Photograph: Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images As the AI scholars Timnit Gebru and Émile P Torres have written , though the methods may be new, this “bundle” of ideological fads “are direct descendants of first-wave eugenics”, which also saw a small subset of humanity making decisions about which parts of the whole were worth continuing and which needed to be phased out, cleared out, or terminated. Until recently, few paid attention. Much like Próspera, where members can already experiment with human-machine mergers such as having their Tesla keys implanted into their hands, these intellectual fads seemed to be the marginal hobby horses of a few Bay Area dilettantes with money and caution to burn. No longer. Three recent material developments have accelerated end times fascism’s apocalyptic appeal. The first is the climate crisis. While some high-profile figures might still publicly deny or minimize the threat, global elites, whose ocean-front properties and datacenters are intensely vulnerable to rising temperatures and sea levels, are well-versed in the ramifying perils of an ever-heating world. The second is Covid-19: epidemiological models had long predicted the possibility of a pandemic devastating our globally networked world; the actual arrival of one was taken by many powerful people as a sign that we have officially arrived at what US military analysts forecasted as “the Age of Consequences”. No more predictions, it’s going down. The third factor is the rapid advancement and adoption of AI, a set of technologies that have long been associated with sci-fi terrors about machines turning on their makers with ruthless efficiency – fears expressed most forcefully by the same people who are developing these technologies. All of these existential crises are layered on top of escalating tensions between nuclear-armed powers. None of this should be written off as paranoia. Many of us feel the imminence of breakdown so acutely that we cope by entertaining ourselves with various versions of life in a post-apocalyptic bunker, streaming Apple’s Silo or Hulu’s Paradise . As the UK analyst and editor Richard Seymour reminds us in his recent book, Disaster Nationalism: “The apocalypse is no mere fantasy. We are living in it, after all, from deadly viruses to soil erosion, from economic crisis to geopolitical chaos.” The forces we are up against have made peace with mass death. They are treasonous to this world and its human and non-human inhabitants Trump 2.0’s economic project is a Frankenstein’s monster of the industries driving all of these threats – fossil fuels, weapons and resource-ravenous cryptocurrency and AI. Everyone involved in these sectors knows that there is no way to build the artificial mirror world that AI promises to construct without sacrificing this world – these technologies consume too much energy, too many critical minerals, and too much water for the two to coexist in any kind of equilibrium. This month, the former Google executive Eric Schmidt admitted as much, telling Congress that AI’s “profound” energy needs are projected to triple in the next few years, with much of it coming from fossil fuels, because nuclear can’t come online fast enough. This planet-incinerating level of consumption is necessary, he explained, to enable an intelligence “higher” than humanity, a digital god rising from the ashes of our relinquished world. And they are worried – just not about the actual threats they are unleashing. What keeps the leaders of these entangled industries up at night is the prospect of a civilizational wake-up call – of serious, internationally coordinated government efforts to rein in their rogue sectors before it’s too late. From the perspective of their ever-expanding bottom lines, the apocalypse is not collapse; it’s regulation. The fact that their profits are predicated on planetary devastation helps explain why do-gooder discourse among the powerful is giving way to open expressions of disdain for the idea that we owe each other anything by right of our shared humanity. Silicon Valley is done with altruism, effective or otherwise. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg pines for a culture that celebrates “aggression”. Alex Karp, Thiel’s business partner at the surveillance firm Palantir Technologies, rebukes the “losing” “self-flagellation” of those who question American superiority and the benefits of autonomous weapons systems (and, by association, the lucrative military contracts that have made Karp’s vast fortune). Musk informs Joe Rogan that empathy is “the fundamental weakness of western civilization” and he vents , after failing to purchase a supreme court election in Wisconsin: “It increasingly appears that humanity is a biological bootloader for digital superintelligence.” Meaning we humans are nothing but grist for Grok, the AI service he owns. (He did tell us he was “dark Maga” – and he’s not the only one.) In arid and climate-stressed Spain, one of the groups calling for a moratorium on new datacenters calls itself Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “your cloud is drying my river”. The name is fitting, and not just for Spain. An unspeakably dismal choice is being made before our eyes and without our consent: machines over humans, inanimate over animate, profits over all else. With stunning speed, the big tech megalomaniacs have quietly rolled back their net-zero pledges and lined up by Trump’s side, hellbent on sacrificing this world’s real and precious resources and creativity at the altar of a vampiric, virtual realm. This is the last great heist, and they are getting ready to ride out the storms they themselves are summoning – and they will try to defame and destroy anyone who gets in their way. Consider Vance’s recent European sojourn, where the vice-president harangued world leaders for “handwringing about safety” in relation to job-destroying AI while demanding Nazi and fascist speech go uncurtailed online. At one point he made a telling aside, expecting a laugh that never came: “If American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg’s scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk.” View image in fullscreen JD Vance speaks at the Munich Security Conference in February. Photograph: dts News Agency Germany/REX/Shutterstock His comment echoed those made by his equally humorless patron Thiel. In recent interviews focused on the theological underpinnings of his far-right politics, the Christian billionaire has repeatedly compared the indefatigable young climate activist to the antichrist – a figure he warns was prophesied to come bearing a misleading message of “peace and safety”. “If Greta gets everyone on the planet to ride a bicycle, maybe that’s a way to solve climate change, but it has sort of this quality of going from the frying pan into the fire,” Thiel intoned. Why Thunberg, why now? In part, it’s clearly the apocalyptic fear of regulation eating into their super-profits: according to Thiel, the science-based climate action Thunberg and others demand could only be enforced by a “totalitarian state”, which he claims is more dire a threat than climate breakdown (most distressingly, the taxes under such conditions would be “quite high” ). There may also be something else about Thunberg that frightens them: her steadfast commitment to this planet and the many life forms who call it home – not to simulations of this world generated by AI, or to a hierarchy of those deserving of life and those who are not, nor to any of the various extra-planetary escape fantasies the end times fascists are selling. She is committed to staying, while the end times fascists have, at least in their imaginings, already left this realm, ensconced in their opulent shelters or transcended to the digital ether, or to Mars. Shortly after Trump’s re-election, one of us had the opportunity to interview Anohni, one of the few musicians who have attempted to make art that wraps its arms around the death drive that has gripped our world. Asked about what connects the willingness of powerful people to let the planet burn and the drive to deny bodily autonomy to women and to trans people like her, she responded by drawing on her Irish Catholic upbringing: it’s “a very long-held myth that we are enacting and embodying. This is the culmination of their Rapture. This is their escape from the voluptuous cycle of creation. This is their escape from Mother.” View image in fullscreen How do we break this apocalyptic fever? First, we help each other face the depth of the depravity that has gripped the hard right in all of our countries. To move forward with focus, we must first understand this simple fact: we are up against an ideology that has given up not only on the premise and promise of liberal democracy but on the livability of our shared world – on its beauty, on its people, on our children, on other species. The forces we are up against have made peace with mass death. They are treasonous to this world and its human and non-human inhabitants. Second, we counter their apocalyptic narratives with a far better story about how to survive the hard times ahead without leaving anyone behind. A story capable of draining end times fascism of its gothic power and galvanizing a movement ready to put it all on the line for our collective survival. A story not of end times, but of better times; not of separation and supremacy, but of interdependence and belonging; not of escaping, but staying put and staying faithful to the troubled earthly reality in which we are enmeshed and bound. This basic sentiment, of course, is not new. It is central to Indigenous cosmologies, and it lies at the heart of animism. Go back far enough and every culture and faith has its own tradition of respecting the sanctity of here, and not searching for Zion in an elusive ever-distant promised land. In eastern Europe, before the fascist and Stalinist annihilations, the Jewish socialist Labor Bund organized around the yiddish concept of Doikayt , or “hereness”. Molly Crabapple, who has written a forthcoming book about this neglected history, defines Doikayt as the right to “fight for freedom and safety in the places where they lived, in defiance of everyone who wanted them dead” – and rather than be forced to flee to safety in Palestine or the United States. Perhaps what is needed is a modern-day universalization of that concept: a commitment to the right to the “hereness” of this particular ailing planet, to these frail bodies, to the right to live in dignity wherever on the planet we are, even when the inevitable shocks forces us to move. “Hereness” can be portable, free of nationalism, rooted in solidarity, respectful of indigenous rights and unbounded by borders. View image in fullscreen Anti-Trump protesters march against the administration in New York in January. Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The Guardian That future would require its own apocalypse, its own world-ending and revelation, though of a very different sort. Because as the scholar of policing Robyn Maynard has observed : “In order to make earthly planetary survival possible, some versions of this world need to end.” We have reached a choice point, not about whether we are facing apocalypse but what form it will take. The activist sisters Adrienne Maree and Autumn Brown touched on this recently on their aptly named podcast, How to Survive the End of the World. In this moment, when end times fascism is waging war on every front, new alliances are essential. But instead of asking: “Do we all share the same worldview?” Adrienne urges us to ask: “Is your heart beating and do you plan to live? Then come this way and we will figure out the rest on the other side.” To have a hope of combating the end times fascists, with their ever-constricting and asphyxiating concentric circles of “ordered love”, we will need to build an unruly open-hearted movement of the Earth-loving faithful: faithful to this planet, its people, its creatures and to the possibility of a livable future for us all. Faithful to here. Or, to quote Anohni again, this time referring to the goddess in which she now places her faith: “Have you stopped to consider that this might have been her best idea?” Spot illustrations by Sophy Hollington Explore more on these topics Far right (US) The featured essay US politics Donald Trump Peter Thiel Elon Musk Kristi Noem Naomi Klein Share Most viewed Most viewed US US politics World Climate crisis Middle East Ukraine Soccer Business Environment Tech Science Newsletters Wellness News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints &amp; corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms &amp; conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top © 2025 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Purpose . My first term included numerous significant actions, including some of the most aggressive in recent history, to deliver lower prescription drug prices to American patients. The message was clear: no longer would the executive branch sit idly by as pharmaceutical manufacturers charged patients in our Nation more than those in other countries for the exact same prescription drugs, often made in the exact same places. These actions included encouraging the development of generic and biosimilar alternatives to higher cost brand name prescription drugs and biologics to harness competitive forces and increase access to affordable medicines. The United States also, for the first time, established a pathway to expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country. Reform efforts ensured that Government-mandated discounts were passed through to patients instead of being retained by middlemen. New price transparency rules were promulgated to allow patients, doctors, and employers to see the actual cost of prescription drugs before purchase. Insulin copayments were capped for Medicare beneficiaries, and manufacturers, instead of patients and taxpayers, were forced to foot the bill through the provision of larger discounts. I also called on the Congress to come to the table to help craft sustainable solutions that would promote innovation and affordable access for the long-term. When the Congress refused, I proposed the test of an innovative new payment mechanism that would prevent drug manufacturers from charging our patients much higher prices than those found abroad. Combined, these bold actions were delivering real savings for American patients and set the foundation to dramatically narrow the price disparity between the United States and foreign nations over time. Unsurprisingly, the Biden Administration reversed, walked back, or neglected many of these initiatives, undoing the progress made for American patients. The Biden Administration then signed into law the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, which included the Medicare Prescription Drug Negotiation Program. While this program has the commendable goal of reducing the drug prices Medicare and its beneficiaries pay, its administratively complex and expensive regime has thus far produced much lower savings than projected. Further, accompanying changes to the Medicare Part D program led to inflated premiums and diminished coverage choices for seniors, prompting a taxpayer-funded bailout of insurance companies offering Part D plans. Finally, the program imposes price controls on small molecule prescription drugs, usually in tablet or capsule form, 4 years earlier than on large molecule biological products. Known as the &#8220;pill penalty,&#8221; this discrepancy threatens to distort innovation by pushing investment towards expensive biological products, which are often indicated to treat rarer diseases, and away from small molecule prescription drugs, which are generally cheaper and treat larger patient populations. The American people deserve better. It is time to restore the progress our Nation made in my first term to deliver lower prescription drug prices by putting Americans first and making America healthy again. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States that Federal health care programs, intellectual property protections, and safety regulations are optimized to provide access to prescription drugs at lower costs to American patients and taxpayers. Sec . 3 . Improving upon the Inflation Reduction Act . (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), consistent with sections 1191 to 1198 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320f-1320f-7) and other applicable law, shall propose and seek comment on guidance for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program for initial price applicability year 2028 and manufacturer effectuation of maximum fair price under such program in 2026, 2027, and 2028. The guidance shall improve the transparency of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, prioritize the selection of prescription drugs with high costs to the Medicare program, and minimize any negative impacts of the maximum fair price on pharmaceutical innovation within the United States. (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with the Secretary, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director), and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall provide recommendations to the President on how best to stabilize and reduce Medicare Part D premiums. (c) The Secretary shall work with the Congress to modify the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program to align the treatment of small molecule prescription drugs with that of biological products, ending the distortion that undermines relative investment in small molecule prescription drugs, coupled with other reforms to prevent any increase in overall costs to Medicare and its beneficiaries. Sec . 4 . Reducing the Prices of High-Cost Drugs for Seniors . Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to develop and implement a rulemaking plan and select for testing, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2), a payment model to improve the ability of the Medicare program to obtain better value for high-cost prescription drugs and biological products covered by Medicare, including those not subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. Sec . 5 . Appropriately Accounting for Acquisition Costs of Drugs in Medicare . Within 180 days of the date of this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a plan to conduct a survey under section 1833(t)(14)(D)(ii) of the Social Security Act to determine the hospital acquisition cost for covered outpatient drugs at hospital outpatient departments. Following the conclusion of this survey, the Secretary shall consider and propose any appropriate adjustments that would align Medicare payment with the cost of acquisition, consistent with the budget neutrality requirement in section 1833(t)(9)(B) of the Social Security Act and other legal requirements. Sec . 6 . Promoting Innovation, Value, and Enhanced Oversight in Medicaid Drug Payment . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, in coordination with the Secretary, shall jointly provide recommendations to the President on how best to ensure that manufacturers pay accurate Medicaid drug rebates consistent with section 1927 of the Social Security Act, promote innovation in Medicaid drug payment methodologies, link payments for drugs to the value obtained, and support States in managing drug spending. Sec . 7 . Access to Affordable Life-Saving Medications . Within 90 days of the date of this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary shall take action to ensure future grants available under section 330(e) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), are conditioned upon health centers establishing practices to make insulin and injectable epinephrine available at or below the discounted price paid by the health center grantee or sub-grantee under the 340B Prescription Drug Program (plus a minimal administration fee) to individuals with low incomes, as determined by the Secretary, who: (a) have a high cost-sharing requirement for either insulin or injectable epinephrine; (b) have a high unmet deductible; or (c) have no healthcare insurance.

Responsibility for Determining Eligibility for Public Benefits . (a) As set forth in Executive Order 14218 of February 19, 2025 (Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders), both Federal law (title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193)) and principles of sound administration demand that taxpayer-funded benefits be provided only to eligible persons and not encourage or reward illegal immigration to the United States. This interest is especially compelling with respect to Social Security Act benefits, which demand strict policing of fraud, waste, and abuse to ensure future eligible individuals receive the benefits to which they are entitled. Consequently, this memorandum gives additional direction for implementing Executive Order 14218 with regard to Social Security Act programs. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Commissioner of Social Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security as necessary, shall take all reasonable measures, consistent with applicable law, to ensure ineligible aliens are not receiving funds from Social Security Act programs.&nbsp; Such measures shall include promulgating any necessary guidance or regulations regarding Social Security Act funds and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with law, prioritizing civil or administrative enforcement actions against States, localities, or other similar grantees or subgrantees that do not take adequate measures to verify eligibility, stop payments to deceased or otherwise ineligible payees, or otherwise prevent ineligible aliens from receiving funds from Social Security Act programs. (c) The Attorney General and the Commissioner of Social Security shall cooperate to detail and credential such Special Assistant United States Attorneys as are necessary to expand the Social Security Administration&#8217;s (SSA) full-time fraud prosecutor program to at least 50 United States Attorney Offices by October 1, 2025. Likewise, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate to establish a similar fraud-prosecutor program utilizing Special Assistant United States Attorneys with regard to programs administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which shall operate in at least 15 United States Attorney Offices by October 1, 2025. Detailees in both programs shall emphasize prosecutions of identity theft and beneficiary-side fraud. To the extent feasible, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Commissioner of Social Security, as applicable, shall prioritize assigning new detailees in both programs to the 10 United States Attorney Offices whose jurisdictions encompass the largest known populations of illegal aliens, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security. (d)&nbsp; The risk of beneficiary- or recipient-side fraud and abuse by illegal aliens shall also be reduced through other program-integrity measures. (i) The Inspector General of the SSA noted in a July 2023 audit that death information regarding millions of deceased number holders is missing from the agency&#8217;s files, which obstructs efforts to prevent and detect fraud and improper payments across the Government with respect to executive departments and agencies that rely on SSA&#8217;s information. The Commissioner of Social Security shall fully implement the recommendations in the Inspector General of the SSA&#8217;s Audit Report A-06-21-51022. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate fully with such implementation. (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; The same audit report revealed that the SSA does not investigate or attempt to resolve reports of earnings received by individuals age 100 or older if the SSA has not recorded death information for such individuals, even when the reported wage-earner does not match the name or other personally identifiable information in SSA records, which may indicate identity theft, illegal work, tax evasion, or other unlawful activity.&nbsp; The Commissioner of Social Security shall refer promptly to the Inspector General of the SSA all earnings reports for persons age 100 or older when the purported wage-earner&#8217;s name does not match SSA&#8217;s files. &nbsp;The Inspector General of the SSA shall investigate such matters as appropriate and refer matters to the Department of Justice, other executive departments and agencies, or local prosecutors as warranted. (iii)&nbsp; Finally, within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Commissioner of Social Security shall review whether, and under what conditions, SSA should resume pursuing civil monetary penalties under section 1129 of the Social Security Act.&nbsp; If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that resumption is warranted, he shall either resume such program immediately or pursue regulatory or policy changes that would allow its resumption in a timely manner. Sec . 2 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United&nbsp;States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The Commissioner of Social Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the&nbsp; Federal Register . DONALD J.

Purpose and Policy . Safe communities rely on the backbone and heroism of a tough and well-equipped police force. My Administration is steadfastly committed to empowering State and local law enforcement to firmly police dangerous criminal behavior and protect innocent citizens. When local leaders demonize law enforcement and impose legal and political handcuffs that make aggressively enforcing the law impossible, crime thrives and innocent citizens and small business owners suffer. My Administration will therefore: establish best practices at the State and local level for cities to unleash high-impact local police forces; protect and defend law enforcement officers wrongly accused and abused by State or local officials; and surge resources to officers in need. My Administration will work to ensure that law enforcement officers across America focus on ending crime, not pursuing harmful, illegal race- and sex-based &#8220;equity&#8221; policies. The result will be a law-abiding society in which tenacious law enforcement officers protect the innocent, violations of law are not tolerated, and American communities are safely enjoyed by all their citizens again. Sec . 2 . Legal Defense of Law Enforcement Officers . The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to create a mechanism to provide legal resources and indemnification to law enforcement officers who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law. This mechanism shall include the use of private-sector pro bono assistance for such law enforcement officers. Sec . 3 . Empowering State and Local Law Enforcement . (a) The Attorney General and other appropriate heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to maximize the use of Federal resources to: (i) provide new best practices to State and local law enforcement to aggressively police communities against all crimes; (ii) expand access and improve the quality of training available to State and local law enforcement; (iii) increase pay and benefits for law enforcement officers; (iv) strengthen and expand legal protections for law enforcement officers; (v) seek enhanced sentences for crimes against law enforcement officers; (vi) promote investment in the security and capacity of prisons; and (vii) increase the investment in and collection, distribution, and uniformity of crime data across jurisdictions. (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General shall review all ongoing Federal consent decrees, out-of-court agreements, and post-judgment orders to which a State or local law enforcement agency is a party and modify, rescind, or move to conclude such measures that unduly impede the performance of law enforcement functions. Sec . 4 . Using National Security Assets for Law and Order . (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the heads of agencies as appropriate, shall increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall determine how military and national security assets, training, non-lethal capabilities, and personnel can most effectively be utilized to prevent crime. Sec . 5 . Holding State and Local Officials Accountable . The Attorney General shall pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to enforce the rights of Americans impacted by crime and shall prioritize prosecution of any applicable violations of Federal criminal law with respect to State and local jurisdictions whose officials: (a) willfully and unlawfully direct the obstruction of criminal law, including by directly and unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement officers from carrying out duties necessary for public safety and law enforcement; or (b) unlawfully engage in discrimination or civil-rights violations under the guise of &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; initiatives that restrict law enforcement activity or endanger citizens. Sec . 6 . Use of Homeland Security Task Forces . The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall utilize the Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) formed in accordance with Executive Order 14159 of January 20, 2025 (Protecting the American People Against Invasion) to coordinate and advance the objectives of this order. Sec . 7 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: i. the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or ii. the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Department of Justice shall provide funding for this order&#8217;s publication in the Federal Register . DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, April 28, 2025.

Purpose and Policy . Federal supremacy with respect to immigration, national security, and foreign policy is axiomatic. The Constitution provides the Federal Government with plenary authority regarding immigration to protect the sovereignty of our Nation and to conduct relations with other nations, who must be able to deal with one national Government on such matters. This power is sometimes contained in specific constitutional provisions: Article II of the Constitution vests the power to protect national security and conduct foreign policy in the President of the United States, and Article IV, Section 4, requires the Federal Government to &#8220;protect each of [the States] against Invasion.&#8221; This Federal power over immigration is also an inherent element of national sovereignty. The prior administration allowed unchecked millions of aliens to illegally enter the United States. The resulting public safety and national security risks are exacerbated by the presence of, and control of territory by, international cartels and other transnational criminal organizations along the southern border, as well as terrorists and other malign actors who intend to harm the United States and the American people. This invasion at the southern border requires the Federal Government to take measures to fulfill its obligation to the States. Yet some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws. This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government&#8217;s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States. Beyond the intolerable national security risks, such nullification efforts often violate Federal criminal laws, including those prohibiting obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), unlawfully harboring or hiring illegal aliens (8 U.S.C. 1324), conspiracy against the United States (18 U.S.C. 371), and conspiracy to impede Federal law enforcement (18 U.S.C. 372). Assisting aliens in violating Federal immigration law could also violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.). Some measures to assist illegal aliens also necessarily violate Federal laws prohibiting discrimination against Americans in favor of illegal aliens and protecting Americans&#8217; civil rights. It is imperative that the Federal Government restore the enforcement of United States law. Sec . 2 . Designation of &#8220;Sanctuary&#8221; Jurisdictions . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall publish a list of States and local jurisdictions that obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws (sanctuary jurisdictions). After this initial publication, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall update this list as necessary. (b) Immediately following each publication under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall notify each sanctuary jurisdiction regarding its defiance of Federal immigration law enforcement and any potential violations of Federal criminal law. Sec . 3 . Consequences for Sanctuary Jurisdiction Status . (a) With respect to sanctuary jurisdictions that are designated under section 2(a) of this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and as permitted by law, shall identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate. (b) With respect to jurisdictions that remain sanctuary jurisdictions after State or local officials are provided notice of such status under section 2(b) of this order and yet remain in defiance of Federal law, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to end these violations and bring such jurisdictions into compliance with the laws of the United States. Sec . 4 . Preventing Federal Benefits for Aliens in Sanctuary Jurisdictions . The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall develop guidance, rules, or other appropriate mechanisms to ensure appropriate eligibility verification is conducted for individuals receiving Federal public benefits within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. 1611(c) from private entities in a sanctuary jurisdiction, whether such verification is conducted by the private entity or by a governmental entity on its behalf. Sec . 5 . Equal Treatment of Americans . The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and appropriate agency heads, shall identify and take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State and local laws, regulations, policies, and practices favoring aliens over any groups of American citizens that are unlawful, preempted by Federal law, or otherwise unenforceable, including State laws that provide in-State higher education tuition to aliens but not to out-of-State American citizens that may violate 8 U.S.C. 1623 or that favor aliens in criminal charges or sentencing. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Purpose and Policy . It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce the historic and robust protections for religious liberty enshrined in Federal law. The Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices and views are integral to a vibrant public square and human flourishing and in which religious people and institutions are free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or hostility from the Government. Indeed, the roots of religious liberty stretch back to the early settlers who fled religious persecution in Europe, seeking a new world where they could choose, follow, and practice their faith without interference from the Government. The principle of religious liberty was enshrined in American law with the First Amendment to the Constitution in 1791. Since that time, the Constitution has protected the fundamental right to religious liberty as Americans&#8217; first freedom. During my first term, I issued Executive Order 13798 of May 4, 2017 (Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty). Pursuant to that order, the Attorney General issued a memorandum for all executive departments and agencies (agencies) titled &#8220;Federal Law Protections for Religious Liberty&#8221; on October 6, 2017. The Supreme Court has also continued to vindicate the Founders&#8217; commitment to religious liberty, including by giving effect to the principle that religious voices should be welcomed on an equal basis in the public square. In recent years, some Federal, State, and local policies have threatened America&#8217;s unique and beautiful tradition of religious liberty. These policies attempt to infringe upon longstanding conscience protections, prevent parents from sending their children to religious schools, threaten loss of funding or denial of non-profit tax status for faith-based entities, and single out religious groups and institutions for exclusion from governmental programs. Some opponents of religious liberty would remove religion entirely from public life. Others characterize religious liberty as inconsistent with civil rights, despite religions&#8217; vital roles in the abolition of slavery; the passage of Federal civil rights laws; and the provision of indispensable social, educational, and health services. President Ronald Reagan reminded us that &#8220;freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.&#8221; Americans need to be reacquainted with our Nation&#8217;s superb experiment in religious freedom in order to preserve it against emerging threats. Therefore, the Federal Government will promote citizens&#8217; pride in our foundational history, identify emerging threats to religious liberty, uphold Federal laws that protect all citizens&#8217; full participation in a pluralistic democracy, and protect the free exercise of religion. Sec . 2 . Establishment of the Religious Liberty Commission . (a) There is hereby established the Religious Liberty Commission (Commission). (b) The Commission shall function as follows: (i) The Commission shall be composed of up to 14 members appointed by the President. Members of the Commission shall include individuals chosen to serve as educated representatives of various sectors of society, including the private sector, employers, educational institutions, religious communities, and States, to offer diverse perspectives on how the Federal Government can defend religious liberty for all Americans. The President shall designate a Chairman and Vice Chairman from among the members. The Commission shall also include the following ex officio members or such senior officials as those members may designate: (A) the Attorney General; (B) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and (C) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. (ii) Members appointed to the Commission shall serve one term ending on July 4, 2026, which marks the 250th anniversary of American Independence. If the term of the Commission is extended by the President beyond July 4, 2026, members shall be eligible for reappointment for a 2-year term. Members may continue to serve after the expiration of their terms until the appointment of a successor. (iii) The Commission shall produce a comprehensive report on the foundations of religious liberty in America, the impact of religious liberty on American society, current threats to domestic religious liberty, strategies to preserve and enhance religious liberty protections for future generations, and programs to increase awareness of and celebrate America&#8217;s peaceful religious pluralism. Specific topics to be considered by the Commission under these categories shall include the following areas: the First Amendment rights of pastors, religious leaders, houses of worship, faith-based institutions, and religious speakers; attacks across America on houses of worship of many religions; debanking of religious entities; the First Amendment rights of teachers, students, military chaplains, service members, employers, and employees; conscience protections in the health care field and concerning vaccine mandates; parents&#8217; authority to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children, including the right to choose a religious education; permitting time for voluntary prayer and religious instruction at public schools; Government displays with religious imagery; and the right of all Americans to freely exercise their faith without fear or Government censorship or retaliation. (iv) The Commission shall advise the White House Faith Office and the Domestic Policy Council on religious liberty policies of the United States. Specific activities of the Commission shall include, to the extent permitted by law, recommending steps to secure domestic religious liberty by executive or legislative actions as well as identifying opportunities for the White House Faith Office to partner with the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom to further the cause of religious liberty around the world. (v) Members of the Commission shall serve without any compensation for their work on the Commission. Members of the Commission, while engaged in the work of the Commission, may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, to the extent permitted by law for persons serving intermittently in Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707), consistent with the availability of funds. (vi) To advise members of the Commission: (A) An Advisory Board of Religious Leaders shall be designated by the President and shall consist of not more than 15 members. The Advisory Board of Religious Leaders shall be a subcomponent of the Commission and report to the Chairman of the Commission; (B) An Advisory Board of Lay Leaders from religious congregations shall be designated by the President and shall consist of not more than 15 members. The Advisory Board of Lay Leaders shall be a subcomponent of the Commission and report to the Chairman of the Commission; and (C) An Advisory Board of Legal Experts shall be designated by the President and shall consist of the Attorney General, or the Attorney General&#8217;s designee, and not more than 10 attorneys. The Advisory Board of Legal Experts shall be a subcomponent of the Commission and report to the Chairman of the Commission. (vii) The Commission shall terminate on July 4, 2026, which marks the 250th anniversary of American Independence, unless extended by the President. (viii) The Department of Justice shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the Commission may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations. (ix) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act (chapter 10 of title 5, United States Code) may apply to the Commission or any of its Advisory Boards, any functions of the President under that Act, except for those in sections 1005 and 1013 of that Act, shall be performed by the Attorney General, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services. Sec . 3 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any agency, person, or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other agencies, persons, or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

"How Palantir, the secretive tech company, is rising in the Trump era",NPR,2025-05-01,https://www.npr.org/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5372776/palantir-tech-contracts-trump,"Palantir CEO Alex Karp could not suppress his excitement. He was on an earnings call in February with the data-mining company's shareholders. Its profits were skyrocketing. Karp was bursting with glee. ""We're doing it! We're doing it!"" Karp exclaimed. ""And I'm sure you're enjoying this as much as I am!"" Indeed, Karp and Palantir investors have much to enjoy. Palantir — the name comes from the ""seeing stones"" from ""Lord of the Rings"" — has been booming: Its stock market valuation has climbed from $50 billion a year ago to approaching $300 billion today. A company that few outside tech and national security circles would recognize is now worth more than Verizon or Disney and nearly as much as Bank of America. Sponsor Message ""Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and when it's necessary to scare our enemies and, on occasion, kill them,"" Karp said on the investor call. Promoting how the company's products assist in killing is an unusual corporate pitch, but it is indicative of Karp's brash and bombastic style. He once said he would love to spray his critics with ""light fentanyl-laced urine."" The tousle-haired 57-year-old billionaire holds a doctorate in neoclassical social theory, and when he is not philosophizing about Palantir, he can be found Nordic skiing or practicing tai chi (he keeps a wooden tai chi sword in his office). He describes himself as a ""progressive warrior"" whose support of Democrats over the years, including Kamala Harris for president, has been in contrast to Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a billionaire who's one of President Trump's longtime backers. Where Karp and Thiel merge is around a shared devotion for developing data-analyzing intelligence tools to, as Karp has put it, ""power the West to its obvious, innate superiority."" Now in Trump's second term, Palantir is emerging as a key private contractor as the administration intensifies its crackdown on people who are in the U.S. without legal status. Sponsor Message From Gaza to Trump's immigration crackdown While the company is famously secretive, it does, at times, lift the veil on its technology. Palantir's AI software is used by the Israel Defense Forces to strike targets in Gaza; it's used to assist the Defense Department in analyzing drone footage; and the Los Angeles Police Department relied on Palantir's ""predictive policing"" tools to forecast crime patterns. ""We are not a commodity. We do not want our customers to be commodities — we want them to be individual titans that are dominating their industry or the battlefield,"" Karp said in a November earnings call. A Palantir Skykit is displayed at the company's booth during the CES trade show in 2023. The Skykit looks like a large, black sturdy box with its top lid raised. On the inside of the lid are two screens, and inside the box are a laptop computer and other pieces of technical equipment. A Palantir Skykit is displayed at the company's booth during the CES trade show in Las Vegas on Jan. 5, 2023. The Skykit incorporates Palantir's software, along with a UAV drone, a trail camera, battery packs and a SpaceX Starlink terminal, into a self-contained defense intelligence package deployable to hostile environments. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images Immigration and Customs Enforcement records show Palantir recently received a $30 million contract to build a platform to track migrant movements in real time. Wired and CNN have reported that Palantir is being tapped by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to create a master immigration database to speed up deportations. And DOGE has hired numerous former Palantir employees. Palantir's new work with the Trump administration follows two decades of gaining ever-larger government contracts. In November, Palantir secured a nearly $1 billion software contract with the Navy. Since Trump took office, Palantir's has been eyeing even more government work, and the company's stock has surged more than 200% from the day before Trump was elected. ""Having political connections and inroads with Peter Thiel and Elon Musk certainly helps them,"" said Michael McGrath, the former chief executive of i2, a data analytics firm that competes with Palantir. ""It makes deals come faster without a lot of negotiation and pressure."" Venture capitalist calls on Palantir to ward off abuses of its technology With Palantir's profile rising, its critics are getting louder. Following news of the company providing the Trump administration with help in immigration enforcement and deportations, prominent Silicon Valley investor Paul Graham accused Palantir of ""building the infrastructure of the police state,"" asking a Palantir executive on X to commit to not building products that could be used to help the U.S. government violate citizens' constitutional rights. Sponsor Message Palantir's global head of commercial, Ted Mabrey, responded that the company has ""made this promise so many ways from Sunday"" and that Palantir employees ""believe they are making the world a better place every single day."" In an email exchange with NPR, Graham said he remains frustrated with Palantir's response. ""Palantir may try to act huffy and respond that it's unthinkable that the U.S. government would do this. But with this administration it's obviously thinkable,"" Graham wrote to NPR. ""This is the kind of administration where we may well need Stanislav Petrovs,"" he said, referring to the Soviet lieutenant colonel who is credited with helping to avert a nuclear war. ""We need to know if companies like Palantir are prepared to do that."" Palantir declined to comment for this story. The White House did not return a request for comment. Former Palantir employee speaks out against Trump administration work Juan Sebastián Pinto, a former Palantir employee, said in an interview with NPR that the company has built its brand on a single premise that has enabled it to deflect criticism. ""And it's that they've claimed to be a company that supports Western values,"" Pinto said. ""They express ideals about civil rights and freedom of speech, but now they're supporting an administration that is challenging democracy in new ways."" Pinto, who lives in Denver, where Palantir is based, wrote an essay in February in which he raised alarm about how the tech firm's sophisticated surveillance and AI tools were being used in the war in Gaza and by the Trump administration to speed up deportations. In this photo of Juan Sebastián Pinto, he's wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt with a brown vest over it. Behind him is a board that says ""State of Colorado"" and has what appears to be a Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep on it. Juan Sebastián Pinto is a former Palantir employee who is raising alarm about the potential abuse of the company's cutting-edge technology in the Trump administration. Taken by Peter Miller It represented a rare rebuke from an ex-employee of Palantir, where, Pinto said, workers typically leave only after signing legal documents ensuring they will not disparage the company. Pinto did not sign such an agreement when he left the company as a content strategist in late 2022. Sponsor Message ""What I really was doing is basically helping a company create a monopoly over artificial intelligence decision-making and do so first by targeting the federal government,"" he said, noting that the federal government was an easy target for business, since its software capabilities lag far behind Palantir's. The company has justified its contracts in the past by saying it is nonpartisan, having worked across multiple administrations. McGrath, the former tech executive, said it is true that both Democratic and Republican administrations have provided work to Palantir, since it has cemented a reputation in Washington for cutting-edge surveillance and data-mining tech. ""Their platforms can pull together information from tax returns, employment information, their immigration status, how many children they have, whether their children are legal or illegal. And then layer AI on top of that and predict movements and patterns. That can be a big asset. It also can be a big risk,"" he said. The risks, Pinto said, deserve more debate and scrutiny — which is why he said it is critical as a former employee to shed light on the societal implications of Palantir's services. ""I simply cannot live in a world where my grandchildren have to be processed through a database where their everyday activities, including social media posts, as citizens, are tracked, collected and used for an authoritarian government's policing database,"" he said. ""I don't want to live in that world, and I think it's worth risking my career, and even my personal safety, to speak out about this.""",8783

Purpose . During my first term, my Administration took unprecedented action to improve the well-being of the American people by restoring capacity for domestic production of critical pharmaceutical products. Notably, in Executive Order 13944 of August 6, 2020 (Combating Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National Security By Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made In The United States), I directed each executive department and agency involved in the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs to take a variety of actions to increase their domestic procurement of Essential Medicines , Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, as defined in section 7 of that order, and to identify vulnerabilities in our Nation&#8217;s supply chains for these products. Unfortunately, the prior administration did too little to advance these goals. Critical barriers and information gaps persist in establishing a domestic, resilient, and affordable pharmaceutical supply chain for American patients. One key area of concern is the length of time it takes to&nbsp;build pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the United States today. &nbsp;New construction must navigate myriad Federal, State, and local requirements ranging from building standards and zoning restrictions to environmental protocols that together diminish the certainty needed to generate investment for large manufacturing projects. &nbsp;For pharmaceutical manufacturing, these barriers are heightened by unannounced inspections of domestic manufacturers by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are more frequent than such inspections at international facilities. &nbsp;Industry estimates suggest that building new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals and critical inputs may take as long as 5 to 10 years, which is unacceptable from a national security standpoint. &nbsp;Even expanding existing capacity or modifying existing production lines to produce new or different products requires extensive permitting and regulatory approval, making it more difficult to repurpose existing underutilized pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity available domestically. It is in the best interest of the Nation to eliminate regulatory barriers to the domestic production of the medicines Americans need. &nbsp;My Administration will work to make the United States the most competitive nation in the world for the manufacture of safe and effective pharmaceutical products. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States that the regulation of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and inputs be streamlined to facilitate the restoration of a robust domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing base. Sec . 3 . Streamlining Review of Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by the Food and Drug Administration . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA Commissioner), shall review existing regulations and guidance that pertain to the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and shall take steps to eliminate any duplicative or unnecessary requirements in such regulations and guidance; maximize the timeliness and predictability of agency review; and streamline and accelerate the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing. The FDA Commissioner&#8217;s review shall encompass all regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity, emerging technologies that enable the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials in the United States. The FDA Commissioner shall: (a) &nbsp;evaluate the current risk-based approach to prior approval of licensure inspections, including when such inspections are necessary, and seek to improve upon this approach to ensure all required inspections are prompt, efficient, and limited to what is necessary to ensure compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other Federal law; (b) identify and undertake measures necessary to expand, as practicable, existing programs that provide early technical advice before a facility is operational; (c) &nbsp;identify and undertake measures necessary to improve enforcement of data reporting under section 510(j)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360(j)(3)), including consideration of publicly displaying the list of facilities, including foreign facilities, that are not in compliance; (d) &nbsp;provide clearer guidance regarding the requirements or recommendations for site changes, including moving production from a foreign to domestic facility, and validation of new or updated components necessary in manufacturing; and (e) &nbsp;review and, as appropriate, seek to update any other relevant compliance policies, guidance documents, and regulations. Sec . 4 . Enhancing Inspection of Foreign Manufacturing Facilities . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the FDA Commissioner shall develop and advance improvements to the risk-based inspection regime that ensures routine reviews of overseas manufacturing facilities involved in the supply of United States medicines, which shall be funded by increased fees on foreign manufacturing facilities to the extent consistent with applicable law.

Purpose . Dangerous gain-of-function research on biological agents and pathogens has the potential to significantly endanger the lives of American citizens. If left unrestricted, its effects can include widespread mortality, an impaired public health system, disrupted American livelihoods, and diminished economic and national security. The Biden Administration allowed dangerous gain-of-function research within the United States with insufficient levels of oversight. It also actively approved, through the National Institutes of Health, Federal life-science research funding in China and other countries where there is limited United States oversight or reasonable expectation of biosafety enforcement. This recklessness, if unaddressed, may lead to the proliferation of research on pathogens (and potential pathogens) in settings without adequate safeguards, even after COVID-19 revealed the risk of such practices. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to ensure that United States federally funded research benefits American citizens without jeopardizing our Nation&#8217;s security, strength, or prosperity. My Administration will balance the prevention of catastrophic consequences with maintaining readiness against biological threats and driving global leadership in biotechnology, biological countermeasures, biosecurity, and health research. Sec . 3 . Stop Dangerous Gain-of-Function Research . (a) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) identified by the Director of OSTP, shall establish guidance for the heads of relevant agencies, to the extent consistent with the terms and conditions of the funding, to immediately: (i) end Federal funding of dangerous gain-of-function research conducted by foreign entities in countries of concern (e.g., China) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6627(c), or in other countries where there is not adequate oversight to ensure that the countries are compliant with United States oversight standards and policies; and (ii) end Federal funding of other life-science research that is occurring in countries of concern or foreign countries where there is not adequate oversight to ensure that the countries are compliant with United States oversight standards and policies and that could reasonably pose a threat to public health, public safety, and economic or national security, as determined by the heads of relevant agencies. (b) The Director of OSTP, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the APNSA, and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall establish guidance for the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other relevant agencies with respect to suspension of federally funded dangerous gain-of-function research, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the relevant research funding, at least until the completion of the policy called for in section 4(a) of this order. Heads of agencies shall report any exception to a suspension to the Director of OSTP for review in consultation with the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies. Sec . 4 . Secure Future Research Through Commonsense Frameworks . (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6627 and in coordination with the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies, shall revise or replace the 2024 &#8220; United States Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential &#8221; to: (i) strengthen top-down independent oversight; increase accountability through enforcement, audits, and improved public transparency; and clearly define the scope of covered research while ensuring the United States remains the global leader in biotechnology, biological countermeasures, and health research; (ii) incorporate enforcement mechanisms, including those described in section 7 of this order, into Federal funding agreements to ensure compliance with all Federal policies governing dangerous gain-of-function research; and (iii) provide for review and revision at least every 4 years, or as appropriate. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP, in coordination with the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies, shall revise or replace the 2024 &#8220; Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening &#8221; (Framework) to ensure it takes a commonsense approach and effectively encourages providers of synthetic nucleic acid sequences to implement comprehensive, scalable, and verifiable synthetic nucleic acid procurement screening mechanisms to minimize the risk of misuse. The heads of all agencies that fund life-science research shall ensure that synthetic nucleic acid procurement is conducted through providers or manufacturers that adhere to the updated Framework. To ensure compliance, the updated Framework shall incorporate the enforcement mechanisms described in section 7 of this order. The Framework shall be reviewed and revised at least every 4 years, or as appropriate Sec . 5 . Manage Risks Associated with Non-federally Funded Research . Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the APNSA, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall develop and implement a strategy to govern, limit, and track dangerous gain-of-function research across the United States that occurs without Federal funding and other life-science research that could cause significant societal consequences. This strategy shall include actions to achieve comprehensive, scalable, and verifiable nucleic acid synthesis screening in non-federally funded settings. Any gaps in authorities necessary to achieve the goals of this strategy shall be addressed in a legislative proposal to be sent to the President, through the Director of OSTP and the APNSA, within 180 days of the date of this order. Sec . 6 . Increase Accountability and Public Transparency of Dangerous Gain-of-Function Research . The Director of OSTP, in coordination with the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies, shall ensure that the revised policy called for in section 4(a) of this order includes a mechanism whereby research institutions that receive Federal funding must report dangerous gain-of-function research, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, include research that is supported by non-Federal funding mechanisms. The reporting mechanism shall provide a publicly available source of information about research programs and awards identified pursuant to this section, including, where permitted by law, those that have been stopped or suspended pursuant to sections 3(a) and 3(b) of this order, and all future programs and awards that are covered by the updated policy developed in section 4(a) of this order. This reporting shall be conducted in a way that does not compromise national security or legitimate intellectual property interests of subject institutions. Sec . 7 . Future Enforcement Terms . The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other relevant agencies shall, consistent with existing laws and regulations, include in every life-science research contract or grant award: (a) a term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with the terms of this order and any applicable regulations promulgated by the contracting or grant-offering agency is material to the Government&#8217;s payment decisions for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 3729(b)(4); (b) a term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate, participate in, or fund any dangerous gain-of-function research or other life-science research in foreign countries that could cause significant societal consequences or generate unnecessary national security risks, and that does not comply with this order and the policies ordered herein; (c) a term stating that a violation of the terms of this order or any applicable regulations promulgated by the contracting or grant-offering agency by any grant recipient may be considered a violation of such term by the recipient&#8217;s employer or institution; and (d) a term stating that any grant recipient, employer, or institution found to be in violation of the terms of this order or any applicable regulations promulgated by the contracting or grant-making agency may be subject to immediate revocation of ongoing Federal funding, and up to a 5-year period of ineligibility for Federal life-sciences grant funds offered by the Department of Health and Human Services and other relevant agencies. Sec . 8 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order, &#8220;dangerous gain-of-function research&#8221; means scientific research on an infectious agent or toxin with the potential to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or increasing its transmissibility. Covered research activities are those that could result in significant societal consequences and that seek or achieve one or more of the following outcomes: (a) enhancing the harmful consequences of the agent or toxin; (b) disrupting beneficial immunological response or the effectiveness of an immunization against the agent or toxin; (c) conferring to the agent or toxin resistance to clinically or agriculturally useful prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against that agent or toxin or facilitating their ability to evade detection methodologies; (d) increasing the stability, transmissibility, or the ability to disseminate the agent or toxin; (e) altering the host range or tropism of the agent or toxin; (f) enhancing the susceptibility of a human host population to the agent or toxin; or (g) generating or reconstituting an eradicated or extinct agent or toxin. Sec . 9 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Department of Health and Human Services shall provide funding for this order&#8217;s publication in the Federal Register . DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 5, 2025.

Curtis Yarvin helped inspire DOGE. Now he scorns it.,The Washington Post,2025-05-08,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/08/curtis-yarvin-doge-musk-thiel/,"Before gutting the federal workforce became Elon Musk’s job, it was Curtis Yarvin’s dream. Yarvin — a Silicon Valley blogger and software developer who argues for replacing American democracy with a dictatorship — spent years outlining an assault on what he calls “the cathedral” of elite power and consensus. Long before the U.S. DOGE Service launched in January, Yarvin coined his own four-letter acronym for bureaucracy-slashing: RAGE, or “Retire All Government Employees.”Although he says he has never met Musk, Yarvin is a powerful influence among those carrying out DOGE’s radical cost-cutting agenda, two advisers to the effort said. One, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to describe the group’s work, said Yarvin had offered “the most crisp articulation” of what DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, is trying to achieve. “There’s this alliance of the media, of universities, of government,” the DOGE adviser said. “These people are capturing the government and using it for their own ends and for their own power. And that’s very scary to us. You want to lessen the power of the cathedral.” It’s not every day a neo-monarchist’s Substack helps shape disruptive federal policies. But Yarvin, 51, isn’t celebrating. In fact, in several recent interviews with The Washington Post, he offered a surprisingly harsh assessment of DOGE, comparing it to an orchestra of chimpanzees trying to perform Wagner. He also said the group’s attitude toward federal workers resembles that of a brash but insecure man who repels potential sexual partners. “In the worst aspects of DOGE, there’s this aspect of the incel who gets mad at the girl who won’t sleep with him,” Yarvin said, using the term for so-called involuntary celibates. “That’s not a powerful attitude.” The mixing of high and low analogies is characteristic of Yarvin, whose wildly discursive blog posts — which on a given day might analyze American politics with reference to Shakespeare, Stalin and “The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension” — have become required reading for the extremely online right. Among the better-known members of his audience are Vice President JD Vance and pro-Trump Silicon Valley investors Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel, the prominent Silicon Valley conservative who co-founded PayPal and Palantir, has embraced Yarvin's thinking. Yarvin considers Thiel to be “fully enlightened.” (Rebecca Blackwell/AP) Even in a political culture habituated to extremes, Yarvin plants his flag on the fringe. He has written that the late South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela was a terrorist comparable to the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik, admiringly described President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a more effective autocrat than Hitler and argued for replacing the existing global order with thousands of “sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions.” That such a provocative figure should deem the early activity of the second Trump administration too, well, provocative is among the many unpredictable developments since the president assumed office less than four months ago. Despite his informal role as secular prophet to DOGE and some Trump administration policymakers, Yarvin now asserts that Musk and President Donald Trump are needlessly harming and antagonizing government experts whose support they should be seeking. “It’s very shortsighted behavior from the standpoint of building capital, or building power,” Yarvin said. “They’re really acting on a seat-of-the-pants basis.”Yarvin’s DOGE disillusionment is somewhat surreal, almost as if Marx had lived long enough to troll the Bolsheviks for misreading “Das Kapital.” It is also, perhaps, an object lesson in the dangers of translating the often outlandish digital discourse that has shaped the American far right into real-world policies that have scaled back scientific research, jeopardized some lifesaving foreign aid programs and risked hobbling government services with mass firings. The White House declined to comment. Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment. Joshua Tait, a historian of conservatism who has written about Yarvin, said it was surprising but not necessarily out of character that Silicon Valley’s neo-monarchist muse has mixed feelings about the implementation of his ideas. Despite his jarringly bleak view of democracy, Yarvin has always had an unexpectedly optimistic vision of what government could achieve, Tait said. “I wonder if he has that utopian mindset that makes him clash with the ‘just own the libs’ ethos of some of DOGE — which is not to say that he didn’t spend a lot of time owning the libs,” Tait said. Still, Yarvin’s ambivalence “doesn’t always feel intellectually coherent,” Tait said. And as DOGE winds down its work — leaving behind a mangled but still defiant federal workforce and savings far short of the $2 trillion promised — Yarvin bears at least some responsibility, Tait argued. “I think he does own DOGE, regardless of what he says,” Tait said. “It would have been created, probably, regardless. But he spent a good chunk of time creating a justifying framework for it.” Inside the cathedral As Yarvin tells it, his childhood almost eerily reflected the left-leaning, elite circles he now condemns. His father, who he says was raised by communists, retired as a senior official in the U.S. Foreign Service. The young Yarvin spent years living abroad, eventually transferring from a British-run academy in Cyprus to a high school in Maryland. A math prodigy, he skipped three grades and graduated from Brown University at age 18 in 1992. Yarvin briefly enrolled in a doctoral program in computer science at the University of California at Berkeley, before dropping out to join a tech company. He created a computing platform, Urbit, in 2002 but did not find the vocation that would earn him a devoted following until 2007, when he launched the blog Unqualified Reservations. Writing under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug, a play on “goldbug” and a Confucian philosopher of the Zhou dynasty, Yarvin gradually constructed a radical critique of liberal democracy. Drawing on the scientist Richard Dawkins’s concept of “memes” — ideas that compete and replicate themselves through natural selection, just as genes do, without regard to their underlying truth — Yarvin argued that the egalitarian rhetoric of the left masked self-serving ideals whose true function was to expand elites’ power. Yarvin, 51, came to the Bay Area to study computer science but began devoting much of his time to an anti-democracy blog. (Ian Bates/For The Washington Post) The network that nurtures these concepts — the news media, universities and similar sources of supposed expertise — make up Yarvin’s “cathedral.” American leaders had become dangerously reliant on such institutions, he argued, diluting responsibility for the government’s diminishing performance. The antidote, in his view, was a system that would not “leak” power but concentrate it as much as possible — ideally in a single person. “The problem of choosing the ‘benevolent dictator,’ making sure he or she stays ‘benevolent,’ and replacing her or him with an equally benevolent successor, is not an impossible and unimaginable paradox,” Yarvin wrote. “It is an engineering problem.” Interspersed with these musings were inflammatory attacks on “cathedral” orthodoxy, notably on the subject of race. Yarvin wrote recurrently about crime committed by racial minorities, and he objected to government and business programs intended to elevate the status of African Americans. When “applied to populations with recent hunter-­gatherer ancestry and no great reputation for sturdy moral fiber,” he wrote in 2009, such initiatives were “a recipe for the production of absolute human garbage.” Yarvin told The Post that he still believes “tremendous inborn differences [exist] between people” and “between groups of people” and that progressive policies have not helped most Black Americans thrive. However, he said he would choose his words on racial dynamics more carefully today, and that his 2009 remark about minorities’ moral fiber was intended to have an intentionally archaic and “self-parodic” tone. “I would definitely phrase it differently, because there’s a kind of tongue-in-cheek there that gets lost,” said Yarvin, who today writes under his own name on a blog called “Gray Mirror of the Nihilist Prince.” Outcry over Yarvin’s writings on race and politics got him booted from a tech conference where he was slated to appear in 2015 and led some speakers and sponsors to pull out of another conference the following year. Scholars have also criticized his arguments, saying he misrepresents the historical record to celebrate forms of government that were considered deeply oppressive by those who lived under them. But his ideas have simultaneously found favor with powerful people. In emails to the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos that were published by BuzzFeed News, Yarvin said he watched the 2016 election at the home of Thiel, one of the few figures in the tech world to back Trump’s first presidential campaign. Yarvin wrote that he had been “coaching Thiel,” whom he described as “fully enlightened.” Thiel’s venture capital firm invested $250,000 in Tlon, a start-up Yarvin created to build out his computing platform, Yarvin said. A representative for the firm, Founders Fund, declined to comment. Thiel did not respond to requests for comment. Other early investors included the founding engineer of Skype, Jaan Tallinn, and the venture capital firm controlled by Andreessen, who has described Yarvin as a friend and has cited his ideas, according to the investment database PitchBook. Long a political moderate, Andreessen has become a Trump donor and informal adviser over the past year, and he helped recruit staff for DOGE, according to two people familiar with the group’s formation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe it. Two of Thiel’s politically ambitious protégés also embraced Yarvin’s thinking. Yarvin said he met Vance and Blake Masters — who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Arizona at the same time Vance ran and won in Ohio — before they entered politics, at social gatherings when they were Thiel’s employees. Both men cited Yarvin during their campaigns, specifically referring to RAGE, his proposal for dismantling the federal bureaucracy. “There’s this guy, Curtis Yarvin, who’s written about some of these things,” Vance said on a right-wing podcast in 2021. He went on to offer his advice to a then-hypothetical President Trump in his second term: “Fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, and replace them with our people. And when the courts — ’cause you will get taken to court — and when the courts stop you, stand before the country, like Andrew Jackson did, and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’” ‘Yarvin is the brain’ Yarvin has often seemed ambivalent about the spread of his ideas, expressing skepticism that a remaking of American government was feasible under Washington’s political constraints. The first Trump administration, he has written, took only “small, performative steps” to restore a sufficiently powerful chief executive. Even after Trump won a second term, Yarvin initially sounded dour notes, saying shortly before Trump was sworn in that he would probably not attend the inauguration. By Jan. 20, he had apparently changed his mind. Over inauguration weekend, Yarvin swapped out his hallmark leather jacket and cowboy boots for a tux, attending several exclusive parties in Washington and holding court at Butterworth’s, a Capitol Hill bar that has become the favorite haunt of young MAGA climbers. One night he was spotted in the bar’s basement with Grimes, the pop musician who is the mother of three of Musk’s children. Vice President JD Vance cited Yarvin during his 2022 Senate campaign, specifically referring to Yarvin's proposals for dismantling the federal bureaucracy. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Yarvin said he briefly spoke to Vance at another party at Thiel’s mansion in Northwest Washington. He told Politico that he also had lunch with Michael Anton, a senior State Department official. Shortly after returning to California, he wrote approvingly of the administration’s first days — characterized by pardons for the Jan. 6 rioters and a flurry of provocative executive orders — in a Substack post titled “The Pleasure of Error.” “After a week, I think it’s clear that Donald Trump was not engaging in hyperbole when he told the libs: ‘we will do things to you that have never been done before,’” Yarvin wrote. Musk had at this point embarked on his own mission, sending loyalists to tear through government agencies, hoover up citizens’ data, slash programs and force thousands from their jobs. The billionaire has taken such a forceful approach, according to people who know him, because he believes the government is deeply broken. Musk installed himself in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House, his 4-year-old son and his video-gaming computer in tow, exhibiting a vision of executive power that looked to be straight out of Yarvin’s playbook. The resemblance was no accident, according to the two people who have advised DOGE and are familiar with its leaders’ thinking. “It’s an open secret that everyone in policymaking roles has read Yarvin,” one of them said. “They were able to take the Curtis theory and use it to empower people on the ground to actually do stuff — even if they can’t admit it publicly.” Yarvin is not directly advising DOGE, but he is an intellectual beacon for the effort, and his writings have encouraged some of Musk’s lieutenants to view their efforts to slash billions from the federal budget as part of a grander ideological project, the people said. “It’s not like Marc Andreessen and [tech mogul and Trump cryptocurrency czar] David Sacks and Elon and JD and Trump are all sitting at the dinner table at Mar-a-Lago planning DOGE and in a lightbulb moment, they were like, ‘Let’s just instantiate the ideas of Curtis Yarvin,’” one person added. “It’s more like, Yarvin is the brain.” Emerson T. Brooking, an expert in online extremism at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, said Yarvin’s popularity among DOGE lieutenants shows the extent to which far-right Silicon Valley ideology has escaped the digital spaces in which it was incubated. “Yarvin escaped the fringe blogosphere because he wrapped deeply anti-American, totalitarian ideas in the language of U.S. start-up culture,” Brooking said. “And his writing is popular with DOGE employees today because they prefer to tell themselves that they are running a start-up, not dismantling a country.” Yet as Yarvin watched DOGE try to implement some of his theories, he increasingly sought to reject either praise or blame for the results. He said Musk’s efforts — which he described as simultaneously too aggressive and not aggressive enough — had strayed from his vision, hamstringing government agencies and alienating many federal employees (as well as the broader public) without delivering true transformation. “It’s big enough to be disruptive,” Yarvin said. “But there isn’t really this sort of sense of a deep, constructive purpose behind it.” He pointed to the administration’s handling of the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health, where funding freezes, widespread firings and alleged censorship of researchers has led to the departure of top scientists. While Yarvin is sharply critical of some parts of the federal government’s scientific agenda, he said it would be a better strategy to win the loyalty of skilled researchers by giving them more funding under a less onerous grant-writing process. The actions of Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE Service have been a focus of protests against the Trump administration, such as this one in Washington on April 5. Yarvin has accused DOGE of “really acting on a seat-of-the-pants basis.” (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post) “There’s nothing that’s gained by alienating scientists,” Yarvin said. “Instead of fighting against these people because they’re an enemy class who votes for the Democrats, you [should be] saying, ‘Oooh, we have cookies for you.’” The neo-reactionary dream Musk has said he will soon step back from DOGE, which may not retain the spotlight or the power it has held in recent months. But Yarvin extends a similar critique to the broader Trump administration. In a recent blog post he criticized the surprise detentions and deportations of foreign graduate students who expressed anti-Israel political views, saying that — “as a matter of objective, Machiavellian political science, without the slightest reference to whether it is good and/or evil” — the tactic would backfire. “The narrative has no flavor unless some kind of right-wing villain shows up,” Yarvin wrote. “And because we never learn, we always do.” Danielle Allen, a professor of political philosophy at Harvard University and democracy advocate, said it is hard to know what to make of Yarvin’s disavowals of Trump administration actions, in part because he is prone to inconsistent or contradictory statements.“It’s unclear to me that he’s a reliable witness to his own views,” Allen said in an interview. She believes there is “no question” that Yarvin’s work offers a blueprint for DOGE, and that any resulting problems should be chalked up to shortcomings in Yarvin’s theories, not their distortion in practice. One of the weaknesses of the autocratic style of government Yarvin has long advocated is that “ultimately it doesn’t function in the best interest of the people,” Allen said. “That’s what we’re watching,” she said. “And so if he’s complaining about that, that’s odd.” On a recent weeknight, Allen appeared alongside Yarvin at the Harvard Faculty Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a debate on the merits of democracy. The event was organized not by the university but by Passage Press, a boutique publishing house that publishes Yarvin’s books, as well as works by other reactionary authors. The mood on the platform was tense, but civil. Though a half dozen police officers milled inside and outside the club’s Georgian revival brick facade, only a few of the expected anti-Yarvin protesters showed up, and none disrupted the standing-room-only talk. Allen, while strongly denouncing Yarvin’s vision, acknowledged that America’s imperfect democracy needs renovating. Yarvin, for his part, allowed that there were “real kernels of corn” worth saving in what he described as the cathedral’s dung heap. After Allen left, Yarvin took up a position in the corner of the club’s warmly lit lounge to joust with a few left-wing critics as a small crowd gathered to watch. His challengers pressed him on DOGE, saying the initiative was clearly inspired by the “neo-reactionary” movement Yarvin founded. “I don’t see him thinking like me,” Yarvin said of Musk. “He’s fulfilling the neo-reactionary dream,” a young man in the front line of Yarvin’s critics said. “No, he’s not,” Yarvin said, a trace of exasperation in his voice. “My answer,” Yarvin added, “is, in a way: I wish.”",19471

For several decades, invasive species of Asian carp have steadily migrated and expanded from the Southeast northward through streams, rivers, and lakes in the Mississippi River and Midwest region.&nbsp; Asian carp, which can exceed 100 pounds in weight, spread rapidly by outcompeting native fish populations for food and space.&nbsp; They also reduce water quality.&nbsp; These invasive carp are nearing the entry point to the Great Lakes, which, if breached, would irreparably damage native fish species like walleye, yellow perch, and lake whitefish.&nbsp; This poses a significant risk to Great Lakes fishing, boating, recreation, and tourism, which support tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of commerce annually.&nbsp; The Brandon Road Interbasin Project near Joliet, Illinois, was authorized for construction in the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-260) and would provide multiple layers of innovative technological deterrents designed to prevent invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp;joint project involving the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) and the States of Illinois and Michigan. The Federal Government has provided $274 million for this project, has undertaken design work, has started site preparation, and is ready to begin construction of deterrent measures.&nbsp; In February 2025, however, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker decided to delay the State&#8217;s acquisition of property, which is necessary for construction to begin.&nbsp; Once Illinois acquires the land, it must also issue the Army Corps a State-level permit to begin construction. My Administration fully supports preventing the spread of invasive carp.&nbsp; The State of Illinois, where the Brandon Road Interbasin Project is located, must cease further delay in cooperating with this effort, for the sake of its own citizens and economy and for the sake of all of the Great Lakes States.&nbsp; I am directing my Administration to achieve maximum speed and efficiency at the Federal level.&nbsp; Specifically, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the Army, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall determine and expeditiously implement the most effective mechanisms, barriers, and other measures to prevent the migration and expansion of invasive carp in the Great Lakes Basin and the surrounding region.&nbsp; This includes supporting the Brandon Road Interbasin Project, through deadline-oriented investments of taxpayer dollars, to ensure the State of Illinois does not stand in the way of its construction.&nbsp; Specifically, for this project to remain on schedule so that it can effectively fulfill its purpose and constitute a worthy investment of taxpayer resources, the State of Illinois should acquire the necessary land to begin construction of the Brandon Road Interbasin Project by July 1, 2025, and the State of Illinois and any applicable localities should grant all permits or approvals required to facilitate Army Corps construction within 30 days of such permits or approvals becoming ripe for consideration by the State or locality and should streamline all permitting and environmental reviews to the maximum degree.&nbsp; Federal agency heads shall similarly streamline any permitting and environmental reviews and issue any requisite Federal permits or approvals as quickly as possible. Additionally, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall prioritize support for infrastructure projects to remove invasive carp from the Upper Illinois Waterway near Lake Michigan and for maintenance on existing infrastructure to block invasive carp from reaching and entering the Great Lakes Basin. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, through their joint operation of the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, shall prioritize support for research and management concerning the prevention, removal, and management of aquatic invasive species in the Great Lakes, including invasive carp.&nbsp; The Administrator of NOAA shall also prioritize this objective through the Great Lakes Aquatic Nuisance Species Information System and NOAA&#8217;s research and information-sharing work related to the growth and spread of aquatic invasive species. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Background . In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional ad valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with that unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and economy of the United States. Section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257 provided that &#8220;[s]hould any trading partner retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S. exports or other measures, I may further modify the [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States] to increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.&#8221; In Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People&#8217;s Republic of China), and Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment), pursuant to section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257, I ordered modifications of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to raise the applicable ad valorem duty rate for imports from the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) established in Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the fact that the State Council Tariff Commission of the PRC announced that it would retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14257 and Executive Order 14259. Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provided that, &#8220;[s]hould any trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters, I may further modify the HTSUS to decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under this order.&#8221; Since I signed Executive Order 14266, the United States has entered into discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security concerns. Conducting these discussions is a significant step by the PRC toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and addressing the concerns of the United States relating to economic and national security matters. Pursuant to section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the HTSUS to suspend for a period of 90 days application of the additional ad valorem duties imposed on the PRC listed in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, as amended by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, and clarified in the Presidential Memorandum of April 11, 2025 (Clarification of Exceptions Under Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as Amended), and to instead impose on articles of the PRC an additional ad valorem rate of duty as set forth herein, pursuant to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided in, Executive Order 14257, as modified by this order. Sec . 2 . Suspension of Country-Specific Ad Valorem Rate of Duty . Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025, all articles imported into the customs territory of the United States from the PRC, including Hong Kong and Macau, shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive Order 14257 and the Presidential Memorandum of April 11, 2025. This ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent reflects (i) the modification of the application of the additional ad valorem rate of duty on articles of China (including articles of Hong Kong and Macau) set forth in Executive Order 14257, by suspending 24 percentage points of that rate for an initial period of 90 days, and the retention of the remaining ad valorem rate of 10 percent on those articles pursuant to the terms of said order; and (ii) the removal of the modified additional ad valorem rates of duty on those articles imposed by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266. Sec . 3 . Tariff Modifications . In recognition of the intentions of the PRC to facilitate addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, the HTSUS shall be modified as follows: Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025: (a) heading 9903.01.25 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting the article description and by inserting &#8220;Articles the product of any country, except for products described in headings 9903.01.26–9903.01.33, and except as provided for in heading 9903.01.34, as provided for in subdivision (v) of U.S. note 2 to this subchapter . . . . . . &#8221; in lieu thereof; (b) heading 9903.01.63 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting &#8220;125%&#8221; each place that it appears and by inserting &#8220;34%&#8221; in lieu thereof; (c) subdivision (v)(xiii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting &#8220;125%&#8221;, and by inserting &#8220;34%&#8221; in lieu thereof; and (d) heading 9903.01.63 and subdivision (v)(xiii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS are hereby suspended for a period of 90 days beginning at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025. Sec . 4 . De Minimi s Tariff Decrease . To ensure that the reduction in duties pursuant to section 2 of this order is made fully effective and the purpose of Executive Order 14257, as amended, is not undermined, I also deem it necessary and appropriate to: (a) decrease the ad valorem rate of duty set forth in section 2(c)(i) of Executive Order 14256 of April 2, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports), as modified by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, from 120 percent to 54 percent; (b) retain in effect the per postal item containing goods duty of 100 dollars in section 2(c)(ii) of Executive Order 14256, as modified by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, that has been in effect since 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, unless and until otherwise modified by a subsequent executive action, notwithstanding the increase contemplated effective June 1, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14256, as modified by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266; and (c) modify the HTSUS, effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025, as follows: (i) subdivision (w) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting &#8220;120 percent&#8221;, and by inserting &#8220;54 percent&#8221; in lieu thereof; and (ii) subdivision (w) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting &#8220;, and before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025. For merchandise entered for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, the applicable specific duty rate is $200 per postal item containing such goods.&#8221; Sec . 5 .

Background . The United States faces a critical national security imperative to ensure a resilient, secure, and reliable energy supply for critical defense facilities designated under section 824o-1(c) of title 16, United States Code, and other mission capability resources. Advanced computing infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and other mission capability resources at military and national security installations and national laboratories demands reliable, high-density power sources that cannot be disrupted by external threats or grid failures. These facilities and resources&#8217; vulnerability to energy disruption represents a strategic risk that must be addressed. Advanced nuclear reactors include nuclear energy systems like Generation III+ reactors, small modular reactors, microreactors, and stationary and mobile reactors that have the potential to deliver resilient, secure, and reliable power to critical defense facilities and other mission capability resources. However, despite its promise, such technology has not been utilized in the United States at the scale or speed necessary to meet the Nation&#8217;s urgent national security requirements, while our adversaries are rapidly exporting and deploying such technology around the world. The Federal Government must utilize its full authority to accelerate the secure and responsible development, demonstration, deployment, and export of United States designed advanced nuclear technologies to bolster readiness and enhance American technological superiority. Additionally, the United States must further enhance our ability to export our nuclear technology to our allies and commercial partners, strengthening our shared ability to combat reliance on foreign adversaries through the use of safe, secure, and safeguarded nuclear technologies. Therefore, we must unleash the domestic nuclear industrial base and position American nuclear companies as the partners of choice for future energy growth throughout the world. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to: (a) ensure the rapid development, deployment, and use of advanced nuclear technologies to support national security objectives, such as the protection and operation of critical infrastructure, critical defense facilities, and other mission capability resources; (b) enable private sector investment, innovation, development, and use of advanced nuclear technologies in the United States, recognizing their benefit to national security, by aligning incentives across the Federal Government to fully leverage federally owned uranium and plutonium resources declared excess to defense needs, related nuclear material, supply chain components, and research and development infrastructure; and (c) coordinate regulatory efforts across the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, ensuring that these agencies optimize resources and risk allocation in accordance with their respective missions sets. Sec . 3 . Deployment and Use of Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies at Military Installations . (a) The Secretary of Defense, through the Secretary of the Army, shall establish a program of record for the utilization of nuclear energy for both installation energy and operational energy. The Secretary of Defense, through the Secretary of the Army, shall commence the operation of a nuclear reactor, regulated by the United States Army, at a domestic military base or installation no later than September 30, 2028. The Secretary of Defense shall designate the Secretary of the Army as the executive agent for both installation and operational nuclear energy across the Department of Defense. (b) The Secretary of Energy shall provide technical advice, as requested, to the Secretary of Defense on the design, construction, and operation of any advanced nuclear reactor on a military installation pursuant to this order. (c) The Secretary of State shall provide advice to the Secretary of Defense on any international legal requirements, or any necessary modification to international agreements or arrangements, relevant to this order. (d) Within 240 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Secretaries of the military departments, prepare and submit to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs recommendations for legislative proposals and regulatory actions regarding the distribution, operation, replacement, and removal of advanced nuclear reactors and spent nuclear fuel on military installations. Sec . 4 . Deployment and Use of Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies at Department of Energy Facilities . (a) The Secretary of Energy shall initiate the process for designating AI data centers within the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, in whole or in part, that are located at or operated in coordination with Department of Energy facilities, including as support for national security missions, as critical defense facilities, where appropriate. The electrical infrastructure, including both nuclear and non-nuclear power generation infrastructure, needed to operate such shall be considered defense critical electric infrastructure, for purposes of this order and subsequently across all applicable statutes, regulations, and directives or other non-regulatory statements of policy, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy shall designate one or more sites owned or controlled by the Department of Energy within the United States, including national laboratories, for the use and deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. (c) The Secretary of Energy shall utilize all available legal authorities to site, approve, and authorize the design, construction, and operation of privately funded advanced nuclear reactor technologies at Department of Energy-owned or controlled sites for the purpose of powering AI infrastructure, other critical or national security needs, supply chain items, or on-site infrastructure. The Secretary of Energy shall prioritize early site preparation and authorization activities with a goal of operating an advanced nuclear reactor at the first site no later than 30 months from the date of this order. Sec . 5 . Uranium and Related Materials for Reactors Referenced in this Order . (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy shall identify all useful uranium and plutonium material within the Department of Energy&#8217;s inventories that may be recycled or processed into nuclear fuel for reactors in the United States. (b) The Secretary of Energy shall release into a readily available fuel bank not less than 20 metric tons of high assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for any project from the private sector which receives authorization to construct and operate at a Department of Energy-owned or controlled site and that is regulated by the Department of Energy for the purpose of powering AI and other infrastructure. The Secretary of Energy shall retain such stockpiles of fuel as are necessary for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons as well as other existing national security obligations and therefore draw from other caches of Department of Energy-owned material to provide HALEU for the fuel bank pursuant to this section. To the extent feasible, the Secretary of Energy shall implement plans to ensure that a long-term supply of enriched uranium is available for the continued operation of the projects referenced in this first sentence of this subsection, including through the establishment of domestic fuel fabrication and supply chains to reduce reliance on foreign sources of fuel. (c) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy shall utilize all available legal authorities to site, approve, and authorize the design, construction, and operation of privately-funded nuclear fuel recycling, reprocessing, and reactor fuel fabrication technologies at identified sites controlled by their respective agencies for the purpose of fabricating fuel forms for use in national security reactors, commercial power reactors, and non-power research reactors. Sec . 6 . Interagency Coordination . The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy shall execute any useful contract or agreement under any of their respective authorities to support implementation of this order, including contracts or agreements for technical advisory support from the Department of Energy at Department of Defense installations for research, development, design, acquisition, specification, construction, inspection, installation, certification, testing, overhaul, refueling, operation, maintenance, supply support, and disposition of advanced nuclear reactor technologies in support of mission assurance objectives for critical infrastructure and to ensure military readiness and support from the Department of Defense to identify novel uses of advanced nuclear reactor technologies for defense applications and testing at Department of Energy-owned or controlled sites. Sec . 7 . National Environmental Policy Act Compliance . The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy shall consult with the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality regarding: (a) applying the Department of Defense&#8217;s and the Department of Energy&#8217;s established categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., for the construction of advanced nuclear reactor technologies on certain Federal sites within the United States and for any other appropriate measures for the purposes of implementing this order; (b) adopting other executive departments and agencies&#8217; (agencies) categorical exclusions for the same purposes; (c) establishing new categorical exclusions for the same purposes; (d) seeking to utilize other agencies&#8217; emergency and other permitting procedures for the siting and construction of advanced nuclear reactor technologies; and (e) developing alternative arrangements for compliance with NEPA in emergency situations as appropriate for the same purposes.

Purpose . Abundant energy is a vital national- and economic-security interest. In conjunction with domestic fossil fuel production, nuclear energy can liberate America from dependence on geopolitical rivals. It can power not only traditional manufacturing industries but also cutting-edge, energy-intensive industries such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Between 1954 and 1978, the United States authorized the construction of 133 since-completed civilian nuclear reactors at 81 power plants. Since 1978, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has authorized only a fraction of that number; of these, only two reactors have entered into commercial operation. The NRC charges applicants by the hour to process license applications, with prolonged timelines that maximize fees while throttling nuclear power development. The NRC has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever. This failure stems from a fundamental error: Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion. The NRC utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount of exposure. Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occurring levels. A myopic policy of minimizing even trivial risks ignores the reality that substitute forms of energy production also carry risk, such as pollution with potentially deleterious health effects. Recent events in Europe, such as the nationwide blackouts in Spain and Portugal, underscore the importance of my Administration&#8217;s focus on dispatchable power generation &#8211;including nuclear power &#8212; over intermittent power. Beginning today, my Administration will reform the NRC, including its structure, personnel, regulations, and basic operations. In so doing, we will produce lasting American dominance in the global nuclear energy market, create tens of thousands of high-paying jobs, and generate American-led prosperity and resilience. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to: (a) Reestablish the United States as the global leader in nuclear energy; (b) Facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry; (c) Facilitate the expansion of American nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050; (d) Employ emerging technologies to safely accelerate the modeling, simulation, testing, and approval of new reactor designs; (e) Support the continued operation of, and facilitate appropriate operational extensions for, the current nuclear fleet, as well as the reactivation of prematurely shuttered or partially completed nuclear facilities; and (f) Maintain the United States&#8217; leading reputation for nuclear safety. Sec . 3 . Reforming the NRC&#8217;s Culture . The Congress has mandated that the NRC&#8217;s &#8220;licensing and regulation of the civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy be conducted in a manner that is efficient and does not unnecessarily limit &#8212; (1) the civilian use of radioactive materials and deployment of nuclear energy; or (2) the benefits of civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy technology to society.&#8221; Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024, Public Law 118-67, sec. 501(a). Just as the Congress directed, the NRC&#8217;s mission shall include facilitating nuclear power while ensuring reactor safety. When carrying out its licensing and related regulatory functions, the NRC shall consider the benefits of increased availability of, and innovation in, nuclear power to our economic and national security in addition to safety, health, and environmental considerations. Sec . 4 . Reforming the NRC&#8217;s Structure . (a) The current structure and staffing of the NRC are misaligned with the Congress&#8217;s directive that the NRC shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power. The NRC shall, in consultation with the NRC&#8217;s DOGE Team (as defined in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and Implementing the President&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221;)), and consistent with its governing statutes, reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology. The NRC shall undertake reductions in force in conjunction with this reorganization, though certain functions may increase in size consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to new reactor licensing. The NRC shall also create a dedicated team of at least 20 officials to draft the new regulations directed by section 5 of this order. (b) The personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) shall be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill ACRS&#8217;s statutory obligations. Review by ACRS of permitting and licensing issues shall focus on issues that are truly novel or noteworthy. Sec . 5 . Reforming and Modernizing the NRC&#8217;s Regulations . The NRC, working with its DOGE Team, the Office of Management and Budget, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall undertake a review and wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents, and issue notice(s) of proposed rulemaking effecting this revision within 9 months of the date of this order. The NRC shall issue final rules and guidance to conclude this revision process within 18 months of the date of this order. In conducting this wholesale revision, the NRC shall be guided by the policies set forth in section 2 of this order and shall in particular: (a) Establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of licenses, license amendments, license renewals, certificates of compliance, power uprates, license transfers, and any other activity requested by a licensee or potential licensee, as directed under the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, rather than the nonbinding &#8220;generic milestone schedules&#8221; guidelines the NRC has already adopted. Those deadlines shall be enforced by fixed caps on the NRC&#8217;s recovery of hourly fees. The deadlines shall include: (1) a deadline of no more than 18 months for final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process, and (2) a deadline of no more than 1 year for final decision on an application to continue operating an existing reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process. The regulations should not provide for tolling those deadlines except in instances of applicant failure, and must allow a reasonably diligent applicant to navigate the licensing process successfully in the time allotted. Moreover, these are maximum time periods; the NRC shall adopt shorter deadlines tailored to particular reactor types or licensing pathways as appropriate. (b) Adopt science-based radiation limits. In particular, the NRC shall reconsider reliance on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation exposure and the &#8220;as low as reasonably achievable&#8221; standard, which is predicated on LNT. Those models are flawed, as discussed in section 1 of this order. In reconsidering those limits, the NRC shall specifically consider adopting determinate radiation limits, and in doing so shall consult with the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Environmental Protection Agency. (c) Revise, in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality, NRC regulations governing NRC&#8217;s compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act to reflect the Congress&#8217;s 2023 amendments to that statute and the policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of Executive Order 14154 of January 20, 2025 (Unleashing American Energy). (d) Establish an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that the DOD or the DOE have tested and that have demonstrated the ability to function safely. NRC review of such designs shall focus solely on risks that may arise from new applications permitted by NRC licensure, rather than revisiting risks that have already been addressed in the DOE or DOD processes. (e) Establish a process for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors, including by allowing for standardized applications and approvals and by considering to what extent such reactors or components thereof should be regulated through general licenses. (f) Establish stringent thresholds for circumstances in which the NRC may demand changes to reactor design once construction is underway. (g) Revise the Reactor Oversight Process and reactor security rules and requirements to reduce unnecessary burdens and be responsive to credible risks. (h) Adopt revised and, where feasible, determinate and data-backed thresholds to ensure that reactor safety assessments focus on credible, realistic risks. (i) Reconsider the regulations governing the time period for which a renewed license remains effective, and extend that period as appropriate based on available technological and safety data. (j) Streamline the public hearings process. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall provide funding for publication of this order in the Federal Register . DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 23, 2025.

REFORMING NUCLEAR REACTOR TESTING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY,EXECUTIVE ORDER,23/05/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/reforming-nuclear-reactor-testing-at-the-department-of-energy/,"Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J.

Purpose . The United States led the development of civilian nuclear power through the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Reactor Testing Station (now known as Idaho National Laboratory), and several other Federal Government entities. This work produced safe and abundant energy. But in the decades since, commercial deployment of new nuclear technologies has all but stopped. The Idaho National Laboratory has principal responsibility for constructing and testing new reactor designs; it concluded construction of new reactors in the 1970s. Our proud history of innovation has succumbed to overregulated complacency. As I stated in Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), the United States needs a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive development of advanced technologies, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain modern life and national security. Nuclear energy both is vital to this effort and has never held so much promise. Decades of research and engineering have produced prototypes of advanced nuclear technologies that incorporate passive safety mechanisms, improve the physical architecture of reactor designs, increase reactor operational flexibility and performance, and reduce risk in fuel disposal. Advanced reactors &#8212; including microreactors, small modular reactors, and Generation IV and Generation III+ reactors &#8212; have revolutionary potential. They will open a range of new applications to support data centers, microchip manufacturing, petrochemical production, healthcare, desalination, hydrogen production, and other industries. The United States cultivated the effort to design and build the first Generation IV reactor for commercial use, but the Federal Government has effectively throttled the domestic deployment of advanced reactors, ceding the initiative to foreign nations in building this critical technology. That changes today. It is the policy of my Administration to foster nuclear innovation and bring advanced nuclear technologies into domestic production as soon as possible. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For purposes of this order: (a) The term &#8220;advanced reactor&#8221; has the same meaning as the term &#8220;advanced nuclear reactor&#8221; in 42 U.S.C. 16271(b)(1). (b) The term &#8220;Department&#8221; means the Department of Energy. (c) The term &#8220;qualified test reactor&#8221; means an advanced reactor that satisfies thresholds established by the Department sufficient to demonstrate that, from the perspective of technical development and financial backing, the reactor may feasibly be operational within 2 years from the date a substantially complete application is submitted. (d) The term &#8220;Secretary&#8221; means the Secretary of Energy. Sec . 3 . Findings . With some rare and arguable exceptions, no advanced reactors have yet been deployed in America. I find that design, construction, operation, and disposition of such reactors under the auspices of the Department &#8212; and not to produce commercial electric power &#8212; would be for research purposes, rather than &#8220;for the purpose of demonstrating the suitability for commercial application of . . . a reactor&#8221; within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 5842. The purpose of testing these reactors at this stage in America&#8217;s industrial evolution is to establish fundamental technological viability. Thus, at least for the foreseeable future, advanced reactors over which the Department exercises sufficient control and that do not produce commercial electric power, including those &#8220;under contract with and for the account of the [Department],&#8221; 42 U.S.C. 2140(a)(2), fall within the jurisdiction of the Department, which has authority to foster research and development in nuclear reactors. Nothing in this section alters the authority or jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. Sec . 4 . Reforming the National Laboratory Process for Reactor Testing . (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance regarding what counts as a qualified test reactor for purposes of this order. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to revise the regulations, guidance, and procedures and practices of the Department, the National Laboratories, and any other entity under the Department&#8217;s jurisdiction to significantly expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors under the Department&#8217;s jurisdiction. The Secretary shall ensure that the Department&#8217;s expedited procedures enable qualified test reactors to be safely operational at Department-owned or Department-controlled facilities within 2 years following the submission of a substantially complete application. (c) Upon finding that an applicant has submitted a substantially complete application for a qualified test reactor, the Secretary shall establish a team consisting of representatives from the Secretary&#8217;s office, the relevant National Laboratory or Laboratories, the Department&#8217;s Office of General Counsel, and any other entities within the Department that possess the authority to deconflict, oppose, or approve the application. The team shall provide assistance to the applicant to ensure expeditious processing of its application. For these purposes, each member shall report directly to the Secretary. (d) The Secretary shall prioritize qualified test reactor projects for processing, as consistent with applicable law. Sec . 5 . Establishing a Pilot Program Outside the National Laboratories . (a) The Secretary shall create a pilot program for reactor construction and operation outside the National Laboratories, pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act&#8217;s authorization of reactors under the Department&#8217;s sufficient control, including reactors &#8220;under contract with and for the account of&#8221; the Department, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2140. The Secretary shall approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the goal of achieving criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4, 2026. (b) Upon approval of an application for this pilot program, the Secretary shall assign a team to provide assistance to the applicant as specified in subsection 4(c) of this order. Sec . 6 . Streamlining Environmental Reviews . (a) The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, take action to reform the Department&#8217;s rules governing compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) no later than June 30, 2025, consistent with the policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of Executive Order 14154 of January 20, 2025 (Unleashing American Energy), and with applicable law. (b) The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite the Department&#8217;s environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant. In addition to the measures outlined in section 7 of the Executive Order of May 23, 2025 (Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security), such measures shall include determining which Department functions are not subject to NEPA, creating categorical exclusions as appropriate for reactors within certain parameters (or relying on existing categorical exclusions), relying on supplemental analyses where reactors will be located on existing sites, or utilizing alternative procedures under NEPA. Sec . 7 . Implementation . The Secretary shall work with the DOGE Team Lead at the Department, as defined in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and Implementing the President&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221;), with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to implement this order. Sec . 8 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Department of Energy shall provide funding for publication of this order in the Federal Register . DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 23, 2025.

Policy and Purpose . Over the last 5 years, confidence that scientists act in the best interests of the public has fallen significantly. A majority of researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics believe science is facing a reproducibility crisis. The falsification of data by leading researchers has led to high-profile retractions of federally funded research. Unfortunately, the Federal Government has contributed to this loss of trust. In several notable cases, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have used or promoted scientific information in a highly misleading manner. For example, under the prior Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued COVID-19 guidance on reopening schools that incorporated edits by the American Federation of Teachers and was understood to discourage in-person learning. This guidance&#8217;s restrictive and burdensome reopening conditions led many schools to remain at least partially closed, resulting in substantial negative effects on educational outcomes &#8212; even though the best available scientific evidence showed that children were unlikely to transmit or suffer serious illness or death from the virus, and that opening schools with reasonable mitigation measures would have only minor effects on transmission. The National Marine Fisheries Service justified a biological opinion by adopting an admitted &#8220;worst-case scenario&#8221; projection of the North Atlantic right whale population that it believed was &#8220;very likely&#8221; wrong. The agency&#8217;s proposed actions could have destroyed the historic Maine lobster fishery. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently overturned that opinion because the agency&#8217;s decision to seek out the worst-case scenario skewed its approach to the evidence. Similarly, agencies have used Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario 8.5 to assess the potential effects of climate change in a &#8220;higher&#8221; warming scenario. RCP 8.5 is a worst-case scenario based on highly unlikely assumptions like end-of-century coal use exceeding estimates of recoverable coal reserves. Scientists have warned that presenting RCP 8.5 as a likely outcome is misleading. Actions taken by the prior Administration further politicized science, for example, by encouraging agencies to incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations into all aspects of science planning, execution, and communication. Scientific integrity in the production and use of science by the Federal Government is critical to maintaining the trust of the American people and ensuring confidence in government decisions informed by science. My Administration is committed to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and impactful, and that Federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available. We must restore the American people&#8217;s faith in the scientific enterprise and institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of the public good. Reproducibility, rigor, and unbiased peer review must be maintained. This order restores the scientific integrity policies of my first Administration and ensures that agencies practice data transparency, acknowledge relevant scientific uncertainties, are transparent about the assumptions and likelihood of scenarios used, approach scientific findings objectively, and communicate scientific data accurately. Agency use of Gold Standard Science, as set forth in this order, will spur innovation, translate discovery to success, and ensure continued American strength and global leadership in technology. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) &#8220;Employee&#8221; has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105. (b) &#8220;Scientific information&#8221; means factual inputs, data, models, analyses, technical information, or scientific assessments related to such disciplines as the behavioral and social sciences, public health and medical sciences, life and earth sciences, engineering, physical sciences, or probability and statistics. This includes any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. (c) &#8220;Scientific misconduct&#8221; means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, reviewing, or reporting the results of scientific research, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion. For the purposes of this definition; (i) &#8220;fabrication&#8221; is making up data or results and recording or reporting them; (ii) &#8220;falsification&#8221; is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record; and (iii) &#8220;plagiarism&#8221; is the appropriation of another person&#8217;s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. (d) &#8220;Senior appointee&#8221; means an individual appointed by the President (or an individual performing the functions and duties of an individual appointed by the President) or a non-career member of the Senior Executive Service. (e) &#8220;Weight of scientific evidence&#8221; means an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation. Quality and relevance determinations, at a minimum, should include consideration of study design, fitness for purpose, replicability, peer review, and transparency and reliability of data. Sec . 3 . Restoring Gold Standard Science . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP Director) shall, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, issue guidance for agencies on implementation of &#8220;Gold Standard Science&#8221; in the conduct and management of their respective scientific activities. For the purposes of this order, Gold Standard Science means science conducted in a manner that is: (i) reproducible; (ii) transparent; (iii) communicative of error and uncertainty; (iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary; (v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions; (vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses; (vii) subject to unbiased peer review; (viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and (ix) without conflicts of interest. (b) Upon publication of the guidance prescribed in subsection (a), each agency head, as necessary and appropriate and in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) and the OSTP Director, shall promptly update applicable agency policies governing the production and use of scientific information, including scientific integrity policies, to implement the OSTP Director&#8217;s guidance on Gold Standard Science and ensure that agency scientific activities are conducted in accordance with this order. (c) Each agency head shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate the OSTP Director&#8217;s guidance on Gold Standard Science and the requirements of this order into the processes by which their agency conducts, manages, interprets, communicates, and uses scientific or technological information prior to the finalization of the updated policies under this section. (d) Within 60 days of the publication of the guidance prescribed in section 3(a), agency heads shall report to the OSTP Director on the actions taken to implement Gold Standard Science at their agency. Sec . 4 . Improving the Use, Interpretation, and Communication of Scientific Data . No later than 30 days after the date of this order, agency heads and employees shall adhere to the following rules governing the use, interpretation, and communication of scientific data, unless otherwise provided by law: (a) Employees shall not engage in scientific misconduct nor knowingly rely on information resulting from scientific misconduct. (b) Except as prohibited by law, and consistent with relevant policies that protect national security or sensitive personal or confidential business information, agency heads shall in a timely manner and, to the extent practicable and within the agency&#8217;s authority: (i) subject to paragraph (ii), make publicly available the following information within the agency&#8217;s possession: (A) the data, analyses, and conclusions associated with scientific and technological information produced or used by the agency that the agency reasonably assesses will have a clear and substantial effect on important public policies or important private sector decisions (influential scientific information), including data cited in peer-reviewed literature; and (B) the models and analyses (including, as applicable, the source code for such models) the agency used to generate such influential scientific information. Employees may not invoke exemption 5 to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) to prevent disclosure of such models unless authorized in writing to do so by the agency head following prior notice to the OSTP Director. (ii) risk models used to guide agency enforcement actions or select enforcement targets are not information that must be disclosed under this subsection. (c) When using scientific information in agency decision-making, employees shall transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties, including how uncertainty propagates throughout any models used in the analysis. (d) Where employees produce or use scientific information to inform policy or legal determinations they must use science that comports with the legal standards applicable to those determinations, including when agencies evaluate the realistic or reasonably foreseeable effects of an action. (e) Employees shall be transparent about the likelihood of the assumptions and scenarios used. Highly unlikely and overly precautionary assumptions and scenarios should only be relied upon in agency decision-making where required by law or otherwise pertinent to the agency&#8217;s action. (f) When scientific or technological information is used to inform agency evaluations and subsequent decision-making, employees shall apply a &#8220;weight of scientific evidence&#8221; approach. (g) Employees&#8217; communication of scientific information shall be consistent with the results of the relevant analysis and evaluation and, to the extent that uncertainty is present, the degree of uncertainty should be communicated. Communications involving a scientific model or information derived from a scientific model should include reference to any material assumptions that inform the model&#8217;s outputs. (h) Once the guidance on Gold Standard Science is established and promulgated pursuant to section 3 of this order, it shall, among other things, form the basis for employees’ evaluation of all scientific and technological information called for in this order except where otherwise required by law. Sec . 5 . Interim Scientific Integrity Policies .

For decades, the USBP has maintained the thin line between order and chaos.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the last administration &#8212; in an extraordinary act of deception and betrayal, imported an army of unvetted illegal aliens, including violent criminals, thugs, gang members, and terrorists from the darkest and most dangerous parts of the world.&nbsp; Their arrival over the last 4 years ushered in record-shattering levels of immigrants illegally coming into our country while at the same time depleting resources and draining the morale of our incredible USBP agents. The tide turned on January 20, 2025.&nbsp; One of my first actions as President was declaring a National Emergency at the southern border of the United States, which provided additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government&#8217;s response to the crisis.&nbsp; I also designated cartels and other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua and MS-13, as foreign terrorist organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists in order to end their campaign of violence and bloodshed on our homeland.&nbsp; Additionally, I have resumed our border wall construction, reinstated the Remain in Mexico policy, halted the practice of catch-and-release, ended asylum for illegal border crossers, deployed thousands of American soldiers to defend and protect our borders, and implemented the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Within my first 100 days in office, daily border encounters dropped 95 percent, and migrant crossings declined by an astounding 99.99 percent.&nbsp; In March, our Nation saw the lowest monthly number of border encounters in recorded history &#8212; and fentanyl traffic fell by 54 percent compared to March of the previous year.&nbsp; Also in my first 100 days, my Administration arrested more than 150,000 and deported more than 135,000 illegal aliens.&nbsp; Under my leadership, our USBP agents are not only receiving the resources they need to do their job but also the respect they have earned and deserve &#8212; and our work is only just beginning. As we celebrate 101 years of the USBP, we honor the thousands of patriots who dedicate their careers to defending our borders and upholding the rule of law, even in the face of grave danger and tremendous risk.&nbsp; Above all, we pay tribute to every brave soul who has perished in the line of duty while proudly serving our Nation.&nbsp; In their memory, and in honor of their beloved family members, we pledge to empower the USBP to safeguard the American homeland today, tomorrow, and beyond. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 28, 2025, as a day in celebration of the 101st Anniversary of the United States Border Patrol.

Palantir and Fannie Mae are teaming up for an effort to uncover mortgage fraud. Fannie says the partnership will deploy Palantir's AI tools to detect suspicious activity. Shares of both Palantir and Fannie Mae have rallied sharply since Trump's election win. Palantir and Fannie Mae , two firms that have been at the heart of the Trump trade , are teaming up for a push to root out fraud in the mortgage market. The government-sponsored mortgage finance giant announced on Wednesday that it would use artificial intelligence tools developed by Palantir in its newly created Crime Detection Unit. ""This foundation will power Fannie Mae's Crime Detection Unit , a new platform that the company believes will help detect and prevent mortgage fraud with speed and precision never before seen in the U.S. housing market,"" Fannie said in a statement . ""This partnership with Fannie Mae will set off a revolution in how we combat mortgage fraud in this country. We are bringing the fight directly to anyone who attempts to defraud our mortgage system and exploit hardworking Americans,"" Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir, said. The team-up is the latest win for Palantir, which has been inking more contracts with the federal government since Trump entered the White House. The AI software company is reportedly helping the Internal Revenue Service with a huge data project, Wired wrote in April. The tech firm is also working with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement on a visa-tracking program, with ICE paying $30 million for the company's software tools. Palantir stock is up 62% year-to-date and has gained almost 150% since the November election. Meanwhile, shares of Fannie Mae have soared on the possibility that the Trump administration will release it and fellow mortgage giant Freddie Mac from government control.

CNBC His warning came in response to questions about a GOP proposal to block states from regulating artificial intelligence for 10 years – which has taken heat from other leaders in the tech industry. &#8220;A 10-year moratorium is far too blunt an instrument. AI is advancing too head-spinningly fast,&#8221; Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times. &#8220;Without a clear plan for a federal response, a moratorium would give us the worst of both worlds &#8212; no ability for states to act, and no national policy as a backstop.&#8221; Explore More Taylor Swift unseated as world&#039;s youngest self-made female billionaire &#8212; by a hard-partying, 30-year-old college dropout JPMorgan threatens to fire job-hopping junior bankers as battle for Wall Street talent heats up Stalled ‘beautiful’ bill drains nation’s rainy-day fund — and things could soon turn ugly for US households Karp, whose software firm boasts partners like Microsoft, Oracle, Deloitte and PwC, argued that the US currently has the lead in the race thanks to its flourishing tech industry. “There is no economy in the world with this kind of corporate leadership which is willing to pivot, which understands technologies, which is willing to look at new things, but also has deep domain expertise,” he said.&nbsp; “Our allies in the West, in Europe, are going to have to learn from us. Our allies in the Middle East are learning quicker from us. Our adversaries are trying to learn from us,” he continued. 3 Karp argued that the US currently has the lead in the race thanks to its flourishing tech industry. Getty Images Karp has long pushed for the US to prioritize gaining dominance in artificial intelligence over foreign nations, arguing that it requires an “all-country effort.” In a recent letter to shareholders, Karp also made clear Palantir’s commitment to enhancing US defense interests. He hit back, however, against a New York Times report that Palantir is helping the Trump administration gather data on Americans – telling CNBC that the company is “not surveilling Americans.” Shares of the $306 billion AI firm outperformed last year and have continued to climb, soaring more than 60% so far this year. 3 Karp has long pushed for the US to prioritize gaining dominance in artificial intelligence over foreign nations AFP via Getty Images The stock fell about 6% on Thursday.

Palantir is the second-best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 in 2025. Shares are up 74% year-to-date, trouncing the broader index as well as other tech stalwarts. Government deals, AI hype, and retail bullishness are factors that have lifted shares this year. Palantir stock is crushing the broader market and it's not even close. Shares of the AI-powered software company are up 74% year-to-date, trading around $132 on Thursday. That performance handily trounces the S&amp;P 500's gain of about 1.6%, but it's also vastly better than other tech titans like Nvidia (+5.6% YTD), Microsoft (+11% YTD), and Apple (-19% YTD). Here's what's behind the stellar performance of the stock in 2025. 1. Government dealmaking Palantir has inked a number of contracts with the Federal government this year, signing on to initiatives supporting the Trump administration's policy priorities. In April, the software company secured a $30 million deal with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for software to monitor visas and track deportations. In May, the firm teamed up with Fannie Mae , and said it would provide AI tools to support the government-sponsored mortgage financier's Crime Detection Unit. It also secured a $795 million contract with the Department of Defense's AI arm, adding to a prior $480 million contract it secured with the agency last year. The contract lasts through 2029. ""We continue to believe that PLTR will continue to gain more deals across the federal government with its software value proposition playing perfectly into the broader efficiency theme,"" analysts at Wedbush Securities wrote in a note last month, calling the stock one of the ""top names to own."" The ties to the Trump administration and its flurry of government dealmaking recently have put it among the winners of the Trump trade. 2. The AI trade Palantir, with its artificial intelligence-powered data software, is viewed as a key part of Wall Street's booming AI trade . Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know During the first quarter , Palantir reported a total of $883.9 million in revenue, up 39% year-over-year. That was largely attributable to hot demand for the company's Artificial Intelligence Platform, analysts at Wedbush wrote in a note last month. ""We view Palantir as a generational tech name that we see as a trillion market cap over the next three years with PLTR being a core name in the AI Revolution theme over the coming years,"" Wedbush said. CEO Alex Karp has touted the ""rule of 40"" as a key metric of the firm's success. The rule says software makers should be considered at the top of their game when revenue growth plus profit margins are equal to at least 40%. Karp bragged that Palantir's score was 83% in the company's first quarter earnings report. ""We are in the middle of a tectonic shift in the adoption of our software, particularly in the US where our revenue soared 55% year-over-year, while our US commercial revenue expanded 71% year-over-year in the first quarter to surpass a one-billion-dollar annual run rate,"" Karp said. 3. An army of retail investors Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Retail traders love Alex Karp , praising the Palantir chief for his outspoken nature and meme-able public appearances. Karp has also shown interest in developing a connection with his retail followers. On earnings calls, the top Palantir exec regularly answers questions from retail investors before addressing big bank analysts. Palantir landed among the top 9 most trending stocks on r/ WallStreetBets over the last month, according to Vanda Research, a firm that tracks retail investor activity and sentiment. Retail traders also poured in a net $170.3 million into the stock in the last five days, the firm said on Thursday, making it the second-most purchased stock among individual investors after Tesla. ""Palantir is a recurring meme stock,"" Vanda Research said. ""Retail traders are bullish on government contracts and AI potential, with high conviction among holders.""

Palantir Is Going on Defense,Wired,2025-06-05,https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-defense-conference-journalists,"Palantir Is Going on Defense | WIRED Skip to main content Open Navigation Menu Menu Palantir Is Going on Defense Security Politics The Big Story Business Science Culture Reviews More Chevron Search Search Security Politics The Big Story Business Science Culture Reviews Newsletters Podcasts Video The Big Interview Magazine Merch Travel Steven Levy&#x27;s Plaintext Column Events WIRED Insider WIRED Consulting Coupons Caroline Haskins Business Jun 5, 2025 3:22 PM Palantir Is Going on Defense Palantir threatened to call police on a WIRED reporter and kicked out other journalists from a recent conference following reports of the data analytics firm’s work with the Trump administration. Palantir headquarters in Palo Alto, California. Photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images Save this story Save Save this story Save Palantir, facing mounting public scrutiny for its work with the Trump administration, took an increasingly defensive stance toward journalists and perceived critics this week, both at a defense conference in Washington, DC, and on social media. On Tuesday, a Palantir employee threatened to call the police on a WIRED journalist who was watching software demonstrations at its booth at AI+ Expo. The conference, which is hosted by the Special Competitive Studies Project, a think tank founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is free and open to the public, including journalists. Later that day, Palantir had conference security remove at least three other journalists—Jack Poulson, writer of the All-Source Intelligence Substack; Max Blumenthal, who writes and publishes The Grayzone; and Jessica Le Masurier, a reporter at France 24—from the conference hall, Poulson says. The reporters were later able to reenter the hall, Poulson adds. The move came after Palantir spokespeople began publicly condemning a recent New York Times report titled “Trump Taps Palantir to Compile Data on Americans” published on May 30. WIRED previously reported that Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was building a master database to surveil and track immigrants. WIRED has also reported that the company was helping DOGE with an IRS data project, collaborating to build a “mega-API.” The public criticism from Palantir is unusual, as the company does not typically issue statements pushing back on individual news stories. Prior to being kicked out of Palantir’s booth, the WIRED journalist, who is also the author of this article, was taking photos, videos, and written notes during software demos of Palantir FedStart partners, which use the company’s cloud systems to get certified for government work. The booth’s walls had phrases like “REAWAKEN THE GIANT” and “DON’T GIVE UP THE SHIP!” printed on the outside. When the reporter briefly stepped away from the booth and attempted to re-enter, she was stopped by Eliano Younes, Palantir’s head of strategic engagement, who said that WIRED was not allowed to be there. The reporter asked why, and Younes repeated himself, adding that if WIRED tried to return, he would call the police. After the conference ended, Younes responded to a photo from the conference that the reporter posted on X . “hey caroline, great seeing you at the expo yesterday,” he wrote. “can&#x27;t wait to read your coverage of the event.” Palantir did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what&#x27;s happening? We&#x27;d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at 785-813-1084. Poulson tells WIRED that he, Blumenthal, and Le Masurier were also watching demos at Palantir’s booth prior to being kicked out. After a Tuesday panel with Younes and Palantir engineer Ryan Fox, Poulson says Le Masurier approached Younes near Palantir’s booth and asked about the company’s work for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement . A Palantir employee stepped between them and claimed that Palantir had asked her to leave “multiple times,” according to a video of the interaction viewed by WIRED, and she was escorted out of the conference hall shortly after. “Apparently, Palantir was so annoyed that they not only kicked her out, but demanded that Max and I be kicked out as well,” Poulson says. “So the security guards came and got us.” The group was allowed back inside the conference hall after explaining their situation to friendly security guards, Poulson says. The guards asked them to respect any requests from attendees to stop filming. Some conference organizers appeared to be on high alert after a pro-Palestine demonstrator interrupted a panel with Palantir’s head of defense, Mike Gallagher, on Monday. The demonstrator was subsequently ejected from the conference, Poulson reported . A handful of pro-Palestine activists were also thrown out on Tuesday after disrupting a panel with Eric Schmidt and Thom Shanker, a former Pentagon reporter at the The New York Times. (Palantir formed a partnership with the Israeli military in January 2024, and Google is part of a $1.2 billion cloud contract with the Israeli government.) Poulson tells WIRED that on Wednesday, the conference began mandatory bag-checks at at least one talk. During Younes’ Tuesday panel with fellow Palantir employee Fox, which was focused on what the two men do at Palantir and why they like working there, Younes made passing references to perceived critics of the company. When talking about the reasons he joined Palantir, he said, “I was sick and tired of people with bad intentions,” Younes said, “many of them who are actually here.” He later added that he’s a “big believer” in the views of Palantir’s cofounders, particularly those of CEO Alex Karp. (Karp is known for his nonapologetic stance toward Palantir’s work with military and defense agencies and immigration authorities.) “Playing a role in helping them, to prove the doubters and the haters wrong, that just feels really good,” Younes said. On Tuesday, Palantir posted on X claiming the Times article was “blatantly untrue” and said that the company “never collects data to unlawfully surveil Americans.” The Times article did not claim that Palantir buys or collects its own data, though it’s a common misconception that the company does so. The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment by WIRED. On Wednesday, Palantir’s official X account continued posting about the Times article on X. “Want to meet Dr. Karp?” the post read . “In 90 seconds, identify the technical errors in this article. DM us a video in the next 24 hours - whoever finds the most inaccuracies gets an interview with him.” Update 6/5/25 5:20 ET: Wired has clarified that there were mandatory bag checks at at least one talk.

Purpose . The United States stands at the threshold of a bold new chapter in aerospace innovation. For more than 50 years, outdated and overly restrictive regulations have grounded the promise of supersonic flight over land, stifling American ingenuity, weakening our global competitiveness, and ceding leadership to foreign adversaries. Advances in aerospace engineering, materials science, and noise reduction now make supersonic flight not just possible, but safe, sustainable, and commercially viable. This order begins a historic national effort to reestablish the United States as the undisputed leader in high-speed aviation. By updating obsolete standards and embracing the technologies of today and tomorrow, we will empower our engineers, entrepreneurs, and visionaries to deliver the next generation of air travel, which will be faster, quieter, safer, and more efficient than ever before. Sec . 2 . Regulatory Reform for Supersonic Flight . (a) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall take the necessary steps, including through rulemaking, to repeal the prohibition on overland supersonic flight in 14 CFR 91.817 within 180 days of the date of this order and establish an interim noise-based certification standard, making any modifications to 14 CFR 91.818 as necessary, as consistent with applicable law. The Administrator of the FAA shall also take immediate steps to repeal 14 CFR 91.819 and 91.821, which will remove additional regulatory barriers that hinder the advancement of supersonic aviation technology in the United States. (b) &nbsp;Within 18 months of the date of this order, the Administrator of the FAA shall issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to establish a standard for supersonic aircraft noise certification under 14 CFR Part 36 and amend 14 CFR 91.817. &nbsp;The proposed rule shall define acceptable noise thresholds for takeoff, landing, and en-route supersonic operation based on operational testing and research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) data as identified in subsection 3(a) of this order, and considering community acceptability, economic reasonableness, and technological feasibility. &nbsp;The proposed rule shall further specify a process for periodic review and update of the rule to reflect future advances in aircraft noise reduction technology. &nbsp;Any final rule in connection with the NPRM shall be issued within 24 months of the date of this order. Sec . 3 . Advancing Supersonic Research and Development . (a) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) shall, in consultation with the heads of relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), including the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, coordinate supersonic research and development through the National Science and Technology Council, with the goal of: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identifying RDT&amp;E needs for regulatory development, commercial viability, and operational integration of supersonic aircraft into the National Airspace System; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;coordinating federally funded RDT&amp;E and industry-led testing of supersonic technologies at Federal test sites; and (iii) &nbsp;collecting and sharing the results of such RDT&amp;E in a manner suitable for informing domestic regulatory development and international science and technology engagement on civil supersonic matters. (b) &nbsp;The Director of OSTP shall provide the results of the coordinated efforts in subsection (a) of this section to the Administrator of the FAA to inform the development of future procedures, regulations, and policies, including those related to the certification of civil supersonic aircraft and noise and environmental standards called for in this section 3. Sec . 4 . Promoting International Engagement on Civil Supersonic Flight Regulations . (a) The Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administrator of the FAA, and in consultation with the Director of OSTP and the heads of other agencies as considered appropriate by the Director of OSTP, shall engage the International Civil Aviation Organization and key foreign partners to seek global alignment regarding supersonic regulatory approaches. (b) &nbsp;The Administrator of the FAA, under the supervision of the Secretary of Transportation and in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall seek to secure bilateral aviation safety agreements with foreign aviation authorities as necessary for the safe international operation of supersonic aircraft. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Federal Aviation Administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

"Eliminating Waste, Fraud, and Abuse in Medicaid",MEMORANDUM,06/06/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/eliminating-waste-fraud-and-abuse-in-medicaid/,"Eliminating Waste, Fraud, and Abuse in Medicaid &#8211; The White House MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES SUBJECT: Eliminating Waste, Fraud, and Abuse in Medicaid My Administration has been relentlessly committed to rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in Government programs to preserve and protect them for those who rely most on them. The Medicaid program was designed to be a program to compassionately provide taxpayer dollars to healthcare providers who offer care to the most vulnerable Americans. To keep payments reasonable, billable costs for such care were historically capped at the same level that healthcare providers could receive from Medicare. The State and Federal Governments jointly shared this cost burden to ensure those of lesser means did not go untreated. Under the Biden Administration, States and healthcare providers were permitted to game the system. For example, States &quot;taxed&quot; healthcare providers, but sent the same money back to them in the form of a &quot;Medicaid payment,&quot; which automatically unlocked for healthcare providers an additional &quot;burden-sharing&quot; payment from the Federal Government. Through this gimmick, the State could avoid contributing money toward Medicaid services, meaning the State no longer had a reason to be prudent in the amount of reimbursement provided. Instead of paying Medicare rates, many States that utilize these arrangements now pay the same healthcare providers almost three times the Medicare amount, a practice encouraged by the Biden Administration. These State Directed Payments have rapidly accelerated, quadrupling in magnitude over the last 4 years and reaching $110 billion in 2024 alone. This trajectory threatens the Federal Treasury and Medicaid&#039;s long-term stability, and the imbalance between Medicaid and Medicare patients threatens to jeopardize access to care for our seniors. I pledged to protect and improve these important Government healthcare programs for those that rely on them. Seniors on Medicare and Medicaid recipients both deserve access to quality care in a system free from the fraud, waste, and abuse, that enriches the unscrupulous and jeopardizes the programs themselves. We will take action to continue to love and cherish the Medicare and Medicaid programs to ensure they are preserved for those who need them most. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall therefore take appropriate action to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid, including by ensuring Medicaid payments rates are not higher than Medicare, to the extent permitted by applicable law. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

To carry out this mission, the deployed military personnel may perform those military protective activities that the Secretary of Defense determines are reasonably necessary to ensure the protection and safety of Federal personnel and property &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense shall consult with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security prior to withdrawing any personnel from any location to which they are sent.&nbsp; The Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security may delegate to subordinate officials of their respective Departments any of the authorities conferred upon them by this memorandum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

My Administration is committed to protecting the American people from radical green agenda policies that make their lives more expensive, and to maximizing the beneficial uses of our existing energy infrastructure and natural resources to generate energy and lower the cost of living. The Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023 (Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin), for example, elevates &#8220;equitable treatment for fish&#8221; and misplaced concerns about climate change above the Nation&#8217;s interests in reliable energy resources and the needs of American citizens. Among other things, the actions that the Biden Administration contemplated in furtherance of the policy stated in the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023, included breaching four dams on the Lower Snake River, eliminating over 3,000 megawatts of secure, reliable, and affordable hydroelectric generating capacity. The negative impacts from these reckless acts, if completed, would be devastating for the region, and there would be no viable approach to replace the low-cost, baseload energy supplied; the critical shipping channels lost; the vital water supply for local farmers reduced; or the recreational opportunities that would no longer be possible as a result of these acts. To prevent these harmful impacts, I hereby revoke the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023. Further, within 15 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works under the direction of the Secretary of the Army (heads of departments) shall take all appropriate steps to withdraw from the Memorandum of Understanding filed on December 14, 2023, in the Columbia River System litigation, National Wildlife Federation v. National Marine Fisheries Service , 3:01-cv-640-SI (D. Or.), Dkt. 2450-1 (MOU). The heads of departments shall also rescind the &#8220;Notice of Intent to Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Columbia River System Operations&#8221; published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024. As appropriate, the heads of departments shall develop a schedule to complete the Supplemental Columbia River System Environmental Impact Statement and reissue the Notice of Intent pursuant to that schedule and in alignment with any updated National Environmental Policy Act procedures of the heads of departments. The heads of departments shall submit the schedule to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Chair shall convene regular meetings among the heads of departments and any additional appropriate Federal stakeholders for updates on the status of the environmental review process. Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the heads of departments shall identify and report to the President through the Chair of CEQ on: (i) all actions taken pursuant to or consistent with the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023, including the MOU; (ii) the status of all Federal commitments made pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023, and the MOU along with an identification of any such commitments that may be consistent with the policies of my Administration; (iii) any steps that may be taken to rescind or recoup Federal funds obligated to implement the MOU; and (iv) any actions that have been taken and future steps that must be taken to withdraw from the MOU. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose . The devastation of the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires shocked the American people and highlighted the catastrophic consequences when State and local governments are unable to quickly respond to such disasters. In too many cases, including in California, a slow and inadequate response to wildfires is a direct result of reckless mismanagement and lack of preparedness. Wildfires threaten every region, yet many local government entities continue to disregard commonsense preventative measures. Firefighters across the country are forced to rely on outdated technology and face challenges in quickly responding to wildfires because of unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy. The Federal Government can empower State and local leaders by streamlining Federal wildfire capabilities to improve their effectiveness and promoting commonsense, technology-enabled local strategies for land management and wildfire response and mitigation. Sec . 2 . Streamlining Federal Wildland Fire Governance . Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall, to the maximum degree practicable and consistent with applicable law, consolidate their wildland fire programs to achieve the most efficient and effective use of wildland fire offices, coordinating bodies, programs, budgets, procurement processes, and research and, as necessary, recommend additional measures to advance this objective. Sec . 3 . Encouraging Local Wildfire Preparedness and Response . (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall: (i) expand and strengthen the use of partnerships, agreements, compacts, and mutual aid capabilities that empower Federal, State, local, tribal, and community-driven land management that reduces wildfire risk and improves wildfire response, including on public lands; and (ii) develop and expand the use of other measures to incentivize responsible land management and wildfire prevention, mitigation, and response measures at the State and local levels. (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) represented at the National Interagency Fire Center, shall: (i) develop a comprehensive technology roadmap, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), to increase wildfire firefighting capabilities at the State and local levels, including through artificial intelligence, data sharing, innovative modeling and mapping capabilities, and technology to identify wildland fire ignitions and weather forecasts to inform response and evacuation; and (ii) promote the use of a risk-informed approach, as consistent with Executive Order 14239 of March 18, 2025 (Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness), to develop new policies that remove barriers to preventing and responding to wildfires, including through year-round response readiness, better forest health, and activities outlined in Executive Order 14225 of March 1, 2025 (Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production). Sec . 4 . Strengthening Wildfire Mitigation . Within 90 days of the date of this order: (a) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall consider modifying or rescinding, as consistent with applicable law, Federal rules or policies that impede the use of appropriate, preventative prescribed fires. (b) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall consider modifying or rescinding, as consistent with applicable law, Federal rules or policies hindering the appropriate use of fire retardant to fight wildfires. (c) The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall consider promoting, assisting, and facilitating, as consistent with applicable law, innovative uses of woody biomass and forest products to reduce fuel loads in areas at risk of wildfires. (d) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall consider initiating rulemaking proceedings to establish, as consistent with applicable law, best practices to reduce the risk of wildfire ignition from the bulk-power system without increasing costs for electric-power end users, including through methods such as vegetation management, the removal of forest-hazardous fuels along transmission lines, improved engineering approaches, and safer operational practices. (e) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, shall review pending and proposed wildfire-related litigation involving electrical utility companies to ensure the Department&#8217;s positions and proposed resolutions in such matters advance the wildfire prevention and mitigation efforts identified in this order. Sec . 5 . Modernizing Wildfire Prevention and Response . (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of OSTP, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the heads of relevant agencies, shall, as appropriate, identify, declassify, and make publicly available historical satellite datasets that will advance wildfire prevention and response and improve wildfire prediction and evaluation models. (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the heads of agencies represented at the National Interagency Fire Center, shall: (i) Identify rules that impede wildfire prevention, detection, or response and consider eliminating or revising those rules, as consistent with applicable law. This consideration and any resulting rulemaking proceedings shall be reflected in the Fall 2025 Unified Regulatory Agenda. (ii) Develop performance metrics for wildfire response, including metrics related to average response times, annual fuels treatments, safety and cost effectiveness, and other subjects, as appropriate for inclusion in strategic and annual performance plans. (c) Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall evaluate and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, prioritize the sale of excess aircraft and aircraft parts to support wildfire mitigation and response. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior in equal shares. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 12, 2025.

Review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States . (a) On March 14, 2024, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) received a voluntary notice describing the proposed acquisition by (1) Nippon Steel Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan (Nippon Steel); (2) Nippon Steel North America, Inc., a New York corporation (Nippon Steel NA); and (3) 2023 Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with Nippon Steel and Nippon Steel NA, the Purchasers), of United States Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (U.S. Steel, and such proposed acquisition, the Proposed Transaction). CFIUS subsequently initiated a review and investigation of the Proposed Transaction, which ultimately concluded with a referral to the President on December 23, 2024, for decision pursuant to section 721(d). (b) On January 3, 2025, pursuant to section 721(d)(1), then-President Biden issued an order titled &#8220;Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of United States Steel Corporation by Nippon Steel Corporation&#8221; (January 3 Order), which prohibited the Proposed Transaction. (c) The statutory provision on which the January 3 Order was based authorizes the President to &#8220;take such action for such time as the President considers appropriate to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.&#8221; 50 U.S.C. 4565(d)(1). Consistent with that authority, section 3 of the January 3 Order reserved the President&#8217;s authority to issue further orders as &#8220;necessary to protect the national security of the United States.&#8221; (d) Pursuant to the authority referred to in subsection (c) of this section, and the President&#8217;s authority to reconsider prior actions, on April 7, 2025, I issued a Presidential Memorandum, entitled &#8220;Review of Proposed United States Steel Corporation Acquisition&#8221; (April 7 Memo), which directed CFIUS to conduct a de novo review of the Proposed Transaction to assist me in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate. (e) CFIUS submitted a recommendation to me on May 21, 2025, which, in accordance with the April 7 Memo, described CFIUS agency views regarding the risks to national security arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction, and included views on whether any measures proposed by U.S. Steel and the Purchasers are sufficient to mitigate those national security risks. The recommendation included a statement describing the position of each member agency of CFIUS, including the reasons for such position. Sec . 2 . Findings . (a) I hereby affirm the following findings, made initially in the January 3 Order: (i) there is credible evidence that leads me to believe that the Purchasers, through the Proposed Transaction, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (ii) provisions of law other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq .) do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. (b) Based on the recommendation of and my review of the materials provided by CFIUS, including re-review of the prior assessment of risk, I additionally find that the threatened impairment to the national security of the United States arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction can be adequately mitigated if the conditions set forth in section 3 of this order are met. Sec . 3 . Actions Ordered and Authorized . On the basis of the findings set forth in section 2 of this order, considering the factors described in subsection 721(f) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that: (a) Section 2(a) of the January 3 Order is amended to read as follows: &#8220;The Proposed Transaction, and any substantially similar transaction between the Purchasers and U.S. Steel, whether effected directly or indirectly by the Purchasers, through the Purchasers&#8217; shareholders or shareholders&#8217; immediate, intermediate, or ultimate foreign person beneficial owners, or through the Purchasers&#8217; partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, is prohibited, unless the Purchasers and U.S. Steel execute with the Department of the Treasury and any other appropriate member agencies of CFIUS, on or before the closing date of the Proposed Transaction, and remain in compliance thereafter with, a national security agreement (NSA) that is materially consistent, as so determined by the Department of the Treasury, with the draft NSA submitted to the Purchasers and U.S. Steel by the United States Government on June 13, 2025.&#8221; (b) Section 2(e) of the January 3 Order is amended to read as follows: &#8220;Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under other provisions of law, and until such time as the Purchasers and U.S. Steel have either abandoned the Proposed Transaction to the satisfaction of CFIUS or entered into the NSA referred to in subsection (a) of this section, CFIUS is further authorized to implement measures, including monitoring and enforcement measures, it deems necessary and appropriate with regard to the Proposed Transaction to protect the national security of the United States, including measures available to it under section 721 and its implementing regulations, which include the remedies available for violations of any order, agreement, or condition entered into or imposed under section 721.&#8221; (c) Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of the January 3 Order are stricken. Sec . 4 . Reservation . I hereby reserve my authority to issue further orders with respect to the Purchasers or U.S. Steel as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security of the United States. Sec . 5 . Publication and Transmittal . (a) This order shall be published in the Federal Register . (b) I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transmit a copy of this order to the parties to the Proposed Transaction named in section 1 of this order. DONALD J.

Today, our Nation proudly celebrates 250 years of our Army&#8217;s strength, service, valor, and discipline. We honor its heroic legacy as the guardian of our sovereignty and our fortress against tyranny &#8212; and we pay tribute to the millions of warriors who live by the motto: This We&#8217;ll Defend. Following the first shots of the Revolutionary War at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, it became clear to the patriots that &#8212; despite their persistent efforts for peace &#8212; war against the British was necessary as a final recourse in defense of their freedom. In the wake of the Boston Massacre, the Intolerable Acts, and the enduring injustice of taxation without representation, they established the First Continental Congress in the fall of 1774 to formally address their grievances. After dozens of patriots perished at Lexington and Concord, the Colonies reconvened &#8212; and by June 14, the delegates had decided that there was only one path forward. On that spring day, in a momentous act of unity and resolve, the Congress passed a resolution to formally establish the instrument of our national defense in the form of the Continental Army. &#8220;Resolved, that six companies of expert riflemen, be immediately raised in Pennsylvania, two in Maryland, and two in Virginia&#8221; the resolution reads. With the passing of that fateful resolution, the scattered militias of the American Colonies banded together as a single force &#8212; boldly declaring that they would never waver in defense of their liberty and their home. The next day, George Washington was unanimously appointed as the Continental Army&#8217;s Commander-in-Chief. Weeks later, on July 3, 1775, he took charge of his Army in Cambridge, Massachusetts. &#8220;It is hoped that all Distinctions of Colonies will be laid aside so that one and the same Spirit may animate the whole, and the only Contest be, who shall render, on this great and trying occasion, the most essential service to the Great and common cause in which we are all engaged,&#8221; he wrote. In the days, weeks, and years that followed, that very same Army shocked the Redcoats at Trenton and Princeton, won their first great victory at Saratoga, secured the cause of independence at Yorktown, preserved the Union at Gettysburg, held the line at Chateau-Thierry, stormed the bloody beaches of Normandy, and to this day, gallantly defends our inheritance of freedom against every foe with unmatched tenacity, courage, and strength. What was first formed as a ragtag army of farmers, frontiersmen, blacksmiths, and merchants now stands as the most dominant military force ever born of human will &#8212; guided by the promise to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. To ensure our Army&#8217;s storied legacy continues well into the future, as President, I have purged the sinister ideology of &#8220;Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion&#8221; from the ranks of our military. I directed the Department of Defense to update its guidance regarding transgender &#8212; identifying medical standards to ensure our military remains the most lethal in the world. In a long overdue redress of injustice, I reinstated American service members who were dismissed for refusing the COVID vaccine, with full back pay and benefits. Every day, I am restoring a foreign policy of peace through strength &#8212; and as a result, military recruitment is soaring to historic highs. Under my leadership, the United States military will remain the mightiest, fiercest, boldest, and most revered in the entire world. On this 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States Army, we pay tribute to every legend of liberty who sacrificed their life to keep America safe, sovereign, and free. As my Administration continues the work of protecting our homeland and upholding our way of life, we proudly summon the spirit, confidence, and resolve of the intrepid men who won our independence on the battlefield 250 years ago &#8212; and we vow that their legacy of courage will never perish, and that our sacred birthright of freedom will never, ever die. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2025, as a day in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States Army. This We&#8217;ll Defend. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.

Purpose . The United States is blessed with vast beautiful landscapes, abundant natural resources, and a rich heritage of discovery by travelers and outdoorsmen. America&#8217;s national parks, forests, waterways, and public lands have inspired generations and kindled our Nation&#8217;s spirit of exploration. To ensure that the next generation of Americans inherits this same sense of duty and adventure, my Administration will prioritize conserving our great American national parks and outdoor recreation areas. Years of mismanagement, regulatory overreach, and neglect of routine maintenance require action. Land-use restrictions have stripped hunters, fishers, hikers, and outdoorsmen of access to public lands that belong to them. These bureaucratic restrictions have undermined outdoor traditions and threatened conservation funding. The National Park Service and the United States Forest Service face more than $23 billion and $10.8 billion in deferred maintenance, respectively, leaving roads, trails, and historic landmarks in disrepair. Despite these challenges, our Nation has proven that conservation and economic growth go hand in hand. Since the signing of the Great American Outdoors Act (Public Law 116-152), the outdoor recreation economy has grown to $1.2 trillion in economic output, and, in 2023, comprised 3.1 percent of employees in the United States and supported 5 million jobs. Through both innovation and commonsense policies, America can preserve its natural beauty and expand outdoor recreation opportunities for future generations. It is the policy of my Administration to prioritize responsible conservation, restore our lands and waters, and protect our Nation&#8217;s outdoor heritage for the enjoyment of the American people. Sec . 2 . General Policies . All Federal land management agencies, as defined by 16 U.S.C. 6801(3), shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that their policies: (a) promote responsible stewardship of natural resources while driving economic growth; (b) expand access to public lands and waters for recreation, hunting, and fishing; (c) encourage responsible, voluntary conservation efforts; (d) cut bureaucratic delays that hinder effective environmental management; and (e) recover America&#8217;s fish and wildlife populations through proactive, voluntary, on-the-ground collaborative conservation efforts. Sec . 3 . Establishment and Composition of the President&#8217;s Make America Beautiful Again Commission . (a) There is hereby established the President&#8217;s Make America Beautiful Again Commission (Commission), which shall be chaired by the Secretary of the Interior (Chair), with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy serving as Executive Director (Executive Director). (b) In addition to the Chair and the Executive Director, the Commission shall include the following officials or their designees: (i) the Secretary of Defense; (ii) the Secretary of Agriculture; (iii) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; (iv) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; (v) the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; (vi) the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff; (vii) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; (viii) the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality; and (ix) other members of my Administration invited to participate, at the discretion of the Chair and the Executive Director. Sec . 4 . Conserving Our National Treasures. The Commission shall advise and assist the President regarding how best to responsibly conserve America&#8217;s national treasures and natural resources, including by: (a) monitoring the implementation of this order and facilitating interagency coordination on conservation efforts; (b) providing to the President actionable recommendations for improving conservation efforts; (c) developing policies to recover fish and wildlife populations through collaboration rather than regulation, including policies involving coordination with State wildlife agencies; (d) recommending to the President solutions to expand access to clean drinking water and restore aquatic ecosystems to improve water quality and availability; and (e) developing policies to expand access to public lands, national parks, national forests, and wildlife refuges while promoting a wide range of outdoor recreation opportunities like hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, skiing, climbing, boating, off-roading, and wildlife viewing. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of the Interior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

(d)&nbsp; The Secretary of the Interior, working with the Secretary of State, shall work to encourage international tourism to America&#8217;s national parks and outdoor recreation areas, and especially wider utilization of America&#8217;s many such areas that may be underutilized.

Purpose . For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar. The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation&#8217;s natural landscape. Moreover, reliance on so-called &#8220;green&#8221; subsidies threatens national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries. Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of the United States to: (a) &nbsp;rapidly eliminate the market distortions and costs imposed on taxpayers by so-called &#8220;green&#8221; energy subsidies; (b) &nbsp;build upon and strengthen the repeal of, and modifications to, wind, solar, and other &#8220;green&#8221; energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; and (c) &nbsp;end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable &#8220;green&#8221; energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries. Sec . 3 . Tax Credits and One Big Beautiful Bill Act Implementation by the Department of the Treasury . (a) Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the &#8220;beginning of construction&#8221; are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built. (b) &nbsp;Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Sec . 4 . One Big Beautiful Bill Act Implementation by the Department of the Interior . (a) Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a review of regulations, guidance, policies, and practices under the Department of the Interior&#8217;s jurisdiction to determine whether any provide preferential treatment to wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources. The Secretary of the Interior shall then revise any identified regulations, guidance, policies, and practices as appropriate and consistent with applicable law to eliminate any such preferences for wind and solar facilities. Sec . 5 . Reports . Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the findings made under, and actions taken and planned to be taken to implement, this order. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Purpose . Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a critical role in how Americans of all ages learn new skills, consume information, and navigate their daily lives. Americans will require reliable outputs from AI, but when ideological biases or social agendas are built into AI models, they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output. One of the most pervasive and destructive of these ideologies is so-called &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; (DEI).&nbsp; In the AI context, DEI includes the suppression or distortion of factual information about race or sex; manipulation of racial or sexual representation in model outputs; incorporation of concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism; and discrimination on the basis of race or sex.&nbsp; DEI displaces the commitment to truth in favor of preferred outcomes and, as recent history illustrates, poses an existential threat to reliable AI. For example, one major AI model changed the race or sex of historical figures &#8212; including the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings &#8212; when prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize DEI requirements at the cost of accuracy.&nbsp; Another AI model refused to produce images celebrating the achievements of white people, even while complying with the same request for people of other races.&nbsp; In yet another case, an AI model asserted that a user should not &#8220;misgender&#8221; another person even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse.&nbsp; While the Federal Government should be hesitant to regulate the functionality of AI models in the private marketplace, in the context of Federal procurement, it has the obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas.&nbsp; Building on Executive Order 13960 of December 3, 2020 (Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government), this order helps fulfill that obligation in the context of large language models. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For purposes of this order: (a)&nbsp; The term &#8220;agency&#8221; means an executive department, a military department, or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 101, 102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned Government corporation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101. (b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;agency head&#8221; means the highest-ranking official or officials of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, Director, Commissioners, or Board of Directors. (c) &nbsp;The term &#8220;LLM&#8221; means a large language model, which is a generative AI model trained on vast, diverse datasets that enable the model to generate natural-language responses to user prompts. (d) &nbsp;The term &#8220;national security system&#8221; has the same meaning as in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6). Sec . 3 . Unbiased AI Principles . It is the policy of the United States to promote the innovation and use of trustworthy AI. To advance that policy, agency heads shall, consistent with applicable law and in consideration of guidance issued pursuant to section 4 of this order, procure only those LLMs developed in accordance with the following two principles (Unbiased AI Principles): (a) Truth-seeking. LLMs shall be truthful in responding to user prompts seeking factual information or analysis. LLMs shall prioritize historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity, and shall acknowledge uncertainty where reliable information is incomplete or contradictory. (b)&nbsp; Ideological Neutrality.&nbsp; LLMs shall be neutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI.&nbsp; Developers shall not intentionally encode partisan or ideological judgments into an LLM&#8217;s outputs unless those judgments are prompted by or otherwise readily accessible to the end user.&nbsp; Sec . 4 . Implementation . (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the Administrator of General Services, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall issue guidance to agencies to implement section 3 of this order. That guidance shall: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account for technical limitations in complying with this order; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;permit vendors to comply with the requirement in the second Unbiased AI Principle to be transparent about ideological judgments through disclosure of the LLM&#8217;s system prompt, specifications, evaluations, or other relevant documentation, and avoid requiring disclosure of specific model weights or other sensitive technical data where practicable; (iii) &nbsp;avoid over-prescription and afford latitude for vendors to comply with the Unbiased AI Principles and take different approaches to innovation; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;specify factors for agency heads to consider in determining whether to apply the Unbiased AI Principles to LLMs developed by the agencies and to AI models other than LLMs; and (v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make exceptions as appropriate for the use of LLMs in national security systems. (b)&nbsp; Each agency head shall, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include in each Federal contract for an LLM entered into following the date of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) of this section terms requiring that the procured LLM comply with the Unbiased AI Principles and providing that decommissioning costs shall be charged to the vendor in the event of termination by the agency for the vendor&#8217;s noncompliance with the contract following a reasonable period to cure; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;to the extent practicable and consistent with contract terms, revise existing contracts for LLMs to include the terms specified in subsection (b)(i) of this section; and (iii) &nbsp;within 90 days of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) of this section, adopt procedures to ensure that LLMs procured by the agency comply with the Unbiased AI Principles. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Purpose and Policy . Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe. The number of individuals living on the streets in the United States on a single night during the last year of the previous administration &#8212; 274,224 &#8212; was the highest ever recorded. The overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both. Nearly two-thirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, or opioids in their lifetimes. An equally large share of homeless individuals reported suffering from mental health conditions. The Federal Government and the States have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats. Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order.&nbsp; Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens.&nbsp; My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety. Sec . 2 . Restoring Civil Commitment . (a) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall take appropriate action to: (i) seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United States&#8217; policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate facilities for appropriate periods of time; and (ii) &nbsp;provide assistance to State and local governments, through technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the identification, adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and &#8220;step-down&#8221; treatment standards that allow for the appropriate commitment and treatment of individuals with mental illness who pose a danger to others or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves. Sec . 3 . Fighting Vagrancy on America&#8217;s Streets . (a) The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Secretary of Transportation shall take immediate steps to assess their discretionary grant programs and determine whether priority for those grants may be given to grantees in States and municipalities that actively meet the below criteria, to the maximum extent permitted by law: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering; (iii) &nbsp;enforce prohibitions on urban squatting; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;enforce, and where necessary, adopt, standards that address individuals who are a danger to themselves or others and suffer from serious mental illness or substance use disorder, or who are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient treatment or by moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate facilities via civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum extent permitted by law; or (v)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required, the registration and notification obligations of the Sex Offender Registry and Notification Act, particularly in the case of registered sex offenders with no fixed address, including by adequately mapping and checking the location of homeless sex offenders. (b) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that homeless individuals arrested for Federal crimes are evaluated, consistent with 18 U.S.C. 4248, to determine whether they are sexually dangerous persons and certified accordingly for civil commitment; (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;take all necessary steps to ensure the availability of funds under the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance program to support, as consistent with 34 U.S.C. 50101 et seq ., encampment removal efforts in areas for which public safety is at risk and State and local resources are inadequate; (iii) &nbsp;assess Federal resources to determine whether they may be directed toward ensuring, to the extent permitted by law, that detainees with serious mental illness are not released into the public because of a lack of forensic bed capacity at appropriate local, State, and Federal jails or hospitals; and (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;enhance requirements that prisons and residential reentry centers that are under the authority of the Attorney General or receive funding from the Attorney General require in-custody housing release plans and, to the maximum extent practicable, require individuals to comply. Sec . 4 . Redirecting Federal Resources Toward Effective Methods of Addressing Homelessness . (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate action to: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that discretionary grants issued by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery fund evidence-based programs and do not fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called &#8220;harm reduction&#8221; or &#8220;safe consumption&#8221; efforts that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;provide technical assistance to assisted outpatient treatment programs for individuals with serious mental illness or addiction during and after the civil commitment process focused on shifting such individuals off of the streets and public programs and into private housing and support networks; and (iii) &nbsp;ensure that Federal funds for Federally Qualified Health Centers and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics reduce rather than promote homelessness by supporting, to the maximum extent permitted by law, comprehensive services for individuals with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, including crisis intervention services. (b) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall prioritize available funding to support the expansion of drug courts and mental health courts for individuals for which such diversion serves public safety. Sec . 5 . Increasing Accountability and Safety in America&#8217;s Homelessness Programs . (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate actions to increase accountability in their provision of, and grants awarded for, homelessness assistance and transitional living programs. These actions shall include, to the extent permitted by law, ending support for &#8220;housing first&#8221; policies that deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency; increasing competition among grantees through broadening the applicant pool; and holding grantees to higher standards of effectiveness in reducing homelessness and increasing public safety.

A PROCLAMATION 1.&nbsp; On June 30, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effects of imports of copper in all forms (copper), including copper ores, copper concentrates, refined copper, copper alloys, scrap copper, and derivative products, on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1862 (section 232).&nbsp; Based on the facts considered in that investigation, the Secretary found and&nbsp;advised me of his opinion that copper is being imported into&nbsp;the&nbsp;United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as&nbsp;to threaten to impair the national security of&nbsp;the United States. 2.&nbsp; The Secretary found that the present quantities of copper imports and the circumstances of global excess capacity for producing copper are weakening our economy, resulting in the&nbsp;persistent threat of further closures of domestic copper production facilities and the shrinking of our ability to meet national security production requirements.&nbsp; Because of these risks, and taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security and other relevant factors,&nbsp; see&nbsp; 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary found that the present quantities and circumstances of copper imports threaten to impair the national security as provided in&nbsp;section 232. 3.&nbsp; In reaching this conclusion, the Secretary found that copper is essential to the manufacturing foundation on which United States national and economic security depend.&nbsp; Copper is the second most widely used material by the Department of Defense and is a necessary input in a range of defense systems, including aircraft, ground vehicles, ships, submarines, missiles, and ammunition.&nbsp; Copper also plays a central role in the broader United States industrial base.&nbsp; The metal&#8217;s exceptional electrical conductivity and durability also make it indispensable to critical infrastructure sectors that support the American economy, national security, and public health.&nbsp; Alternatives to copper are insufficient substitutes for these vital industries and products in many circumstances. 4.&nbsp; The Secretary found that the United States was a world leader across the value chain of copper production (mining, refining, semi-finished goods, and finished goods containing copper) for most of the 20th century.&nbsp; But despite copper being a crucial material in manufacturing and for the national and economic security of the United States, United States copper production has plummeted.&nbsp; Today, a single foreign country dominates global copper smelting and refining, controlling over 50 percent of global smelting capacity and holding four of the top five largest refining facilities. 5.&nbsp; The Secretary found that unfair trade practices abroad, exacerbated by overly burdensome environmental regulations at home, have hollowed out United States copper refining and smelting, caused the United States to be overly reliant on foreign copper imports, and prevent a path forward without strong corrective action.&nbsp; Foreign competitors leverage state subsidies and overproduction to flood international markets with artificially low-priced copper products, driving United States producers out of business.&nbsp; The United States is now dangerously dependent on foreign imports of semi-finished copper, intensive copper derivative products, and copper-containing products, and imbalances in the global markets make domestic investment increasingly unviable. 6.&nbsp; The Secretary found that United States dependency on foreign sources of copper is a national security vulnerability that could be exploited by foreign countries, weakens United States industrial resilience, exposes the American people to supply chain disruptions, economic instability, and strategic vulnerabilities, and jeopardizes the United States defense industrial base.&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; In light of these findings, the Secretary recommended a&nbsp;range of actions to adjust the imports of copper so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security.&nbsp; For example, the Secretary recommended an immediate universal 30&nbsp;percent import duty on semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products.&nbsp; The Secretary also recommended a phased universal tariff on refined copper of 15&nbsp;percent starting in 2027 and 30 percent starting in 2028.&nbsp; The Secretary further recommended a domestic sales requirement for copper input materials starting at 25 percent in 2027, a domestic sales requirement of 25 percent for high-quality copper scrap, and export controls for high-quality copper scrap.&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; After considering the Secretary&#8217;s report, the factors in section 232(d), 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), and other relevant factors, among other things, I concur with the Secretary&#8217;s finding that copper is being imported into the United States in quantities and under circumstances that threaten to impair the national security of the United States.&nbsp; In my judgment, and in light of the Secretary&#8217;s report, the factors in section 232(d), 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), and other relevant factors, among other things, I also determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose tariffs, as described below, to adjust imports of copper and its derivatives so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 9.&nbsp; To ensure that the tariffs on copper in this proclamation are not circumvented and that the purpose of this action to address the threat to impair the national security of the United States posed by imports of copper is not undermined, I also deem it necessary and appropriate to set up a process to identify and impose tariffs on certain derivatives of copper, as further described below. 10.&nbsp; In my judgment, the action in this proclamation will,&nbsp;among other things, help increase domestic production of semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, thereby reducing our Nation&#8217;s reliance on foreign sources.&nbsp; It will ensure that domestic fabricators are able to supply sufficient quantities of copper products essential for infrastructure, defense systems, and advanced manufacturing.&nbsp; This action will also promote investment, employment, and innovation in the domestic copper fabrication sector, strengthen supply chains, enhance industrial resilience, and generate meaningful economic benefits.&nbsp; This action will adjust the imports of semi-finished copper products, intensive copper derivative products, and certain other copper derivatives and is necessary and appropriate to address the threat to impair the national security of the United States posed by imports of such articles. 11.&nbsp; Section 232 authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security.&nbsp; 12.&nbsp; Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19&nbsp;U.S.C. 2483, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 13.&nbsp; Consistent with the General Terms for the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Economic Prosperity Deal (May 8, 2025), the United States intends to coordinate with the United Kingdom to adopt a structured, negotiated approach to addressing the national security threat in the copper sector. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United&nbsp;States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232; the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701&nbsp; et seq .); section 101 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA), as amended, 50 U.S.C. 4511; section 301 of title 3, United States Code; and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 2483, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1)&nbsp; Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation, shall be subject to a 50 percent tariff.&nbsp; This tariff shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025, and shall continue in effect, unless such action is expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.&nbsp; This tariff is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, unless stated otherwise below. (2)&nbsp; The Secretary, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), shall determine whether any modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this proclamation and shall make such modifications through notice in the&nbsp; Federal Register &nbsp;if needed. (3)&nbsp; Within 90 days after the date of this proclamation, the Secretary shall establish a process for including additional derivative copper articles within the scope of the duties of this proclamation, consistent with the processes established pursuant to Proclamation 10895 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States) and Proclamation 10896 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States). (4)&nbsp; The non-copper content of all copper articles subject to this proclamation shall be subject to tariffs pursuant to Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), and any other applicable duties, including those imposed by Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), as amended, Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), as amended, and Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People&#8217;s Republic of China), as amended.&nbsp; The additional duties described in clauses 1 through 3 of this proclamation shall apply only to the copper content of articles subject to this proclamation.&nbsp; CBP shall issue authoritative guidance mandating strict compliance with declaration requirements for copper content in imported articles and outlining maximum penalties for noncompliance, including that importers who submit underreported declarations may be subject to severe consequences, such as significant monetary penalties, loss of import privileges, and criminal liability, consistent with United States law. (5)&nbsp; If any product is subject to tariffs under both this proclamation and Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended, the product shall be subject to the duties imposed pursuant to Proclamation 10908, as amended, and not those imposed pursuant to this proclamation. (6) &nbsp;Any product described in clause 1 of this proclamation, except those eligible for admission as &#8220;domestic status&#8221; as described in 19 CFR 146.43, that is subject to a duty imposed by this proclamation and that is admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after the effective date of this proclamation must be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign&#8221; status as described in 19 CFR 146.41, and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading.&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of copper and its derivatives.&nbsp; The Secretary shall, from time to time, in consultation with any senior executive branch officials the Secretary deems appropriate, review the status of copper and copper derivative imports with respect to national security.&nbsp; The Secretary shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the Secretary&#8217;s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President under section 232.&nbsp; By June 30, 2026, the Secretary shall provide the President with an update on domestic copper markets, including refining capacity and the market for refined copper in the United States, so that the President may determine whether imposing a phased universal import duty on refined copper of 15 percent starting on January&nbsp;1, 2027, and 30 percent starting on January 1, 2028, as&nbsp;recommended by the June 30, 2025, report, is warranted to ensure that copper imports do not continue to threaten to impair the national security.&nbsp; The Secretary shall also inform the President of any circumstance that, in the Secretary&#8217;s opinion, might indicate that the duty rate provided for in this proclamation, or any actions modifying this proclamation, is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer necessary. (8)&nbsp; Separately, I find that copper input materials and high-quality copper scrap meet the criteria specified in section 101(b) of the DPA, 50 U.S.C. 4511(b).&nbsp; Pursuant to the authority delegated to the Secretary in Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), the Secretary shall take all appropriate action to implement the domestic sales requirements that he recommended in the June 30, 2025, report. (9)&nbsp; The Secretary may issue regulations, rules, guidance, and procedures consistent with the purpose of this proclamation, including to address operational necessity. (10)&nbsp; No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this proclamation. (11)&nbsp; CBP may take any necessary or appropriate measure to administer the tariff imposed by this proclamation. (12)&nbsp; Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.&nbsp; If any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any&nbsp;provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of July, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and fiftieth. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

National Emergency . As President of the United States, my highest duty is protecting the national security, foreign policy, and economy of this country. Recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Members of the Government of Brazil have taken actions that interfere with the economy of the United States, infringe the free expression rights of United States persons, violate human rights, and undermine the interest the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies. Members of the Government of Brazil are also politically persecuting a former President of Brazil, which is contributing to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses. Recently, members of the Government of Brazil have taken unprecedented actions that harm and are a threat to the economy of the United States, conflict with and threaten the policy of the United States to promote free speech and free and fair elections at home and abroad, and violate fundamental human rights.&nbsp; Indeed, certain Brazilian officials have issued orders to compel United States online platforms to censor the accounts or content of United States persons, where such accounts or content are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution within the United States; block the ability of United States persons to raise money on their platforms; change their content moderation policies, enforcement practices, or algorithms in ways that may result in the censorship of the content and accounts of United States persons; and provide the user data of accounts belonging to United States persons, facilitating the targeting of political critics in the United States.&nbsp; For example, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has abused his judicial authority to target political opponents, shield corrupt allies, and suppress dissent, often in coordination with other Brazilian officials.&nbsp; Justice de Moraes has authorized politically motivated police raids, arrests, and bank account freezes.&nbsp; He has also authorized the&nbsp;confiscation of passports, jailed individuals without trial&nbsp;for social media posts, opened unprecedented criminal investigations, including into United States citizens for their constitutionally protected speech in the United States, and issued secret orders to United States social media companies to censor thousands of posts and de-platform dozens of political critics, including United States persons, for lawful speech on United States soil.&nbsp; When United States and United States-headquartered companies have refused to comply with his unlawful censorship demands, Justice de Moraes has imposed substantial fines on United States and United States-headquartered companies, ordered the suspension of United States and United States-headquartered companies in Brazil, and threatened United States and United States-headquartered company executives with criminal prosecution.&nbsp; In fact, Justice de Moraes is currently overseeing the Government of Brazil&#8217;s criminal prosecution of&nbsp;a&nbsp;United States resident for speech he made on United&nbsp;States soil. These judicial actions, taken under the pretext of combatting &#8220;disinformation,&#8221; &#8220;fake news,&#8221; or &#8220;anti-democratic&#8221; or &#8220;hateful&#8221; content, endanger the economy of the United States by tyrannically and arbitrarily coercing United States companies to censor political speech, turn over sensitive United States user data, or change their content moderation policies on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market. &nbsp;These actions also chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United&nbsp;States has in protecting its citizens and companies at&nbsp;home and abroad.&nbsp; Brazilian officials are also persecuting former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro. &nbsp;The Government of Brazil has unjustly charged Bolsonaro with multiple crimes related to Bolsonaro&#8217;s 2022 runoff election, and the Supreme Court of Brazil has misguidedly ruled that Bolsonaro must stand trial for these unjustified criminal charges.&nbsp; Political persecution, through drummed up prosecutions, threatens the orderly development of Brazil&#8217;s political, administrative, and economic institutions, including undermining the ability of Brazil to hold a free and fair election of the presidency in 2026.&nbsp; The Government of Brazil&#8217;s treatment of former President Bolsonaro also contributes to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses. I find that the unprecedented actions taken by the Government of Brazil have violated the free expression rights of United States persons, interfered with the economy of the United States by coercing United States and United States-headquartered companies to censor United States persons for speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market, subverted the interest of the United States in protecting its citizens and companies, undermined the rule of law in Brazil, and jeopardized the orderly development of Brazil&#8217;s political, administrative, and economic institutions.&nbsp; The policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil are repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United&nbsp;States of America, find that the scope and gravity of the&nbsp;recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of&nbsp;Brazil constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has&nbsp;its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency with respect to that threat. To deal with the national emergency declared in this order, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional ad valorem duty rate of 40 percent on certain products of Brazil, as detailed below.&nbsp; In my judgment, this action is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in this order.&nbsp; I am taking the action in this order only for the purpose of addressing the national emergency declared in this order and not for any other purpose. Sec . 2 . Tariff Modifications . (a) Articles of Brazil imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent. This rate of duty shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, except those goods encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) or set forth in Annex I to this order, and except for goods that (1) were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit prior to entry into the United States, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order; and (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States shall be modified as provided in Annex II to this order. (b)&nbsp; U.S. Customs and Border Protection may take any necessary or appropriate measure to administer the duty imposed by this order. Sec . 3 . Scope of Duties and Stacking . (a) The ad valorem duty imposed in this order is in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports, unless subject to existing or future actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, in which case the ad valorem duty imposed in this order shall not apply. (b)&nbsp; The ad valorem duty imposed in this order shall not apply to articles that are excepted by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) or set forth in Annex I to this order, including certain silicon metal, pig iron, civil aircraft and parts and components thereof, metallurgical grade alumina, tin ore, wood pulp, precious metals, energy and energy products, and fertilizers. (c)&nbsp; The ad valorem duty imposed in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, shall apply in addition to the ad valorem duty imposed in this order, when applicable pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257. (d) &nbsp;Subject articles, except those eligible for admission under &#8220;domestic status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duty specified in section 2 of this order and are&nbsp;admitted into a foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, must&nbsp;be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign status&#8221; as defined in&nbsp;19&nbsp;CFR 146.41. Sec . 4. Modification Authority. (a) To ensure that the emergency declared in this order is dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of additional information, recommendations from senior officials, or changed circumstances. (b)&nbsp; Should the Government of Brazil retaliate against the United States in response to this action, I will modify this order to ensure the efficacy of the actions herein ordered.&nbsp; For example, if the Government of Brazil retaliates by raising tariff rates on United States exports, I will increase the ad&nbsp;valorem duty rate set forth in this order by a corresponding amount. (c) &nbsp;Should the Government of Brazil take significant steps to address the national emergency declared in this order and align sufficiently with the United States on national security, economic, and foreign policy matters described in this order, I&nbsp;may further modify this order. Sec. 5.&nbsp; Monitoring and Recommendations.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The Secretary of State shall monitor, and regularly consult with any senior official the Secretary of State deems appropriate on, the situation involving the Government of Brazil. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing shall recommend to me additional action, if necessary, if this action is not effective in resolving the emergency declared in this order or should the Government of Brazil retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken in this order or any subsequent order issued to address this emergency. Sec. 6. &nbsp;Delegation.&nbsp; The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission, is hereby authorized to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.&nbsp; The Secretary of State may, consistent with law, redelegate the authority set forth in this order within the Department of State.&nbsp; Each executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to carry out this order. Sec. 7.&nbsp; Reporting Directives.&nbsp; The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, is hereby authorized and directed to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in, and authorities exercised by, this order, consistent with section 401 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). Sec. 8.&nbsp; Severability.&nbsp; If any provision of this order, or&nbsp;the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.&nbsp; Sec. 9.&nbsp; General Provisions. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of State. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 30, 2025.

Background . In Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), I declared a national emergency arising from certain conditions, including the public health crisis caused by fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept drug trafficking organizations, other drug or human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs. In that order, I found that those conditions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193, I imposed an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent on certain articles that are products of Canada and an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent on certain energy or energy resources that are products of Canada. In Executive Order 14231 of March 6, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), I provided that the additional ad valorem rates of duties under Executive Order 14193 do not apply to articles that are products of Canada that qualify for duty-free entry under the Agreement between the United States of America, United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA), and I reduced the additional ad valorem rate of duty on potash from 25 percent to 10 percent. Section 2(d) of Executive Order 14193 provides that &#8220;[s]hould Canada retaliate against the United States . . . through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures,&#8221; I &#8220;may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed . . . to ensure the efficacy of th[e] action&#8221; taken in Executive Order 14193. Section 3(b) of Executive Order 14193 provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with other senior officials, &#8220;shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crises through cooperative enforcement actions.&#8221; I have received additional information and recommendations from various senior officials regarding, among other things, Canada&#8217;s lack of cooperation in stemming the flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs across our northern border &#8212; including its failure to devote satisfactory resources to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept drug trafficking organizations, other drug or human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs &#8212; and Canada&#8217;s efforts to retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14193, as amended. After considering the additional information and recommendations that I have received, among other things, I have determined that, for the products of Canada that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent, the additional ad valorem rate of duty shall increase from 25 percent to 35 percent. In my judgment, this action is necessary and appropriate to deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193. Sec . 2 . Implementation . (a) All articles that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent under Executive Order 14193, as amended, shall instead be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 35 percent. Accordingly, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified as provided in the Annex to this order. (b) The changes set forth herein shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025. (c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to alter or otherwise affect section 2(b) of Executive Order 14193 or section 2(a) or section 2(b) of Executive Order 14231. (d) The stacking rules set out in Executive Order 14289 of April 29, 2025 (Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles), and any subsequent order or proclamation addressing stacking of tariffs imposed under IEEPA, shall continue to apply to goods that are subject to subsection (a) of this section. (e) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether any additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register . Sec . 3 . Transshipment . (a) all articles of Canada that do not qualify as originating under USMCA and are determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties under section 2 of this order shall be subject to (i) an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent, in lieu of the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable under section 2 of this order to goods of the country of origin; (ii) any other applicable or appropriate fine or penalty, including those assessed under 19 U.S.C. 1592; and (iii) any other United States duties, fees, taxes, exactions, or charges applicable to goods of the country of origin. CBP shall not allow, consistent with applicable law, for mitigation or remission of the penalties assessed on imports found to be transshipped to evade applicable duties. (b) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of CBP, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall publish every 6 months a list of countries and specific facilities used in circumvention schemes, to inform public procurement, national security reviews, and commercial due diligence. Sec . 4 . Monitoring and Recommendations . (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall continue to monitor, and regularly consult with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, on the situation at our northern border. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in her opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall also inform the President of any circumstance that, in her opinion, might indicate that the Government of Canada has taken adequate steps to alleviate the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis or should the Government of Canada retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken in Executive Order 14193 or any subsequent order issued to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193. Sec . 5 . Delegation . The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Homeland Security. All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec . 6 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision of this order to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected. Sec . 7 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Homeland Security. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 31, 2025. Annex Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is modified as follows: (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Heading 9903.01.10 of the HTSUS is amended by deleting “25%” each place that it appears and by inserting “35%” in lieu thereof; and (b)&nbsp; Subdivision (j) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by: (i) deleting “25%” and inserting “35%” in lieu thereof, and (ii) deleting “described in headings 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, 9903.01.13, 9903.01.14, and 9903.01.15” and inserting “described in headings 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, 9903.01.13, 9903.01.14, 9903.01.15 and 9903.01.16” in lieu thereof. (c) Note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified by inserting new subdivision (m) in alphabetical order: “(m) For the purposes of heading 9903.01.16, products of Canada that do not qualify as originating under the United States-Canada-Mexico Free Trade Agreement (USMCA) and are determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties provided for by headings 9903.01.10, 9903.01.13, or 9903.01.15 shall be subject to an additional 40% ad valorem rate of duty in lieu of the additional rate of duty provided for in headings 9903.01.10, 9903.01.13, or 9903.01.15. Heading 9903.01.16 does not apply to products described in headings 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, and 9903.01.14, or products for personal use included in accompanied baggage of persons arriving in the United States. Notwithstanding U.S. note 1 to this subchapter, all products of Canada that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by heading 9903.01.16 shall also be subject to the general rates of duty imposed on products of Canada entered under subheadings in chapters 1 to 97 of the tariff schedule. The additional duties imposed by heading 9903.01.16 apply to products of Canada including both goods of Canada under the rules set forth in part 102, title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable, as well as goods for which Canada was the last country of substantial transformation prior to importation into the United States. Products of Canada that are eligible for temporary duty exemptions or reductions under subchapter II to chapter 99, shall be subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by heading 9903.01.16. The additional duties imposed by heading 9903.01.16 shall not apply to goods for which entry is properly claimed under a provision of chapter 98 of the tariff schedule pursuant to applicable regulations of CBP, and whenever CBP agrees that entry under such a provision is appropriate, except for goods entered under heading 9802.00.80; and subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60.

For heading 9802.00.80, the additional duties apply to the value of the article assembled abroad (in Canada), less the cost or value of such products of the United States, as described. Products of Canada that are provided for in heading 9903.01.16 shall continue to be subject to antidumping, countervailing, or other duties, taxes, fees, exactions and charges that apply to such products. Products of Canada that are provided for in heading 9903.01.16 that are otherwise eligible for the administrative exemption from duty and certain taxes at 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) — known as the “de minimis” exemption – may continue to qualify for the exemption, but the de minimis exemption shall cease to be available for such articles upon notification by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to the President that adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue applicable for covered articles otherwise eligible for the de minimis exemption. (d) The HTSUS is modified as follows, to implement this provision: (i) by inserting the following new heading 9903.01.16 in numerical sequence, with the material in the new heading inserted in the columns of the HTSUS labeled “Heading/Subheading”, “Article Description”, “Rates of Duty 1—General”, “Rates of Duty 1—Special” and “Rates of Duty 2”, respectively: Heading/ &nbsp; Subheading &nbsp; Article Description &nbsp; Rates of Duty &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; General &nbsp; Special &nbsp; “9903.01.16&nbsp; &nbsp; Except for products described in 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, and 9903.01.14, articles the product of Canada as provided for in subdivision (m) to note 2 to this subchapter and determined by CBP to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties. &nbsp;The duty provided in the applicable subheading + 40%&nbsp; The duty provided in the applicable subheading&nbsp; The duty provided in the applicable subheading”&nbsp; News Wire Issues Contact Visit EOP Administration Gallery Video Library America 250 Founding Fathers The Signers Subscribe to The White House newsletter Please leave blank.

Background . In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States. I declared a national emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I imposed additional ad valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate. I have received additional information and recommendations from various senior officials on, among other things, the&nbsp;continued lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships and the impact of foreign trading partners&#8217; disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers on U.S. exports, the domestic manufacturing base, critical supply chains, and the defense industrial base.&nbsp; I also have received additional information and recommendations on foreign relations, economic, and national security matters, including the status of trade negotiations, efforts to retaliate against the United States for its actions to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and efforts to align with the United States on economic and national security matters. For example, some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.&nbsp; Other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters.&nbsp; There are also some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with the United States or&nbsp;to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with the United&nbsp;States on economic and national security matters. After considering the information and recommendations that I have recently received, among other things, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners at the rates set forth in Annex I to this order, subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive Order 14257, as amended, in lieu of the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed on goods of such trading partners in Executive Order 14257, as amended. Sec . 2 . Tariff Modifications . (a) The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified as provided in Annex II to this order. These modifications shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, and entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty and shall instead remain subject to the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed in Executive Order 14257, as amended. (b)&nbsp; Certain foreign trading partners identified in Annex I to this order have agreed to, or are on the verge of concluding, meaningful trade and security agreements with the United States.&nbsp; Goods of those trading partners will remain subject to the additional ad valorem duties provided in Annex I to this order until such time as those agreements are concluded, and I issue subsequent orders memorializing the terms of those agreements. (c)&nbsp; As provided in Annex I to this order, the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to any good of the European Union is determined by the good&#8217;s current ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 (General) of the HTSUS (&#8220;Column 1 Duty Rate&#8221;).&nbsp; For a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent.&nbsp; For a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15&nbsp;percent, the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be zero. (d) &nbsp;Goods of any foreign trading partner that is not listed in Annex I to this order will be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, unless otherwise expressly provided.&nbsp; This rate shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order. (e)&nbsp; The HTSUS shall also be modified by continuing to suspend headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, and subdivisions (v)(xiii)(1)–(9) and (11)‑(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, until the effective date of the modifications provided in&nbsp;Annex II to this order.&nbsp; Upon the effective date of the modifications provided in Annex II to this order, to facilitate implementation of the rates of duty provided in Annex I to this order, headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, which are organized by rate of duty, and subdivisions (v)(xiii) (1)-(9) and (11)-(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be terminated as&nbsp;to future entries and replaced by the new trading partner-specific headings provided in Annex II to this order. (f)&nbsp; Excluding the changes set forth in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, shall continue to apply. (g)&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall be construed to alter or otherwise affect Executive Order 14298 of May 12, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions With the People&#8217;s Republic of China). (h)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether any additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the&nbsp; Federal Register . Sec . 3 . Transshipment . (a) An article determined by CBP to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties under section 2 of this order shall be subject to (i) an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent, in lieu of the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable under section 2 of this order to goods of the country of origin, (ii) any other applicable or appropriate fine or penalty, including those assessed under 19 U.S.C. 1592, and (iii) any other United States duties, fees, taxes, exactions, or charges applicable to goods of the country of origin. CBP shall not allow, consistent with applicable law, for mitigation or remission of the penalties assessed on imports found to be transshipped to evade applicable duties. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of CBP, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall publish every 6 months a list of countries and specific facilities used in circumvention schemes, to inform public procurement, national security reviews, and commercial due diligence. Sec . 4 . Implementation . The Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, as applicable, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Chair of the International Trade Commission, are directed and authorized to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal Register and by adopting rules, regulations, or guidance, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to implement this order. Each executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to implement this order. Sec . 5 . Monitoring and Recommendations . (a) The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall monitor the circumstances involving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and shall regularly consult on such circumstances with any senior official they deem appropriate. The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall inform me of any circumstance that, in their opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President. The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall also inform me of any circumstance that, in their opinion, might indicate that a foreign trading partner has taken adequate steps to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with any senior official they deem appropriate, shall recommend to me any necessary additional action if this action is not effective in resolving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257. (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in coordination with the appropriate senior officials, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should a foreign trading partner fail to take adequate steps to&nbsp;address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 or&nbsp;should a foreign trading partner retaliate against the United&nbsp;States in response to the actions taken to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 or any subsequent order issued to address that emergency. Sec . 6 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision of this order to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected. Sec . 7 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Sec . 2 . Amendment . Executive Order 13265 of June 6, 2002 (President&#8217;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports), is hereby amended as follows: (a) The title is revised to read as follows: &#8220;President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and the Reestablishment of the Presidential Fitness Test&#8221;. (b) The preamble is revised to read as follows: &#8220;By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to establish the President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and to reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test, it is hereby ordered:&#8221;. (c) Sections 1 through 5 are revised to read as follows: &#8220; Section 1 . Purpose . As the United States prepares to celebrate its semiquincentennial anniversary in 2026, we must address the threat to the vitality and longevity of our country that is posed by America&#8217;s declining health and physical fitness. For far too long, the physical and mental health of the American people has been neglected. Rates of obesity, chronic disease, inactivity, and poor nutrition are at crisis levels, particularly among our children. These trends weaken our economy, military readiness, academic performance, and national morale. President Eisenhower recognized this issue when he created the President&#8217;s Council on Youth Fitness in response to reports on the poor state of youth fitness in America. As President-elect, John F. Kennedy famously published an essay titled &#8220;The Soft American,&#8221; which outlined the imperative for improved health in order to maintain a strong and vital America. During my first term, I renamed the council the &#8220;President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition&#8221; and directed the development of a National Youth Sports Strategy, among other activities. My Administration has taken decisive action to reverse this health crisis. In the first month of my second term, I created the President&#8217;s Make America Healthy Again Commission to restore the urgency of improving the health of Americans. Now, we build further. To advance this commitment, I hereby reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test, which shall be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the support of the Secretary of Education. With this order, I revitalize the President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition as a cornerstone of our national health renewal. In 2026, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our great Nation, honor the 70th anniversary of the original President&#8217;s Council on Youth Fitness, and showcase America&#8217;s continued global dominance in sports. Over the next 3 years, America will host the Ryder Cup, the President&#8217;s Cup, the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympic Games &#8212; the world&#8217;s premiere sporting competitions. These events will provide inspiration for all generations of Americans. Sec . 2 . Policy . It is the policy of my Administration to: (a) prioritize and expand children&#8217;s participation in youth sports and active play; (b) promote the physical, mental, and civic benefits of daily movement, exercise, and good nutrition; and (c) engage every sector &#8212; public and private, civilian and military &#8212; in creating a national culture of strength, vitality, and excellence. Sec . 3 . President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition . (a) There is hereby established the President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition (Council). (b) The Council shall consist of up to 30 members appointed by the President. Members shall serve for a term of 2 years, shall be eligible for reappointment, and may continue to serve after the expiration of their terms until the appointment of a successor. The President may designate one or more of the members as Chair or Vice Chair. (c) The President shall designate an Executive Director of the Council who shall manage day-to-day operations; serve as a liaison to the President on matters and activities pertaining to the Council; and oversee engagement with executive departments and agencies, athletic institutions, and community partners. Sec . 4 . Functions of the Council . (a) The Council shall advise the President concerning progress made in carrying out the provisions of this order and shall recommend to the President actions to accelerate such progress. (b) In advising the President pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Council shall recommend: (i) strategies for reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test, with any appropriate improvements, as the main assessment tool for a Presidential Fitness Award; (ii) strategies for the development and promotion of Presidential challenges and school-based programs that reward excellence in physical education; (iii) actions to expand opportunities at the global, national, State, and local levels for participation in sports and engagement in physical fitness; (iv) bold and innovative fitness goals for American youth with the aim of fostering a new generation of healthy, active citizens; (v) campaigns and events that elevate American sports, military readiness, and health traditions; (vi) opportunities at the global, national, State, and local levels that expand participation in sports and emphasize the importance of an active lifestyle and good nutrition, which should include partnerships with professional athletes, sports organizations, player&#8217;s associations, influential figures, nonprofit organizations, and community groups to inspire all Americans, among other initiatives; and (vii) strategies to address the growing national security threat posed by the increasing rates of childhood obesity, chronic diseases, and sedentary lifestyles, which threaten the future readiness of the United States workforce and military. Sec . 5 . Administration . (a) Each executive department and agency shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of funds, furnish such information and assistance to the Council as it may request. (b) Members of the Council shall serve without compensation but may receive travel reimbursement, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as allowed under applicable law (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707), consistent with the availability of funds.

Background . Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022 (Prohibiting Certain Imports and New Investments With Respect to Continued Russian Federation Efforts To Undermine the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine), expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021 (Blocking Property With Respect To Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation), to include the actions taken against Ukraine by the Government of the Russian Federation. To address that unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, Executive Order 14066 prohibited, among other things, the importation into the United States of certain products of Russian Federation origin, including crude oil; petroleum; and petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation. I have received additional information from various senior officials on, among other things, the actions of the Government of the Russian Federation with respect to the situation in Ukraine.&nbsp; After considering this additional information, among other things, I find that the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066 continues and that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. To deal with the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles of India, which is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.&nbsp; In my judgment, imposing tariffs, as described below, in addition to maintaining the other measures taken to address the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066, will more effectively deal with the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066.&nbsp; Sec . 2 . Imposition of Tariffs . (a) I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. (b)&nbsp; Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional&nbsp; ad valorem&nbsp; rate of duty of 25 percent.&nbsp; Subject to section 3 of this order, this rate of duty shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 21 days after the date of this order, except for goods that (1) were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 21 days after the date of this order; and (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 17, 2025. Sec. 3.&nbsp; Scope of Duties and Stacking. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;duty imposed in section 2 of this order shall be in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports, unless subject to existing or future actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, in which case the&nbsp; ad valorem&nbsp; duty imposed in this order shall not apply. (b)&nbsp; The&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;duty imposed in section 2 of this order shall not apply to articles that are excepted by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b). (c) The ad valorem duty imposed in section 2 of this order shall not apply to articles that are set forth in Annex II to Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended. (d)&nbsp; The&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;duty imposed in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as amended, shall apply in addition to the&nbsp; ad valorem &nbsp;duty imposed in section 2 of this order, when applicable pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257. (e) Except for those articles that are eligible for admission under &#8220;domestic status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, articles that are subject to the duty imposed in section 2 of this order and are admitted into a foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 21 days after the date of this order must be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.41. Sec . 4 . Modification Authority . (a) To ensure that the emergency described in section 1 of this order is dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of additional information, recommendations from senior officials, or changed circumstances. (b)&nbsp; Should a foreign country retaliate against the United States in response to this action, I may modify this order to ensure the efficacy of the actions herein ordered.&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Should the Government of the Russian Federation or a foreign country impacted by this order take significant steps to address the national emergency described in section 1 of this order and align sufficiently with the United States on national security, foreign policy, and economic matters, I may further modify this order. Sec . 5 . Monitoring and Recommendations . (a) The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and any other senior official the Secretary of Commerce deems appropriate, shall determine whether any other country is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. If the Secretary of Commerce finds that a country is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, shall recommend whether and to what extent I should take action as to that country, including whether I should impose an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent on imports of articles of that country. (b)&nbsp; The Secretary of State shall monitor and regularly consult with any senior official the Secretary of State deems appropriate on the emergency described in section 1 of this order. (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, shall recommend to me additional action, if necessary, if the actions in this order are not effective in resolving the emergency described in section 1 of this order or should the Government of the Russian Federation or another foreign country retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken in this order or any subsequent order issued to address the emergency described in section 1 of this order.

The Secretary of State may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of State. Each executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to carry out this order. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the United States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register . (c) U.S. Customs and Border Protection may take any necessary or appropriate measure to administer a duty imposed by this order or any action taken pursuant to this order. Sec . 7 . Definitions .

Background . As President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, it is my solemn duty to protect law-abiding citizens from the destructive forces of criminal activity. That obligation applies with special force in our Nation&#8217;s capital, where, as Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, I must also ensure that all citizens can avail themselves of the right to interact with their elected representatives, and that the Federal Government can properly function, without fear of being subjected to violent, menacing street crime. The local government of the District of Columbia has lost control of public order and safety in the city, as evidenced by the two embassy staffers who were murdered in May, the Congressional intern who was fatally shot a short distance from the White House in June, and the Administration staffer who was mercilessly beaten by a violent mob days ago. Citizens, tourists, and staff alike are unable to live peacefully in the Nation&#8217;s capital, which is under siege from violent crime. It is a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world. It is my duty to our citizens and Federal workers to secure the safety and the peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal Government, and our city. Sec . 2 . Mobilizing the District of Columbia National Guard . Pursuant to my authority under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the District of Columbia, I direct the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the District of Columbia National Guard and order members to active service, in such numbers as he deems necessary, to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation&#8217;s capital. The mobilization and duration of duty shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia. Further, I direct the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia . Washington, District of Columbia, is our Nation&#8217;s capital and home to the central institutions of American governance. Yet rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government, and forces the diversion of critical public resources toward emergency response and security measures. The city government&#8217;s failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government&#8217;s ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation&#8217;s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence. The increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic has consequences beyond the individual tragedies that have dominated media coverage. &nbsp;Such lawlessness also poses intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia. &nbsp;Violence and crime hamper the recruitment and retention of essential Federal employees, undermine critical functions of Government and thus the well-being of the entire Nation, and erode confidence in the strength of the United States. &nbsp;These conditions are disgraceful anywhere, but particularly in the capital of our Nation and the seat of the Federal Government.&nbsp; Citizens, tourists, and Federal workers deserve peace and security, not fear and violence. &nbsp;The smooth functioning of executive departments and agencies, courts, diplomatic missions, and the Federal Government demands an effective law-enforcement mechanism capable of halting the precipitous rise in violent crime, not one that permits Government workers to be violently attacked by mobs or fatally shot close to the Federal buildings where they work. The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States. &nbsp;In 2024, the District of Columbia averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide. &nbsp;Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 States, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents. &nbsp;It also experienced the Nation&#8217;s highest vehicle theft rate with 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents &#8212; over three times the national average of 250.2 thefts per 100,000 residents. &nbsp;The District of Columbia is, by some measures, among the top 20 percent of the most dangerous cities in the world. As President, I have a solemn duty to take care that our laws are faithfully executed, and a sacred responsibility to protect the safety and security of United States citizens who live in and visit our Nation&#8217;s capital, including Federal workers who live or commute into the District of Columbia. &nbsp;These conditions cannot persist. &nbsp;We will make the District of Columbia one of the safest cities in the world, not the most dangerous. Sec . 2 . Services of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia . I determine that special conditions of an emergency nature exist that require the use of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (Metropolitan Police force) for Federal purposes, including maintaining law and order in the Nation&#8217;s seat of Government; protecting Federal buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government. Effective immediately, the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act. Sec . 3 . Operational Control of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia . (a) The authority of the President conferred by section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act to direct the Mayor with respect to the current special conditions of an emergency nature is delegated to the Attorney General. (b) &nbsp;In accordance with section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act, the Mayor shall provide such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the Attorney General may deem necessary and appropriate. Sec . 4 . Monitoring and Recommendations . (a) The Attorney General shall monitor and regularly consult with any senior official the Attorney General deems appropriate on the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes. (b)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall regularly update me on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes. (c)&nbsp; The Attorney General shall inform me of any circumstances that, in the Attorney General&#8217;s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President or that the action in this order is no longer necessary. Sec . 5 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) &nbsp;The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Purpose and Policy . America has long led the world in innovation, technological advancement, and design. But with a sprawling ecosystem of digital services offered to Americans, the Government has lagged behind in usability and aesthetics. There is a high financial cost to maintaining legacy systems, to say nothing of the cost in time lost by the American public trying to navigate them. It is time to fill the digital potholes across our Nation. With this order, I am announcing &#8220;America by Design,&#8221; a national initiative to improve experiences for Americans, starting by breathing new life into the design of sites where people interface with their Government.&nbsp; It is time to update the Government&#8217;s design language to be both usable and beautiful. &nbsp;This effort will be facilitated by a new National Design Studio and by a new Chief Design Officer.&nbsp; The Chief Design Officer will help recruit top creative talent, coordinate with executive departments and agencies (agencies), and devise innovative solutions. It is the policy of my Administration to deliver digital and physical experiences that are both beautiful and efficient, improving the quality of life for our Nation.&nbsp; Towards that end, the National Design Studio will advise agencies on how to reduce duplicative design costs, use standardized design to enhance the public&#8217;s trust in high-impact service providers, and dramatically improve the quality of experiences offered to the American public. Sec . 2 . Establishing America by Design and the National Design Studio . (a) There is established a national initiative, America by Design, to improve comprehensively the visual presentation and usability of Federal services provided to the public in both digital and physical spaces, creating first-class online and offline experiences for Americans. (b) &nbsp;To help facilitate the America by Design initiative, there is established within the White House Office of the Executive Office of the President the National Design Studio (NDS) and, within the NDS, a new position entitled the Chief Design Officer.&nbsp; The NDS shall be led by an Administrator, who shall report to the Office of the White House Chief of Staff.&nbsp; There is further established within the NDS, in accordance with section 3161 of title 5, United States Code, a&nbsp;temporary organization headed by the NDS Administrator and dedicated to helping advance the America by Design initiative.&nbsp; The temporary organization shall terminate 3 years from the date of this order, but that termination shall not be interpreted to imply the termination, attenuation, or amendment of any other authority or provision of this order. Sec . 3 . Implementing America by Design . (a) Heads of agencies shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to implement the America by Design initiative at their respective agencies and shall produce initial results by July 4, 2026. (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heads of agencies shall prioritize improving websites and physical sites that have a major impact on Americans&#8217; everyday lives.&nbsp; (ii) The Administrator of General Services shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to update the United States Web Design System consistent with the policies set forth in this order. (iii) &nbsp;Heads of agencies shall consult with the Chief Design Officer to ensure Government-wide compliance with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act, Public Law 115-336. (b) The Chief Design Officer shall consult with thought leaders and research and design firms on how best to implement the America by Design initiative. In order to employ the most talented designers of our generation to serve their country, the Chief Design Officer shall help recruit designers and other experts from the private sector as well as other sources of expertise. Heads of agencies shall use all relevant hiring authorities to facilitate this effort, including title IV of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, Public Law 91-648, 5 U.S.C. 3371 et seq. (c)&nbsp; The Chief Design Officer shall consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, as appropriate, in carrying out his or her obligations under this order. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

On July 2, 2021, as an empowered Taliban was in the midst of waging a civil war in Afghanistan, President Joe Biden began a disastrous withdrawal from Bagram Airfield in the middle of the night without alerting Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.&nbsp; As a direct result of the Biden Administration&#8217;s reckless political stunt designed to claim victory on the 20th anniversary of September 11, 2001, our men and women in uniform were left without a defensible base of operations, allowing the Taliban to free thousands of bloodthirsty terrorists and criminals held captive at Bagram prison. At exactly 5:36pm on August 26, 2021, a barbaric ISIS-K terrorist &#8212; one of the prisoners set free by the Taliban less than two months earlier &#8212; detonated a suicide bomb at a civilian gate of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, the main entry point for an evacuation operation.&nbsp; As a result, 13 brave American service members were killed, 45 were wounded, and more than 160 civilians were injured, resulting in the single deadliest day for United States forces in a decade. In what will be remembered as one of the most shameful and heartbreaking moments in our Nation&#8217;s collective memory, Joe Biden checked his watch &#8212; and time stood still &#8212; as a Sailor, Soldier, and 11 Marines returned home in flag-draped coffins, solemnly escorted by their brothers and sisters in arms.&nbsp; We will never forget the names of the 13 brave souls who shed their blood for our Nation: &nbsp;Staff Sergeant Darin T. Hoover, USMC; Sergeant Johanny Rosario Pichardo, USMC; Sergeant Nicole L. Gee, USMC; Corporal Hunter Lopez, USMC; Corporal Daegan W. Page, USMC; Corporal Humberto A. Sanchez, USMC; Lance Corporal David L. Espinoza, USMC; Lance Corporal Jared M. Schmitz, USMC; Lance Corporal Rylee J. McCollum, USMC; Lance Corporal Dylan R. Merola, USMC; Lance Corporal Kareem M. Nikoui, USMC; Petty Officer Third Class Maxton W. Soviak, USN; and Staff Sergeant Ryan C. Knauss, USA. As Commander in Chief, I will never allow our military service members to be so betrayed, our friends to be so abandoned, and our credibility to be so destroyed. To those who lost a son, daughter, brother, sister, husband, wife, or family member at Abbey Gate in 2021 &#8212; we offer you our enduring love and our unwavering devotion.&nbsp; To those who horrifically suffered life-altering wounds &#8212; we extend our unending support and eternal gratitude for your unsung sacrifices.&nbsp; To those who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and beyond &#8212; you should be tremendously proud of your service to our Nation and your devotion to preserving our freedoms. The events of that day led to an unimaginable loss of human life and the single most embarrassing display of American foreign policy in the history of our country.&nbsp; In the wake of the attack, countless Americans and our Afghan allies were abandoned behind Taliban lines, 10 innocent civilians &#8212; including children &#8212; were killed in a feckless counterstrike ordered by President Biden, $85 billion worth of United States military equipment was surrendered to the enemy, and 20 years of American blood and treasure were utterly squandered.&nbsp; The weakness and incompetence that led to Abbey Gate lived on in the&nbsp;American memory as the moment our credibility was all but lost &#8212; until the clock struck noon on January 20, 2025. On day one, my Administration sought to bring justice to the families of the Abbey Gate 13 by aggressively pursuing a foreign policy rooted in the commonsense principle of peace through strength.&nbsp; Just 43 days into my second term, on the night of March 4, 2025, during my Joint Address to the Congress, I announced that we apprehended the ISIS Jihadi responsible for the atrocity at the Kabul airport &#8212; who was at that moment being brought to the United States to face the swift sword of American justice.&nbsp; When America is strong, the world is safe, fewer conflicts erupt on the field of battle, and the lives of our men and women in uniform are cherished and protected. As our Nation solemnly marks 4 years since the attack at Abbey Gate, we honor the memory of the 13 brave souls and every military service member to ever die in the line of duty &#8212; and we renew our resolve to protect American lives, defend American interests, and uphold American sovereignty. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2025, as a day in commemoration of the 4th anniversary of the attack at Abbey Gate.&nbsp; I encourage all Americans to remember the heroism of the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, and the Gold Star Families who carry on their proud legacy. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Purpose and Policy . Maintaining order and public safety requires incarcerating individuals whose pending criminal charges or criminal history demonstrate a clear ongoing risk to society. When these individuals are released without bail under city or State policies, they are permitted &#8212; even encouraged &#8212; to further endanger law-abiding, hard-working Americans because they know our laws will not be enforced. Our great law enforcement officers risk their lives to arrest potentially violent criminals, only to be forced to arrest the same individuals, sometimes for the same crimes, while they await trial on the previous charges. This is a waste of public resources and a threat to public safety. As President, I will require commonsense policies that protect Americans&#8217; safety and well-being by incarcerating individuals who are known threats.&nbsp; It is therefore the policy of my Administration that Federal policies and resources should not be used to support jurisdictions with cashless bail policies, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Sec . 2 . Consequences for Cashless Bail Jurisdictions . (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, a list of States and local jurisdictions that have, in the Attorney General&#8217;s opinion, substantially eliminated cash bail as a potential condition of pretrial release from custody for crimes that pose a clear threat to public safety and order, including offenses involving violent, sexual, or indecent acts, or burglary, looting, or vandalism. The Attorney General shall update this list as necessary. (b) &nbsp;The head of each executive department and agency, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall identify Federal funds, including grants and contracts, currently provided to cashless bail jurisdictions identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section that may be suspended or terminated, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

MEASURES TO END CASHLESS BAIL AND ENFORCE THE LAW IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,EXECUTIVE ORDER,25/08/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/measures-to-end-cashless-bail-and-enforce-the-law-in-the-district-of-columbia/,"Measures To End Cashless Bail And Enforce The Law In The District Of Columbia &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J.

Purpose and Policy . As stated in Executive Order 14333 of August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia), there is a crime emergency in Washington, D.C., that is impeding the operations and responsibilities of the Federal Government. The District of Columbia government&#8217;s pretrial release policies, which include prohibiting cash bail, contribute to the disgraceful conditions referenced in the aforementioned Executive Order, as law enforcement must arrest the same individuals multiple times, and dangerous criminals are sometimes rapidly released. This leaves such criminals free to endanger American citizens visiting our Nation&#8217;s capital, Federal workers discharging their duties to our Nation, and citizens of the District of Columbia trying to live their lives safely. It is therefore the policy of my Administration that all necessary and lawful measures be taken to end cashless bail policies and ensure the pretrial detention of any criminal suspect who threatens public safety. Sec . 2 . Ending Unwarranted Pretrial Release in the District of Columbia . (a) To prevent the release of dangerous suspects based on cashless bail policies, relevant Federal law enforcement agencies and officials who are members of the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force established in Executive Order 14252 of March 27, 2025 (Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful), shall work to ensure that arrestees in the District of Columbia are held in Federal custody to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, and shall pursue Federal charges and pretrial detention for such arrestees whenever possible, consistent with applicable law, to ensure that criminal defendants who pose a threat to public safety are not released from custody prior to trial. (b)&nbsp; Further, the Attorney General shall review the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) General Orders and other policies and practices of the MPD to identify those that may result in pretrial release of criminal defendants who pose a threat to public safety and, consistent with section 740 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198), shall request that the Mayor of the District of Columbia make such updates and modifications to such orders and policies as the Attorney General determines would be necessary to address the crime emergency and help to ensure public order and safety. Sec . 3 . Measures to End Cashless Bail in the District of Columbia . (a) The Attorney General shall determine whether the District of Columbia continues to maintain a policy or practice of prohibiting cash bail as a potential condition of pretrial release from jail for crimes prosecuted under the Code of the District of Columbia in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia where the arrestee poses a clear threat to public safety and order. Such cases include violent or sexual offenses such as rape, murder, carjacking, and assault, as well as property offenses such as burglary, looting, and vandalism. The Attorney General shall update her determination if the District of Columbia changes its cashless bail policies or practices. (b) If the Attorney General determines that the District of Columbia continues to maintain a policy or practice of prohibiting cash bail, the head of each executive department or agency (agency), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall identify appropriate actions to press the District of Columbia to change its policies with respect to cashless bail. Such actions may include Federal funding decisions or the provision of Federal services or approvals by agency heads, as well as actions the Attorney General identifies as necessary and appropriate because of the emergency conditions based upon which section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act has been invoked. The head of each agency shall undertake any such actions he or she deems appropriate, consistent with applicable law. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J.

Purpose . Our great American Flag is the most sacred and cherished symbol of the United States of America, and of American freedom, identity, and strength. Over nearly two-and-a-half centuries, many thousands of American patriots have fought, bled, and died to keep the Stars and Stripes waving proudly. The American Flag is a special symbol in our national life that should unite and represent all Americans of every background and walk of life. Desecrating it is uniquely offensive and provocative. It is a statement of contempt, hostility, and violence against our Nation &#8212; the clearest possible expression of opposition to the political union that preserves our rights, liberty, and security. Burning this representation of America may incite violence and riot. American Flag burning is also used by groups of foreign nationals as a calculated act to intimidate and threaten violence against Americans because of their nationality and place of birth. Notwithstanding the Supreme Court&#8217;s rulings on First Amendment protections, the Court has never held that American Flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to &#8220;fighting words&#8221; is constitutionally protected.&nbsp; See Texas v. Johnson , 491 U.S. 397, 408-10 (1989). My Administration will act to restore respect and sanctity to the American Flag and prosecute those who incite violence or otherwise violate our laws while desecrating this symbol of our country, to the fullest extent permissible under any available authority. Sec . 2 . Measures to Combat Desecration of the American Flag . (a) The Attorney General shall prioritize the enforcement to the fullest extent possible of our Nation&#8217;s criminal and civil laws against acts of American Flag desecration that violate applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment. This may include, but is not limited to, violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination against American citizens, or other violations of Americans&#8217; civil rights; and crimes against property and the peace, as well as conspiracies and attempts to violate, and aiding and abetting others to violate, such laws. (b)&nbsp; In cases where the Department of Justice or another executive department or agency (agency) determines that an instance of American Flag desecration may violate an applicable State or local law, such as open burning restrictions, disorderly conduct laws, or destruction of property laws, the agency shall refer the matter to the appropriate State or local authority for potential action. (c)&nbsp; To the maximum extent permitted by the Constitution, the Attorney General shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area. (d) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting within their respective authorities, shall deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas, residence permits, naturalization proceedings, and other immigration benefits, or seek removal from the United States, pursuant to Federal law, including 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), 8 U.S.C. 1424, 8 U.S.C. 1427, 8 U.S.C. 1451(c), and 8 U.S.C. 1227(a), whenever there has been an appropriate determination that foreign nationals have engaged in American Flag-desecration activity under circumstances that permit the exercise of such remedies pursuant to Federal law. Sec . 3 . Severability . If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec . 4 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

In furtherance of Executive Order 14333 of August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia), I am now ordering further actions to address the conditions described in that Executive Order.

(b) &nbsp;The United States Attorney for the District of Columbia shall, subject to the availability of appropriations and applicable law, hire additional prosecutors to focus on prosecuting violent and property crimes. (c) &nbsp;The D.C.

Safe and Beautiful Task Force, as well as other relevant components of the Department of Justice as the Attorney General determines, shall further, subject to the availability of appropriations and applicable law, immediately create and begin training, manning, hiring, and equipping a specialized unit that is dedicated to ensuring public safety and order in the Nation&#8217;s capital that can be deployed whenever the circumstances necessitate, and that could be deployed, subject to applicable law, in other cities where public safety and order has been lost. (d)(i) The Secretary of Defense shall, subject to the availability of appropriations and applicable law, immediately create and begin training, manning, hiring, and equipping a specialized unit within the District of Columbia National Guard, subject to activation under Title 32 of the United States Code, that is dedicated to ensuring public safety and order in the Nation&#8217;s capital. As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, shall each deputize the members of this unit to enforce Federal law. (ii) The Secretary of Defense shall immediately begin ensuring that each State&#8217;s Army National Guard and Air National Guard are resourced, trained, organized, and available to assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety and order whenever the circumstances necessitate, as appropriate under law. In coordination with the respective adjutants general, the Secretary of Defense shall designate an appropriate number of each State&#8217;s trained National Guard members to be reasonably available for rapid mobilization for such purposes. In addition, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure the availability of a standing National Guard quick reaction force that shall be resourced, trained, and available for rapid nationwide deployment. (e) &nbsp;The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall investigate any non-compliance with the crime-prevention and safety requirements of HUD agreements by the District of Columbia Housing Authority or any landlord in the District of Columbia.&nbsp; These investigations shall include consideration of the provisions of such agreements that require housing providers to maintain safe, decent, and sanitary conditions or to restrict tenants who engage in criminal activity that threatens health, safety, and the right to peaceful enjoyment for other tenants, including engaging in drug distribution, violent criminal activity, and domestic violence.&nbsp; The Secretary of HUD shall refer any findings of non-compliance to the Attorney General, Federal law enforcement authorities, the District of Columbia Housing Authority Police Department, and the Metropolitan Police Department, as appropriate. (f) &nbsp;The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct additional inspections, audits, and examinations to determine whether conditions exist in federally-funded transit services in the District of Columbia that endanger transit workers, and take appropriate remedial action that is within the Department of Transportation&#8217;s authority.

Purpose . The Founders, in line with great societies before them, attached great importance to Federal civic architecture. They wanted America&#8217;s public buildings to inspire the American people and encourage civic virtue. President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson consciously modeled the most important buildings in Washington, D.C., on the classical architecture of ancient Athens and Rome. They sought to use classical architecture to visually connect our contemporary Republic with the antecedents of democracy in classical antiquity, reminding citizens not only of their rights but also their responsibilities in maintaining and perpetuating its institutions. Washington and Jefferson personally oversaw the competitions to design the Capitol Building and the White House. Under the direction and following the vision of these two Founders, Pierre Charles L&#8217;Enfant designed the Nation&#8217;s capital as a classical city. For approximately a century and a half following America&#8217;s founding, America&#8217;s Federal architecture continued to be characterized by beautiful and beloved buildings of largely, though not exclusively, classical design. In the 1960s, the Federal Government largely replaced traditional designs for new construction with modernist and brutalist ones. The Federal architecture that ensued, overseen by the General Services Administration (GSA), was often unpopular with Americans. The new buildings ranged from the undistinguished to designs even GSA now admits many in the public found unappealing. In 1994, GSA responded to this widespread criticism by establishing the Design Excellence Program. The GSA intended that program to &#8220;provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government.&#8221; Unfortunately, the program has not met this goal. Under the Design Excellence Program, GSA has often selected designs by prominent architects with little regard for local input or regional aesthetic preferences. The resulting Federal architecture sometimes impresses the architectural elite, but not the American people who the buildings are meant to serve. Many of these new Federal buildings are not even visibly identifiable as civic buildings. It is time to update the policies guiding Federal architecture to address these problems and ensure that architects designing Federal buildings serve their clients, the American people. Sec. 2. Policy. (a) Applicable Federal public buildings should uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, and command respect from the general public. They should also be visually identifiable as civic buildings and, as appropriate, respect regional architectural heritage. Architecture &#8212; particularly traditional and classical architecture &#8212; that meets the criteria set forth in this subsection is the preferred architecture for applicable Federal public buildings. In the District of Columbia, classical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings absent exceptional factors necessitating another kind of architecture. (b) Where the architecture of applicable Federal public buildings diverges from the preferred architecture set forth in subsection (a) of this section, great care and consideration must be taken to choose a design that commands respect from the general public and clearly conveys to the general public the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of America&#8217;s system of self-government. (c) When renovating, reducing, or expanding applicable Federal public buildings that do not meet the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the feasibility and potential expense of building redesign to meet those criteria should be examined. Where feasible and economical, such redesign should be given substantial consideration, especially with regard to the building&#8217;s exterior. Sec . 3 . Definitions . For the purposes of this order: (a) &#8220;Applicable Federal public building&#8221; means: (i) all Federal courthouses and agency headquarters; (ii) all Federal public buildings in the National Capital Region; and (iii) all other Federal public buildings that cost or are expected to cost more than $50 million in 2025 dollars to design, build, and finish, but does not include infrastructure projects or land ports of entry. (b) &#8220;Brutalist architecture&#8221; means the style of architecture that grew out of the early 20th-century modernist movement that is characterized by a massive and block-like appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of exposed poured concrete. (c) &#8220;Classical architecture&#8221; means the architectural tradition derived from the forms, principles, and vocabulary of the architecture of Greek and Roman antiquity, and as later developed and expanded upon by such Renaissance architects as Alberti, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, and Palladio; such Enlightenment masters as Robert Adam, John Soane, and Christopher Wren; such 19th-century architects as Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Robert Mills, and Thomas U. Walter; and such 20th-century practitioners as Julian Abele, Daniel Burnham, Rafael Carmoega, Charles F. McKim, John Russell Pope, Julia Morgan, and the firm of Delano and Aldrich. Classical architecture encompasses such styles as Neoclassical, Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Beaux-Arts, and Art Deco. (d) &#8220;Deconstructivist architecture&#8221; means the style of architecture generally known as &#8220;deconstructivism&#8221; that emerged during the late 1980s and that features fragmentation, disorder, discontinuity, distortion, skewed geometry, and the appearance of instability. (e) &#8220;General public&#8221; means members of the public who are not: (i) artists, architects, engineers, art or architecture critics, instructors or professors of art or architecture, or members of the building industry; or (ii) affiliated with any interest group, trade association, or any other organization, whose membership is financially affected by decisions involving the design, construction, or remodeling of public buildings. (f) &#8220;Public building&#8221; has the meaning given that term in section 3301(a)(5) of title 40, United States Code. (g) &#8220;Traditional architecture&#8221; includes classical architecture, as defined herein, and also includes the historic humanistic architecture such as Gothic, Romanesque, Second Empire, Pueblo Revival, Spanish Colonial, and other Mediterranean styles of architecture historically rooted in various regions of America. (h) &#8220;2025 dollars&#8221; means dollars adjusted for inflation using the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217;s Gross Domestic Product price deflator and using 2025 as the base year. Sec . 4 . Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture . (a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall to the extent practicable adhere to the following Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture: (i) The policy shall be to provide requisite and adequate facilities in an architectural style and form that is distinguished and that will reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government. Because of their proven ability to meet these requirements, classical and traditional architecture are preferred modes of architectural design. This preference does not exclude the possibility of alternative styles in appropriate circumstances. Major emphasis should be placed on the choice of designs that embody architectural excellence. Specific attention should be paid to the possibilities of incorporating into such designs qualities that reflect the regional architectural traditions of that part of the Nation in which buildings are located. Where appropriate, fine art should be incorporated in the designs, with emphasis on the work of living American artists. Designs shall adhere to sound construction practice and utilize materials, methods, and equipment of proven dependability. Buildings shall be economical to build, operate, and maintain, and should be accessible to the handicapped. (ii) Design must flow from the needs of the Government and the aspirations and preferences of the American people to the architectural profession, and not vice versa. Competitions for the design of Federal buildings should be held where appropriate. The advice of distinguished architects practiced in classical or traditional architecture should, as a rule, be sought prior to the award of important design contracts. (iii) The choice and development of the building site should be considered the first step of the design process. This choice should be made in cooperation with local agencies. Special attention should be paid to the general ensemble of streets and public places of which Federal buildings will form a part. Where possible, buildings should be located so as to permit a generous development of landscape. Sec . 5 . GSA Actions . (a) The Administrator of General Services (Administrator) shall adhere to the policies and principles set forth in sections 2 and 4 of this order, and shall expeditiously update GSA policies and procedures to incorporate such policies and principles and advance the purposes of this order. (b) The Administrator shall: (i) ensure that GSA architects whose duties include reviewing, assisting with, or approving the selection of architects or designs for applicable Federal public buildings have formal training in, or substantial and significant experience with, classical or traditional architecture; (ii) create the position of senior advisor for architectural design, for an individual with specialized experience in classical architecture, to help develop GSA procedures, advise on architectural standards, and provide guidance during design evaluations or design juries; (iii) where the design of an applicable Federal public building is selected pursuant to a design-build competition under section 3309 of title 41, United States Code, list experience with classical or traditional architecture as specialized experience and technical competence in the phase-one solicitation, and give substantive weight to these factors when evaluating which offerors will be advanced to phase two; and (iv) consistent with sections 4302 and 4312 of title 5, United States Code, make advancing the purposes and implementing the policies of this order a critical performance element in the individual performance plans of the Chief Architect of GSA and appropriate subordinate employees in the GSA Public Buildings Service involved in selecting designs for applicable Federal public buildings (c) Where GSA intends to select a building design pursuant to a design competition, the Administrator shall actively recruit architectural firms and, as applicable, designers with experience in classical and traditional architecture to enter such competition and shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that multiple designs in such modes are advanced to the final evaluation round. (d) In the event the Administrator proposes to approve a design for a new applicable Federal public building that diverges from the preferred architecture set forth in subsection 2(a) of this order, including Brutalist or Deconstructivist architecture or any design derived from or related to these types of architecture, the Administrator shall notify the President through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy not less than 30 days before GSA could reject such design without incurring substantial expenditures. Such notification shall set forth the reasons the Administrator proposes to approve such design, including: (i) a detailed explanation of why the Administrator believes selecting such design is justified, with particular focus on whether such design is as beautiful and reflective of the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American system of self-government as alternative designs using preferred architecture; (ii) the total expected cost of adopting the proposed design, including estimated maintenance and replacement costs throughout its expected lifecycle; and (iii) a description of the designs using preferred architecture seriously considered for such project and the total expected cost of adopting such designs, including estimated maintenance and replacement costs throughout their expected lifecycles. Sec . 6 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the General Services Administration. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 28, 2025.

Tragically, one of the gravest threats to American lives is the drug overdose crisis, which has caused heartbreak and suffering on untold numbers of families. This Overdose Prevention Week, we remember those who lost their lives to overdose, we stand beside the families left to grieve, and we renew our solemn commitment to ending this epidemic once and for all. Under the previous administration, our country endured a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions on our southern border. Deadly drugs like fentanyl and other opioids flooded into our cities and towns, falling into the hands of our children, siblings, parents, friends, and neighbors, and leaving devastation in their wake. Over the past year, more than 80,000 of our fellow citizens have died from drug overdoses. Children have vanished from classrooms, parents from dinner tables, and entire neighborhoods have been shaken by unconscionable grief and sorrow. To combat this vicious assault on the American people, in July, I proudly signed into law the HALT Fentanyl Act, which classifies fentanyl-related compounds as Schedule I drugs. I also designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations &#8212; and with the passage of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill, we are expanding the southern border wall and deporting violent drug traffickers who prey on our Nation&#8217;s most vulnerable. I will continue to do everything in my power to protect children and families, end the scourge of drug addiction, and keep lethal substances out of our communities and out of the hands of our citizens. During this week, my Administration calls on every American to protect themselves and their families from the perils of drug overdose. Preserving our American inheritance depends on freedom from danger, freedom from harm, and freedom to lead long, safe, and vigorous lives. My Administration will never stop fighting to achieve a future that protects its citizens, defends its communities, and ensures that the American people are happy, healthy, and free. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 31 through September 6, 2025, as Overdose Prevention Week. I call upon my fellow Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, religious services, and other activities that raise awareness about the prescription opioid and drug overdose epidemic and to consider concrete follow-up activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

Investigations Into Use of Federal Grant Funds . Federal funding reviews by my Administration have revealed that taxpayer funds are being spent on grants with highly political overtones. In addition to being a wasteful, abusive, and potentially fraudulent use of the American people&#8217;s money, the possible use of Federal grants as slush funds for political and legislative advocacy raises serious legal concerns. Federal law places strict limitations on the use of Federal grant funds, and in many instances prohibits grantees from lobbying with appropriated funds or supporting political candidates or parties with grant funds. Therefore, consistent with my duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, I hereby direct the Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of executive departments and agencies, to investigate whether Federal grant funds are being used to illegally support lobbying activities (See, 31 U.S.C. 1352) and to take appropriate enforcement action. The Attorney General shall report to the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum on the progress of the investigation. Sec . 2 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq .), section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order: Section 1 . Background . On July 22, 2025, I announced a framework agreement between the United States and Japan (Agreement), which lays the foundation for a new era of United States-Japan trade relations grounded in principles of reciprocity and our shared national interests. The Agreement establishes a tariff framework that levels the playing field for American producers and accounts for American national security needs. In my judgment, the Agreement is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended; and Proclamation 10962 of July 30, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United States). The Agreement will reduce the United States trade deficit, boost the economy of the United States, and address the consequences of the United States trade deficit, including by strengthening the manufacturing and defense industrial base of the United States. Under the Agreement, the United States will apply a baseline 15 percent tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the United States.&nbsp; This new tariff framework, combined with expanded United States exports and investment-driven production, will help reduce the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall United States trade position. Japan, meanwhile, will provide American manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, food, energy, automobile, and industrial goods producers with breakthrough openings in market access across key sectors. Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75 percent increase of United States rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year. The Government of Japan is also working to accept for sale in Japan United States-manufactured and United States-safety-certified passenger vehicles without additional testing. Separately, Japan will purchase United States-made commercial aircraft, as well as United States defense equipment. Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States.&nbsp; These investments &#8212; which will be selected by the United States Government &#8212; will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations. In my judgment, I determine that the following actions are consistent with the national interest of the United States and are necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962. Sec . 2 . General Tariffs . (a) The additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to products of Japan shall be determined by a product&#8217;s current ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (&#8220;Column 1 Duty Rate&#8221;). For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate in the HTSUS that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the additional rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be zero percent. Treatment of specific or compound duty rates shall be identical to the treatment provided to products of the European Union as outlined in Executive Order 14326 of July 31, 2025 (Further Modifying the Reciprocal Tariff Rates). The duties described in this subsection shall apply in lieu of the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed on products of Japan under Executive Order 14257, as amended. (b)&nbsp; Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, shall continue to apply to products of Japan. (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation with the United States Trade Representative; the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission (ITC), shall determine whether modifications to the HTSUS are necessary or appropriate to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the&nbsp; Federal Register . (d)&nbsp; The tariffs set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall apply retroactively to products of Japan entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025. &nbsp;Any refunds shall be processed pursuant to applicable laws and CBP&#8217;s standard procedures for such refunds. (e) &nbsp;The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules for determining what are &#8220;products of Japan&#8221; for purposes of this section. Sec . 3 . Aerospace . (a) With respect to products of Japan that fall under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, except for unmanned aircraft, the tariffs imposed through the following Presidential actions and subsequent amendments to those actions shall no longer apply, as of the date of publication of the Federal Register notice described in subsection (b) of this section: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Order 14257, as amended; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;Proclamation 9704, as amended; (iii) &nbsp;Proclamation 9705, as amended; and (iv)&nbsp; &nbsp;Proclamation 10962. (b) &nbsp;Within 7 days of the date of publication of this order in the Federal Register , the Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the ITC and the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules for determining what are &#8220;products of Japan&#8221; for purposes of this section. Sec . 4 . Automobiles and Automobile Parts . (a) As of the date of publication of the Federal Register notice described in subsection (b) of this section, in lieu of the additional section 232 ad valorem duties imposed on products of Japan in Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended, the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to an automobile or automobile part that is a product of Japan and subject to duties under Proclamation 10908, as amended, shall be determined by the product&#8217;s Column 1 Duty Rate. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional automobile or automobile part section 232 ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the additional automobile or automobile part section 232 ad valorem rate of duty imposed shall be zero percent. (b) &nbsp;Within 7 days of the date of publication of this order in the Federal Register , the Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the ITC and the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section. (c) &nbsp;The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules for determining whether automobiles and automobile parts are &#8220;products of Japan&#8221; for purposes of this section. Sec . 5 . Products Not Subject to Reciprocal Tariffs . (a) To implement the terms of the Agreement, the Secretary is authorized to modify the reciprocal tariff rate imposed under Executive Order 14257, as amended, to zero percent for products of Japan that are natural resources unavailable (or unavailable at sufficient scale to satisfy domestic demand) in the United States, generic pharmaceuticals, generic pharmaceutical ingredients, and generic pharmaceutical chemical precursors. (b) &nbsp;In determining when and for which products to modify the reciprocal tariff rate to zero percent, the Secretary shall act in a manner consistent with the national interests of the United States; the purposes of this order; the need to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended; and the need to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security that I found pursuant to section 232.&nbsp; The Secretary shall also consider factors he deems appropriate, including the scope and nature of the commitments of the Government of Japan under the Agreement; the scope and nature of the commitments of the United States under the Agreement; the actions taken by the Government of Japan to implement its commitments under the Agreement; and the actions taken by the United States to implement its commitments under the Agreement. Sec . 6 . Monitoring and Modifications . (a) The Secretary shall monitor the progress of Japan&#8217;s implementation of its commitments under the Agreement and shall, from time to time, update me on the status of Japan&#8217;s implementation. (b)&nbsp; Should Japan fail to implement its commitments under the Agreement, I may modify this order as necessary to deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962. Sec . 7 . Delegation . (a) Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security are directed and authorized to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order &#8212; including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or through notices in the Federal Register and by adopting rules, regulations, or guidance &#8212; and to employ all powers granted to the President, including those granted by IEEPA and section 232, as may be necessary to implement and effectuate this order. (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Chair of the ITC, shall determine whether additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register . &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with any senior officials she deems appropriate. (c) &nbsp;Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within their respective department or agency. (d) All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec . 8 . Interaction With Other Presidential Actions . Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions directed in this order is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. Sec . 9 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Purpose . The United States must strengthen efforts to protect U.S. nationals from wrongful detention abroad. The United States Government is committed to using every tool available to curb this coercive tactic used by foreign adversaries and must hold such adversaries to account. No American should fear being taken as a political pawn by rogue states. Wrongful detentions are an affront to the rule of law and aim to undermine our leadership on the world stage. The United States will not tolerate these attacks on our sovereignty and U.S. nationals. Sec . 2 . Designation . The Secretary of State may designate any foreign country the government of which directly engages in or provides support for the wrongful detention of a U.S. national as a State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention based on one or more of the following criteria: (a) &nbsp;the wrongful detention of a U.S. national occurs in the foreign country; (b) &nbsp;the government of the foreign country has failed to release a wrongfully detained U.S. national after having been notified by the United States that the detention has been determined wrongful by the Secretary of State;&nbsp;or (c) &nbsp;actions taken by the government of the foreign country indicate, based on the totality of the circumstances: (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;that the government is responsible for, complicit in, or materially supports the wrongful detention of a U.S. national; or (ii) &nbsp;a pattern in which the government is responsible for, complicit in, or materially supports the unjust or unlawful detention of third country nationals in which cases the United States has a national interest, using criteria similar to those used by the Department of State in wrongful detention determinations.&nbsp; Sec . 3 .

Sec . 4 . Termination of Designation .

Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 11:53 min Learn more Share full article 407 By Robert Draper Reporting from Washington Sept. 9, 2025 Until a month or two ago, Nicholas J. Fuentes was regarded by right-wing influencers as a mosquito-like interloper whose lifeblood was attention. Ignore his openly racist and sexist rants, their thinking went, and Mr. Fuentes would eventually flitter off into oblivion. But today an entirely different consensus has emerged on the right. The footprint of the oratorically proficient late-night streaming show host has not dwindled in the least, with his tens if not hundreds of thousands of alienated young male conservatives followers known as Groypers, a nickname derived from an alt-right meme. If anything, his anti-Israel, anti-immigrant, anti-transgender and anti-civil-rights views seem to have gained new currency during the second Trump administration. There is now growing alarm among leading conservatives about Mr. Fuentes, who routinely tests the cultlike devotion of his young male fans by savaging their patriarchal figure, President Trump, for not being right-wing enough. In the process, he has emerged as one of the loudest voices on the right to turn on the president. “When I was a teenager, I thought he was a Caesar-like figure who was going to save Western civilization,” Mr. Fuentes, 27, said in an interview. “Now I view him as incompetent, corrupt and compromised.” Specifically, he has criticized the president for showing solidarity with Israel over the war in Gaza, for refusing to release the Epstein files and for considering extending student visas to Chinese nationals. On Labor Day, Mr. Fuentes posted on social media, “Trump 2.0 has been a disappointment in literally every way but nobody wants to admit it.” Asked to comment on Mr. Fuentes’s remarks, White House officials declined. Current and former members of the Trump administration as well as outside advisers would not be quoted for the record about Mr. Fuentes out of fear, they said, of inviting online attacks from him and his zealous followers. Three of them mentioned the sudden ubiquity of Fuentes-related clips circulating in their social media feeds. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Nick Fuentes Says His Followers ‘Framed’ In Charlie Kirk Shooting. By Ty Roush , Forbes Staff. Ty Roush is a breaking news reporter based in New York City. Follow Author Sep 13, 2025, 05:08pm EDT Sep 14, 2025, 03:31am EDT Share Save Comment Topline Nick Fuentes has denied speculation circulating on social media his followers, known as “Groypers,” were responsible for conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s death, after messages on unfired casings written by Kirk’s alleged shooter Tyler Robinson appeared to be linked to the far-right movement. Social media users speculated whether a suspect arrested in Kirk’s fatal shooting was linked to the white nationalist’s following. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. Key Facts Groypers appeared to emerge as a far-right political movement in 2019 as followers of Fuentes, with similar beliefs to other alt-right and white supremacist groups and grounded in traditional Christian values, characterizing themselves as “American nationalists,&quot; according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. The group is named after a racist-coded version of the “Pepe” meme affiliated with the alt-right, which members use online to clash with other conservatives. In 2019, Fuentes ordered his followers to target question-and-answer events held by conservatives who aligned with President Donald Trump, including a series of events hosted by Kirk, during which Fuentes and his followers heckled crowdgoers and hurled homophobic and antisemitic questions. Kirk was often targeted by Groypers, who believed Kirk’s political beliefs leaned too moderate. Fuentes and his followers have since been banned from attending Turning Point USA events and the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, and Fuentes has often held a competing conference, the America First Political Action Conference, featuring speakers including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , R-Ga., former Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin and Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers , a Republican, among others. A number of Groypers were identified as rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to congressional testimony by Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. What Are Tyler Robinson’s Alleged Ties To Groypers? Law enforcement recovered bullet casings near a rifle they believe was used to fatally shoot Kirk earlier this week, some of which includes symbology suggesting Robinson was part of the Groyper movement, Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Reuters. There is currently no definitive link between Robinson, Groypers or Fuentes, however. One message read, “O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!” in an apparent reference to an antifascist anthem sung by Italians after World War II, though some social media users noted a version of the song appears on a Spotify playlist meant for Groypers, the New York Times reported . Others pointed to a Facebook photo in which Robinson appeared to reference a Groyper meme. Chief Critic Fuentes disputed claims that Groypers were to blame for the shooting, writing on X Saturday: “My followers and I are currently being framed for the murder of Charlie Kirk by the mainstream media based on literally zero evidence.” In a separate video, Fuentes, who noted he was often in opposition to Kirk, told Groypers: “To all of my followers, if you take up arms, I disavow you,” adding, “I disown you in the strongest possible terms.” What Do We Know About Tyler Robinson’s Political Beliefs? Robinson was unaffiliated with any party, and voter records indicate Robinson was considered “inactive,” meaning he did not vote in the 2024 presidential election, his first since turning 18, the New York Times reported . One of Robinson’s relatives told law enforcement that Robinson became “more political” in recent years, though other details about his political affiliations are not known. His parents are registered as Republicans, according to the Times. What Are The Beliefs Held By Groypers? Groypers view traditional conservatism as being too moderate and believe shifting racial and cultural demographics pose an existential threat to white Americans, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Groypers believe the U.S. should close its borders, are opposed to liberal values, feminism and LGBTQ+ rights, arguing conservatives—including the late Kirk and Trump—should lean further to the right. Last year, Fuentes said he declared “war” against Trump’s presidential campaign, after earlier opposing Trump’s support of Israel. Key Background Robinson, 22, was arrested late Thursday in connection with the fatal shooting of Kirk earlier in the week. Robinson, who has yet to be formally charged, was taken into custody after confessing or suggesting to committing the killing to a family member, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Friday. He was identified in video surveillance footage from Utah Valley University, where Kirk’s Turning Point USA was holding the first of a nationwide college tour, and then arrested near St. George, Utah, according to Cox. Robinson told family members about Kirk coming to the state ahead of his visit to Utah Valley University, and Robinson and his family talked about why they “didn’t like [Kirk] and the viewpoints that he had.” Kirk, a right-wing political activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, rose in popularity while hosting his daily radio show, “The Charlie Kirk Show,” and appearing as a voice in culture wars on college campuses. He was lauded by Trump and other Republicans for aiding Trump’s presidential campaigns, and Trump has said he would posthumously award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

His alleged killer, identified as Tyler Robinson (22), was apprehended a day later after a family intervention and remains in custody facing charges of attempted aggravated murder. According to the Daily Mail , his grandmother, Debbie Robinson, described the family as “staunch Trump supporters.” She stated that her son – Tyler’s father, Matt Robinson – is a Republican “for Trump,” and that she didn’t know “any single one [in the family] who’s a Democrat.” The family’s reaction, as reported, was one of shock and intervention. The Daily Mail reported that it was Tyler’s father who turned him in after he allegedly confessed. The Daily Beast added that Matt Robinson recognised his son in law enforcement images and urged him to surrender. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that, while both his parents are registered Republicans, Tyler himself was registered as a nonpartisan voter.&nbsp; Robinson was admitted to Utah State University on a prestigious academic scholarship, a moment of pride captured in a video of him reading his acceptance letter posted to a family member’s social media account. However, his tenure there was fleeting. A university spokesperson confirmed he attended for only a single semester in 2021.&nbsp; After leaving Utah State, Robinson’s path turned away from the academic and toward the vocational. He enrolled at Dixie Technical College, a small school in southern Utah near his family’s home in Washington City.&nbsp; Described as a “shy, quiet kid” Robinson was a third-year student in the college’s electrical apprenticeship program at the time of his arrest, training to become an electrician, lighting technician, or repair specialist. A family member also told authorities that Tyler “had become more political in recent years” and had expressed negative views of Kirk before the event. The Guardian &#8216;s report that a high school friend recalled Robinson was a &#8220;leftist&#8221; has since been removed. A Halloween Costume and the &#8216;Groyper&#8217; Meme Though there are few direct political statements online from this &#8220;shy, quiet kid”, there are more indications that Tyler Robinson might have been radicalised by far-right online movements rather than the far left. An image posted by his mother, Amberson Robinson, on Facebook around Halloween 2018, describes her son as “some guy from a meme” and shows Robinson squatting on some grass. The uniform is precise – Adidas-style track pants – and the pose is significant, a meme that became known as a low ‘Slav squat’. By 2018, this ‘Gopnik’ aesthetic – the squat, the tracksuit – had fully converged with the ‘Pepe the Frog’ meme in the alt-right online sphere. The ‘Gopnik Pepe’ was common currency on 4chan and adjacent platforms, a symbol of a certain nihilistic, post-Soviet edge.&nbsp;It then evolved into many variants. To understand the potential significance of Robinson’s 2018 costume, one must trace the complex genealogy of its symbols. The journey begins with Pepe the Frog, an apolitical comic character co-opted by the alt-right around 2015-2016. By September 2016, the Anti-Defamation League had designated certain variants of Pepe a hate symbol. Its march into the mainstream was confirmed in 2017 when a Pepe emoji trended heavily during the Super Bowl. This period of 2016-2018 saw the ‘Gopnik squat’ meme merge with Pepe, creating the ‘Gopnik Pepe’ – a symbol of defiant, low-life resistance that resonated deeply within the nihilistic communities of 4chan. This is the exact cultural moment Robinson’s Halloween costume inhabits. By 2018-2019, this meme culture crystallised into a formal political project with the rise of Nick Fuentes. A new, chubbier frog variant called the ‘ Groyper ’ – a portmanteau of ‘frog’ and ‘grouper’ fish – became the namesake for Fuentes’s network of white nationalist, Christian nationalist activists. Their goal: to tug mainstream U.S. conservatism sharply to the far right. This strategy erupted into public view in the autumn of 2019 during the ‘Groyper Wars’. Fuentes’s followers, organised online, systematically disrupted events hosted by Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA (TPUSA), confronting speakers with loaded questions on immigration , Israel , and LGBT rights designed to ‘expose’ them as insufficiently ‘America First’.&nbsp; Incidents at Ohio State (October 29, 2019) and the heckling Donald Trump Jr. at a promotional event for his book Triggered at UCLA that November cemented the Groyper identity: a fusion of memes and coordinated real-world action aimed squarely at figures like Kirk, whom they branded as ‘Conservative Inc.’ sell-outs. By 2020, Fuentes had turned this meme-driven network into a sustained media and political infrastructure under the ‘America First’ banner, complete with an annual conference (AFPAC) and a thriving livestream community. Concierge Nationalism: How the Far-Right Is Selling Extremism as a Lifestyle Service Vigilantes with links to Neo-Nazi groups are whipping up fear about migrants while soliciting donations for accompanying children to supposed safety Dan Evans &#8216;Bella Ciao&#8217; Though the only evidence so far of Robinson’s allegiance to the Groyper movement is seven years old, and made murky by the deliberately coded and ironic nature of evolving memes, one bit of new evidence suggests the Halloween image might be important. Police recovered a Mauser Model 98 rifle in a nearby wooded area soon after Charlie Kirk’s murder. Utah’s Governor, Spencer Cox, later confirmed that unfired casings carried bizarre inscriptions. These included: “Hey fascist! Catch!” (a line from the Tarantino movie Inglorious Basterds ) is featured along with arrows which reference the multiplayer video game Helldivers, and various imperatives with the word &#8216;fascist&#8217; are memes in the Helldivers community , which is popular with the far right community. The gun casing engravings included some other classic internet trolling motifs &#8211; “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO” “notices bulge OWO what’s this?” &#8211; and a single line: &#8220;Bella Ciao.” “Bella Ciao” is a 20th-century Italian folk song that became the anthem of the anti-fascist Resistance during the Second World War. Its lyrics – “O bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao! – are a mournful yet defiant farewell to a life of freedom, sung by a partisan who is fighting and expects to die for the cause of liberation from fascism. After the song gained global recognition from its feature in the Netflix series Money Heist, the Groyper movement co-opted it.&nbsp; A HUGEL remix of “Bella Ciao” was included in a leaked ‘Groyper Wars playlist’ which provided the definitive soundtrack and curated set of signals for the movement. The song is also featured in Hearts of Iron, another online war game popular on the far right. An X account named “ AF Ciao Bella &#8221; — a direct fusion of Fuentes’s &#8216;America First&#8217; brand and the meme — suggests these symbols were often integrated into the group’s identity. By reportedly engraving this message on his unused shell casings, Tyler Robinson&#8217;s messages suggest he could well have been inspired by the Groyper movement or other far-right influences. But only a full investigation by the authorities will determine the suspected killer&#8217;s motivations.

Inconsistencies may occur. ✖ The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has reignited attention on a long-simmering feud within elements of the far right, particularly between Kirk and the so-called ""Groyper"" movement led by white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 during an appearance at Utah Valley University . As authorities investigate the motive , online speculation has turned toward extremist factions that once targeted Kirk&mdash;specifically, Fuentes' ""Groyper Army,"" which has long accused him of being insufficiently radical. Despite his confrontational style, Kirk was frequently attacked from the right for being too moderate. During the 2019 ""Groyper Wars,"" Fuentes' supporters disrupted Turning Point USA events, challenging Kirk on immigration and LGBTQ rights while labeling him a ""gatekeeper"" of establishment conservatism. Now, as the public searches for answers in Kirk's assassination, that conflict within far-right is back in the spotlight&mdash;with renewed scrutiny on the rhetoric and influence of Fuentes and his followers. Social media users have also questioned whether early claims by officials that the suspect, apprehended late Thursday, was tied to left-wing extremism were premature, pointing instead to possible links to the far-right. As of Friday afternoon, it remained unclear what the motive was in the Kirk shooting, or the political ideology of the alleged gunman. Robinson's family said he had become ""more political"" in recent years, according to police. The markings on the bullet casings suggest the subject was steeped in meme culture and made references to online taunts and anti-fascist messages. Their mascot is a cartoon frog called ""Groyper,"" a variant of the Pepe meme used widely among extremist groups. Their mascot is a cartoon frog called ""Groyper,"" a variant of the Pepe meme used widely among extremist groups. X / YouTube What Is the Groyper Army? The Groyper Army is a far-right, online-based movement organized around white nationalist and ""America First"" advocate Nick Fuentes. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the group consists of ""alt-right, white nationalist, and Christian nationalist activists"" who hold virulently antisemitic, racist, and homophobic views, often cloaked in rhetoric about traditional values and family. Their mascot is a cartoon frog called ""Groyper,"" a variant of the ""Pepe"" meme used widely among extremist groups. When Did the Term 'Groyper' Begin? The term ""Groyper"" began circulating widely in 2019 during a public feud inside the conservative movement. That year, followers of Nick Fuentes disrupted college events hosted by Charlie Kirk and his group, Turning Point USA, accusing Kirk of watering down Donald Trump 's message. The clash, later referred to as the ""Groyper Wars,"" drew national attention for its confrontational tactics and for pushing white nationalist ideas into more mainstream conservative circles. Kirk responded by calling the Groypers extremists. He defended his approach to conservatism as inclusive, saying the movement should be open to people of all backgrounds and reject racism and homophobia. What Has Nick Fuentes Said About the Charlie Kirk Killing? Fuentes has made several public statements about Kirk's assassination. Shortly after the killing, Fuentes posted, ""I am devastated. It feels like a nightmare that we'll never wake up from,"" and called for unity, writing, ""The violence and hatred has to stop. Our country needs Christ now more than ever."" On September 12, Fuentes directed his comments at the Trump administration. ""We need more from the Trump administration than what we're getting,"" he wrote on X. ""Release all the information about the assassin and his Discord contacts. Everyone must be investigated. Tell us the plan. How will the government stop this from ever happening again? Where is the leadership???"" Nick Fuentes, far right activist, holds a rally at the Lansing Capitol, in Lansing, Mich., Wednesday, Nov. 11, 2020.

Background . The city of Memphis, Tennessee, is suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government&#8217;s ability to respond effectively. This situation has become dire in one of our Nation&#8217;s most historic cities. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memphis in 2024 had the highest rate of violent crime per capita, including some of the highest per capita rates of murder, robbery, and aggravated assault, and property crimes such as burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft, in the country. The city, a beacon of American culture that was Elvis&#8217;s home and is often called the birthplace of rock and roll and the blues, should be safe and secure for all of its citizens and Americans who visit its historic landmarks such as Graceland, Beale Street, and the Memphis Pyramid. To restore public safety and order, State and local leaders have requested Federal assistance, and I will act quickly to ensure that Federal authorities assist Memphis law enforcement to the fullest possible extent. Sec . 2 . Memphis Safe Task Force . (a) There is hereby established a Memphis Safe Task Force (Task Force), whose objective shall be to end street and violent crime in Memphis to the greatest possible extent through the promotion and facilitation of hypervigilant policing, aggressive prosecution, complex investigations, financial enforcement, and large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel, and which shall coordinate closely with State officials in Tennessee and local officials in Memphis to share information, develop joint priorities, and maximize resources to make Memphis safe and restore public order. The Task Force shall be chaired by an individual selected and appointed by the Attorney General, who shall direct all Task Force functions and who shall coordinate with the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor. The Task Force shall also include representatives from the following executive departments and agencies (agencies), as designated by the head of the relevant agency: (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Department of the Treasury; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Department of War; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; the Department of Justice; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Department of Health and Human Services; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Department of Housing and Urban Development; (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Department of Transportation; (vii)&nbsp;&nbsp; the Department of Homeland Security; (viii)&nbsp; the United States Marshals Service; (ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; (x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; (xi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Drug Enforcement Administration; (xii)&nbsp;&nbsp; Homeland Security Investigations; and (xiii)&nbsp; the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Western District of Tennessee. (b) &nbsp;The Chairman of the Task Force may also designate other agencies to participate in the Task Force as the Chairman deems necessary, as well as Inspectors General from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the United States Postal Service, the Small Business Administration, and such other agencies as the Chairman of the Task Force determines.&nbsp; The head of an agency designated by the Chairman shall select a representative of the agency to serve on the Task Force. (c) The Task Force may, to the extent permitted by law, request operational assistance from and coordinate with the Memphis Police Department, the Tennessee Highway Patrol, the Memphis Area Transit Authority, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, the Tennessee Alcohol Beverage Commission, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, the Tennessee State Probation and Parole Office, the Tennessee Department of Corrections, the Arkansas State Police, the Mississippi State Police, the Shelby County Attorney&#8217;s Office, the Shelby County District Attorney&#8217;s Office, the Memphis City Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Shelby County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, Shelby County Pretrial Services, the Shelby County Probation Section, and other Federal, State, and local officials as appropriate. (d) The Task Force shall utilize the strategies and principles of Federal, State, and local law enforcement coordination developed and deployed pursuant to Executive Order 14252 of March 27, 2025 (Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful), and Executive Order 14333 of August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia), as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to coordinate and ensure effective integrated action by Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities to address extensive and pervasive criminal activity and reduce crime in Memphis; enforce Federal immigration law; provide the Memphis Police Department with assistance to facilitate the recruitment, retention, and enhancement of capabilities of its police officers; dramatically increase the Federal, State, and local law enforcement presence and Federal coordination with State and local law enforcement, as appropriate; and coordinate strict enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety laws, including those laws prohibiting assault, battery, larceny, graffiti and other vandalism, unpermitted disturbances and demonstrations, noise, trespassing, public intoxication, drug possession, sale, vagrancy and use, and traffic violations, to make Memphis safe and secure again. (e) &nbsp;The Task Force shall report to me as necessary through the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor regarding safety in Memphis and the tasks set forth in subsection (d) of this section. &nbsp;As part of this reporting, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Task Force, shall assess whether public-safety circumstances in Memphis require additional executive action. Sec . 3 . Mobilizing the National Guard to Protect Memphis . (a) The Secretary of War shall request that the Governor of Tennessee, under section 502 of title 32, United States Code, make available National Guard units of Tennessee to support public safety and law enforcement operations in Memphis, in such numbers and for such duration as the Governor may deem necessary and appropriate to assist with the activities of the Task Force.

RESTRICTION ON ENTRY OF CERTAIN NONIMMIGRANT WORKERS,PROCLAMATION,19/09/2025,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/,"Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers &#8211; The White House Menu President Donald J.

The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time. Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2019. And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa. Information technology (IT) firms in particular have prominently manipulated the H-1B system, significantly harming American workers in computer-related fields. The share of IT workers in the H-1B program grew from 32 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 to an average of over 65 percent in the last 5 fiscal years. In addition, some of the most prolific H-1B employers are now consistently IT outsourcing companies. Using these H 1B-reliant IT outsourcing companies provides significant savings for employers: one study of tech workers showed a 36 percent discount for H-1B &#8220;entry-level&#8221; positions as compared to full-time, traditional workers. To take advantage of artificially low labor costs incentivized by the program, companies close their IT divisions, fire their American staff, and outsource IT jobs to lower-paid foreign workers. Further, the abuse of the H-1B visa program has made it even more challenging for college graduates trying to find IT jobs, allowing employers to hire foreign workers at a significant discount to American workers. These effects of abuse of H-1B visas have coincided with increasing challenges in the labor market in which H-1B workers serve. According to a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among college graduates ages 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates in the country at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively &#8212; more than double the unemployment rates of recent biology and art history graduates. Recent data reveals that unemployment rates among workers in computer occupations jumped from an average of 1.98 percent in 2019 to 3.02 percent in 2025. Reports also indicate that many American tech companies have laid off their qualified and highly skilled American workers and simultaneously hired thousands of H-1B workers. One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. American IT workers have reported they were forced to train the foreign workers who were taking their jobs and to sign nondisclosure agreements about this indignity as a condition of receiving any form of severance. This suggests H-1B visas are not being used to fill occupational shortages or obtain highly skilled workers who are unavailable in the United States. The high numbers of relatively low-wage workers in the H-1B program undercut the integrity of the program and are detrimental to American workers&#8217; wages and labor opportunities, especially at the entry level, in industries where such low-paid H-1B workers are concentrated. These abuses also prevent American employers in other industries from utilizing the H-1B program in the manner in which it was intended: to fill jobs for which highly skilled and educated American workers are unavailable. The abuse of the H-1B program is also a national security threat. Domestic law enforcement agencies have identified and investigated H-1B-reliant outsourcing companies for engaging in visa fraud, conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other illicit activities to encourage foreign workers to come to the United States. Further, abuses of the H-1B program present a national security threat by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology, risking American leadership in these fields. A 2017 study showed that wages for American computer scientists would have been 2.6 percent to 5.1 percent higher and employment in computer science for American workers would have been 6.1 percent to 10.8 percent higher in 2001 absent the importation of foreign workers into the computer science field. It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers. The severe harms that the large-scale abuse of this program has inflicted on our economic and national security demands an immediate response. I therefore find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of certain foreign workers who are described in section 1 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States because such entry would harm American workers, including by undercutting their wages. Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1 . Restriction on Entry . (a) Pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), the entry into the United States of aliens as nonimmigrants to perform services in a specialty occupation under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), is restricted, except for those aliens whose petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a payment of $100,000 &#8212; subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section. This restriction shall expire, absent extension, 12 months after the effective date of this proclamation, which shall be 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall restrict decisions on petitions not accompanied by a $100,000 payment for H-1B specialty occupation workers under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the INA, who are currently outside the United States, for 12 months following the effective date of this proclamation as set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The Secretary of State shall also issue guidance, as necessary and to the extent permitted by law, to prevent misuse of B visas by alien beneficiaries of approved H-1B petitions that have an employment start date beginning prior to October 1, 2026. (c) The restriction imposed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply to any individual alien, all aliens working for a company, or all aliens working in an industry, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the Secretary&#8217;s discretion, that the hiring of such aliens to be employed as H-1B specialty occupation workers is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. Sec . 2 . Compliance . (a) Employers shall, prior to filing an H-1B petition on behalf of an alien outside the United States, obtain and retain documentation showing that the payment described in section 1 of this proclamation has been made. (b) The Secretary of State shall verify receipt of payment of the amount described in section 1 of this proclamation during the H-1B visa petition process and shall approve only those visa petitions for which the filing employer has made the payment described in section 1 of this proclamation. (c) The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State shall coordinate to take all necessary and appropriate action to implement this proclamation and to deny entry to the United States to any H-1B nonimmigrant for whom the prospective employer has not made the payment described in section 1 of this proclamation. Sec . 3 . Scope and Implementation of Restriction on Entry . (a) The restriction on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall apply only to aliens who enter or attempt to enter the United States after the effective date of this proclamation as set forth in section 1(a) of this proclamation. (b) No later than 30 days following the completion of the H-1B lottery that immediately follows this proclamation, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall jointly submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, a recommendation on whether an extension or renewal of the restriction on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation is in the interests of the United States. Sec . 4 . Amending the Prevailing Wage Levels . (a) The Secretary of Labor shall initiate a rulemaking to revise the prevailing wage levels to levels consistent with the policy goals of this proclamation consistent with section 212(n) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(n). (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall initiate a rulemaking to prioritize the admission as nonimmigrants of high-skilled and high-paid aliens, consistent with sections 101, 212, and 214 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101, 1182, and 1184. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Antifa as a Terrorist Threat . Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law. It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals. This campaign involves coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists. Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members. Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech. This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism. Sec . 2 . Designation as a Domestic Terrorist Organization . Because of the aforementioned pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law, I hereby designate Antifa as a &#8220;domestic terrorist organization.&#8221; All relevant executive departments and agencies shall utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations &#8212; especially those involving terrorist actions &#8212; conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support, including necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund such operations. Sec . 3 . General Provisions . (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

For the Peruvian footballer, see Nicolás Fuentes . Nick Fuentes Fuentes in 2022 Born Nicholas Joseph Fuentes ( 1998-08-18 ) August 18, 1998 (age&#160;27) &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 2 &#93; Chicago , Illinois, U.S. &#91; 3 &#93; Occupations Political commentator streamer Years&#160;active 2015–present Known&#160;for Political commentary Founder of the Groypers Hate speech Movement White nationalism &#91; 4 &#93; Christian nationalism &#91; 5 &#93; ( see below ) Nicholas Joseph Fuentes (born August 18, 1998) is an American far-right &#91; 6 &#93; political commentator , activist, live streamer and leader of the Groypers who promotes white supremacist , &#91; 7 &#93; misogynistic , &#91; 8 &#93; &#91; 9 &#93; homophobic , &#91; 9 &#93; and antisemitic views. Fuentes has promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories against Jews , called for a "" holy war "" against them, &#91; 10 &#93; &#91; 11 &#93; and has denied the Holocaust . &#91; 12 &#93; He has been described as a neo-Nazi by various sources. &#91; 13 &#93; &#91; 14 &#93; &#91; 15 &#93; Fuentes identifies as a member of the incel movement , &#91; 16 &#93; a supporter of authoritarianism , an integralist , and a Christian nationalist . &#91; 5 &#93; &#91; 17 &#93; Fuentes was raised in La Grange Park, Illinois , and studied at Lyons Township High School where he embraced far-right conservative views. He began political activism in 2016 and started the episodic live stream America First in 2017. Collaborating with Patrick Casey, a former leader of the neo-Nazi organization Identity Evropa in 2019, Fuentes' followers began to heckle Charlie Kirk and his organization Turning Point USA 's Culture War Tour, including a speaking event for Donald Trump Jr. This is referred to as the Groyper War . In 2020, seeking to establish a white supremacist conference to rival the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Fuentes began holding the annual America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC). In November 2022, Fuentes and the American rapper Kanye West had a private dinner with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago . The meeting was broadly condemned by American political commentators, with The New York Times describing it as ""what may be the most discomfiting moment in U.S. history in a half-century or more"" for American Jews . &#91; 6 &#93; In January 2024, Fuentes said he was a ""Trump cultist "". &#91; 18 &#93; Fuentes became more critical of Donald Trump that year, partly due to his immigration, foreign affairs, and race policies. &#91; 19 &#93; In August 2024, Nick Fuentes launched "" Groyper War 2 ,"" a ""digital war"" against Trump's presidential campaign involving memes, trolls, and protests to push for more extreme right-wing positions, unsuccessful demands to fire advisors Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles , and withholding votes, crediting his efforts for Trump's rehiring of Corey Lewandowski while drawing concerns over potential election interference blueprints due to lax platform enforcement. &#91; 20 &#93; In 2025, Fuentes said Trump was a ""scam artist"" due to his comments about the Epstein files . &#91; 21 &#93; &#91; 14 &#93; Fuentes has been involved in a number of controversial events. Fuentes attended the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville , and was also an attendee and speaker at events preceding the January 6 United States Capitol attack . Fuentes faced widespread deplatforming from major social media, streaming, and financial services between 2020 and 2023, primarily for violating hate speech policies and inciting violence. In 2023, Fuentes was criticized for allegedly covering for a friend's sexual misconduct with underage boys, reportedly pressuring an accuser to apologize. In November 2024, after his home was doxed, he was arrested for battery for pepper-spraying and pushing an activist, taking her phone. In December 2024, Fuentes survived an apparent assassination attempt at his home by a 24-year-old, who was killed by police after a shootout. Early life and family Nicholas Joseph Fuentes was born on August 18, 1998, &#91; 1 &#93; in Chicago, Illinois, &#91; 3 &#93; to William and Lauren ( née &#160;Chicco ). &#91; 22 &#93; He has a sister. &#91; 23 &#93; According to Fuentes, he is of Italian , Irish and Mexican descent. &#91; 24 &#93; &#91; 25 &#93; &#91; 26 &#93; &#91; 27 &#93; He grew up in La Grange Park, Illinois . He attended Lyons Township High School , where he embraced far-right conservative views and was president of the student council. &#91; 28 &#93; Family's influence and views His parents have been noted to share racist views through their son's accounts and direct participation in his livestreams. His mother appeared on his podcast in December 2021, where she made anti-Black comments about a shooting at Oakbrook Center , asking ""What flavor do you think it was?"" and asserting it was a ""gang shooting,"" while questioning the lack of shooter information, implying racial stereotypes about crime; he referenced a racist conspiracy theory suggesting media delays in identifying non-white perpetrators, to which his mother agreed with ""Yep, yep."" &#91; 22 &#93; When he noted to his mother: ""How long did that take before you’re calling out Blacks, you’re calling out k****,” [a slur for Jewish people],"" and then asked ""Where do I get it."" His mother responded, ""I have no idea, you get it from your dad."" Fuentes has described his father's aversion to restaurants like Applebee's and Red Lobster , calling them ""black fare"" and recalling family refusals to eat there, with his father stating ""we will never eat at Applebee's"" and ""not in a million years should you be caught dead"" at such places. &#91; 29 &#93; He also mentioned, before his birth, a family saying about Olive Garden containing the N-word, linking it to perceived associations with Black people. &#91; 29 &#93; College education He studied introductory international relations and politics during his freshman year at Boston University . &#91; 16 &#93; He dropped out in 2017 after completing his freshman year, stating that he received threats for attending the white supremacist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia . &#91; 9 &#93; &#91; 30 &#93; &#91; 31 &#93; At the urging of his parents, who initially encouraged him to pursue conventional paths like employment or college, Fuentes proposed a deal: they would allow him one year to explore his propaganda venture from their basement, with the promise to abandon it if it failed. His parents agreed, providing the space and time for him to develop his platform, which he did. &#91; 22 &#93; He said he would transfer to Auburn University in fall 2017, saying Auburn ""has better weather and better people"" but ultimately ""did not confirm his enrollment"". &#91; 32 &#93; He told the United States House Select January 6th Committee that he received an associate's degree from College of DuPage . &#91; 33 &#93; Streaming operations Fuentes initally live-streamed from the basement of his parents' home for at least four years, a setting central to his public persona as a "" NEET "" (not in employment, education, or training) or a Disconnected youth . &#91; 22 &#93; He relocated his livestreaming operations from his parents' basement to an apartment in Berwyn, Illinois , in November 2020. Despite telling viewers he was still working from his parents’ home, police records and neighbor accounts suggest he operated from the Berwyn property. His father frequently oversaw renovations at the complex, particularly on the second floor, where Fuentes established a new podcasting studio. &#91; 22 &#93; Career Early activities Fuentes began commentating on politics through a local radio and TV station hosted by his high school, where he espoused mainstream conservative views. &#91; 34 &#93; &#91; 35 &#93; He hosts the episodic live stream America First with Nicholas J. Fuentes , which he began in 2017 during his freshman year at Boston University. &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 16 &#93; &#91; 37 &#93; &#91; 38 &#93; America First is characterized by Fuentes' frequent use of jokes and irony to appeal to Generation Z while providing plausible deniability for his often extreme views. &#91; 39 &#93; Fuentes cites the candidacy and presidency of Donald Trump as an inspiration for America First . &#91; 9 &#93; On his show in April 2017, Fuentes asserted that Muslim speech was not covered by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and went on to say, ""Who runs the media? Globalists. Time to kill the globalists"" and ""I want people that run CNN to be arrested and deported or hanged because this is deliberate."" The publisher of the show at the time, Right Side Broadcasting Network , issued an apology, calling the comments ""unacceptable"" and ""inappropriate"". &#91; 40 &#93; Following these and other comments, as well as publicity over his attendance at the Unite the Right rally , he left RSBN in August 2017. &#91; 32 &#93; &#91; 41 &#93; In February 2022, Fuentes claimed that he was fired by RSBN CEO Joe Seales. &#91; 16 &#93; He co-hosted the Nationalist Review podcast with another white nationalist, James Allsup , until January 2018. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , ""the two had a public falling out with each host accusing the other of laziness, impropriety and a variety of petty slights."" &#91; 42 &#93; In April 2018, Fuentes spoke at the American Renaissance conference. &#91; 16 &#93; America First Political Action Conference Main article: America First Political Action Conference Logo of America First with Nicholas J. Fuentes Fuentes has been supported by the conservative commentator Michelle Malkin , who agreed to speak at his first annual America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC) in February 2020 and again at his second conference in February 2021. &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 43 &#93; &#91; 44 &#93; &#91; 45 &#93; In November 2019, Malkin was fired by the Young America's Foundation after 17 years of employment over her support for Fuentes. &#91; 46 &#93; &#91; 47 &#93; Fuentes hosted his second annual AFPAC event in February 2021, speaking alongside Malkin and the politicians Steve King and Paul Gosar . &#91; 44 &#93; Later that month, he was barred from the Hyatt Regency Orlando, where he attempted to ""start a commotion"" on the CPAC floor. &#91; 48 &#93; Fuentes was again removed from CPAC in July 2021 for harassing a journalist. &#91; 49 &#93; &#91; 50 &#93; At an event held across the street, he said that now that he is banned from Twitter, ""I have nothing to lose. This is going to be the most racist, sexist, antisemitic, Holocaust-denying speech in all of Dallas this weekend."" &#91; 49 &#93; Fuentes hosted his third annual AFPAC event in February 2022. Marjorie Taylor Greene , the U.S. representative for Georgia's 14th district , attended the conference, &#91; 51 &#93; &#91; 52 &#93; while Janice McGeachin , then the lieutenant governor of Idaho , and Gosar prerecorded videos that were played at the event. &#91; 53 &#93; This was criticized, including by other Republican Party politicians such as Mitt Romney . Greene later said that she did not know who the organizers of the conference were. &#91; 54 &#93; AFPAC 2024 was cancelled by the venue, but they held an alternative event, also attended by Sulaiman Ahmed, an online anti-Israel commentator, and David Duke , formerly of the Ku Klux Klan . &#91; 55 &#93; &#91; 56 &#93; Groypers See also: Groypers Fuentes' show, America First , has attracted a cult following , which Fuentes refers to as the ""Groypers"" or the ""Groyper Army"". The Groyper movement was founded in 2019, which consists of primarily young, online activists known for their white nationalist, Christian nationalist, and alt-right views. Fuentes has encouraged the use of jokes and irony among white nationalist groups, stating that it ""is so important for giving a lot of cover and plausible deniability for our views"". &#91; 16 &#93; Operating through his ""America First"" livestream and platforms like X, Fuentes has organized the Groypers to challenge mainstream conservative figures, notably during the 2019 ""Groyper Wars,"" where they disrupted events hosted by Turning Point USA and others with provocative questions on immigration, Israel, and cultural issues. Fuentes has repeatedly criticized TPUSA and its founder, Charlie Kirk , accusing them of betraying Donald Trump by advocating in favor of mass legal immigration, support for foreign aid for Israel, and queer issues. &#91; 57 &#93; Groyper War Throughout October and November 2019, his supporters were present at many of Kirk's public speaking events, which featured guest speakers including Donald Trump Jr. , Lara Trump , and Kimberly Guilfoyle . &#91; 57 &#93; These campaigns frequently involved asking questions that prompted viewers to look up far-right and antisemitic conspiracy theories and hoaxes online. &#91; 58 &#93; Fuentes has characterized the campaign as a grassroots effort to expose TPUSA as ideologically inconsistent with the ideology espoused by Donald Trump and other right-wing populists . As a result of this campaign, some right-wing mainstream politicians and pundits disavowed Fuentes, characterizing his beliefs as extreme and out of touch with mainstream conservatism. &#91; 59 &#93; In December 2019, Fuentes confronted conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro outside a TPUSA event in West Palm Beach, Florida . Shapiro was walking with his wife and young children when Fuentes asked why he had delivered a speech at Stanford University criticizing him. &#91; 25 &#93; The filmed encounter drew criticism of Fuentes. &#91; 60 &#93; Groyper War 2 In August 2024, Fuentes began a ""digital war"" against Trump's presidential campaign , which he dubbed ""Groyper War 2"", referencing his followers' activities in 2019. &#91; 61 &#93; In response to Trump's poor polling , Fuentes began calling on his followers to ""bring the energy with memes, edits, replies, and trolls"" aimed at pressuring Trump's campaign to adopt further-right positions on race and immigration, as well as urging Trump to fire his campaign advisors Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles . &#91; 62 &#93; In addition to directing his followers to make their demands trend on X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social , Fuentes threatened to ""escalate pressure in the real world"", urging followers to withhold their votes and protest Trump rallies in battleground states. &#91; 61 &#93; Shortly after initiating this effort, Fuentes took credit for Trump's rehiring of Corey Lewandowski as a senior campaign advisor. An anonymous source cited by The Washington Post claimed that Fuentes was making it ""far more difficult for Trump"" to make changes to his campaign ""if it looks like he's responding to the groypers"". &#91; 61 &#93; A senior researcher for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue speculated that Fuentes's ""crude"" attempts at platform manipulation could be a blueprint for more sophisticated actors, such as hostile states , to engage in foreign election interference due to the lack of enforcement actions taken by Twitter and Truth Social in response to Fuentes's brief influence campaign. &#91; 63 &#93; &#91; 64 &#93; Social media In January 2020, Time reported that Fuentes was the most-viewed live streamer on the DLive platform. &#91; 65 &#93; &#91; 66 &#93; Fuentes has been deplatformed from various social media websites, payment processors, and other services. Following the deplatforming from major providers such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram , and DLive , Fuentes collaborated with Alex Jones to launch his own live-streaming platform, Cozy.tv, in October 2021. &#91; 16 &#93; &#91; 35 &#93; According to leaked text messages obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch , Millie Weaver , an employee of InfoWars , previously warned Jones against partnering with Fuentes, alleging that several of his associates (chiefly Matthew Colligan ) were informants for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that partnering with him would negatively impact the sales of Jones's line of dietary supplements . &#91; 67 &#93; On May 2, 2024, Elon Musk said that he would reinstate Fuentes' X (formerly Twitter) account ""provided he does not violate the law, and let him be crushed by the comments and Community Notes "". Musk stated, ""I cannot claim to be a defender of free speech, but then permanently ban someone who hasn't violated the law, no matter how much I disagree with what they say."" Musk addressed backlash by those who expressed concerns about platforming Fuentes' ideas by stating, ""It is better to have anti whatever out in the open to be rebutted than to grow simmering in the darkness."" &#91; 68 &#93; &#91; 69 &#93; &#91; 70 &#93; Upon X's announcement, the Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning Fuentes. Fuentes' account was reinstated on May 3, 2024. &#91; 71 &#93; Political views and activities This article is part of a series on Christian nationalism in the United States Principles Anti-abortion movement Anti-abortion violence Authoritarianism Christian fundamentalism Christian Identity Christian persecution complex Christian reconstructionism Conservatism National Social Ultra Dominionism Seven Mountain Mandate Familialism Great Replacement conspiracy theory Gun rights Heteronormativity Islamophobia Judeo-Christian ethics Natalism Nationalism Ethnic Religious Ultra White Nativism Patriarchy Supremacism Christian White Theonomy White backlash Xenophobia History Ruby Ridge standoff Waco siege Christian Patriot movement Tea Party movement American Redoubt January 6 United States Capitol attack ReAwaken America Tour Project 2025 Politicians Beckwith Boebert Click Deevers Flynn Gibbs Greene Hawley Hegseth Hoover Lewis O'Daniel Prichard Sexton Schriver Trump Utt Vought Activists Ainsworth Beale Barton Capell Capt Comparet Flynn Fuentes Haywood Kirk Moore Pelley Peters Sellner Sheets Smith Wallnau Wambsganss Wiles Witzke White-Cain Organizations America First Party Army of God Christian Liberty Party Christian Nationalist Crusade Constitution Party Georgia Republic Militia Hutaree Jericho March Liberty Lobby Moral Majority National States' Rights Party New Apostolic Reformation Project Blitz Silver Legion of America Society for American Civic Renewal Veterans on Patrol Related topics American civil religion Bible Belt The Case for Christian Nationalism Christianity in the United States God Bless America In God We Trust Ku Klux Klan Libertarianism in the United States American militia movement Christian Patriot movement Racism in the United States Arab Palestinian Hispanic Jewish Sovereign citizen movement Theocracy Trumpism Christian support Christianity&#32;portal Conservatism&#32;portal United States&#32;portal v t e Alt-right Fuentes has stated that his goal is to turn the Republican Party into ""a truly reactionary party"". &#91; 16 &#93; He hopes to have the alt-right displace conservatism and the GOP, criticizing mainstream conservative groups and claiming that ""Christian Republican voters get screwed over"" because ""the GOP is run by Jews , atheists , and homosexuals "". &#91; 9 &#93; &#91; 16 &#93; Tess Owen, a reporter for Vice , has written that Fuentes ""has positioned himself as the kingpin of the ultranationalist youth movement"". &#91; 5 &#93; Anti-immigration Fuentes strongly opposes immigration , which he believes is a demographic threat to the United States. &#91; 37 &#93; White supremacy Fuentes has spoken positively of ""a tidal wave of white identity "" following his attendance at the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally and sees America's ""white demographic core"" as central to the country's identity. &#91; 16 &#93; &#91; 72 &#93; &#91; 28 &#93; Despite promoting white supremacist beliefs, such as the white genocide conspiracy theory , Fuentes has claimed that he is not a white supremacist, calling the term an ""anti-white slur"". &#91; 9 &#93; Fuentes wants the United States to be a white, Christian country and has specified that it is not a "" Judeo-Christian "" country. &#91; 16 &#93; On Fuentes' America First podcast, Fuentes stated: ""Jews are running society, women need to shut the fuck up, Blacks need to be imprisoned for the most part, and we would live in paradise; it's that simple"". Continuing, Fuentes says, ""But the older I get, the more I realize it is really this simple. We need white men in charge of everything again"". &#91; 73 &#93; Anti-semitism Fuentes also holds antisemitic views &#91; 10 &#93; &#91; 74 &#93; and denies the Holocaust . In January 2019, Fuentes aired a monologue in which he implied he questions the death toll of six million Jews in the Holocaust . Fuentes later disputed that he had ever denied the Holocaust, calling his monologue a "" lampoon "". &#91; 25 &#93; NPR cites this as an example of Fuentes' use of irony to avoid consequences for his words, citing a 2020 video where Fuentes said, ""Irony is so important for giving a lot of cover and plausible deniability for our views,"" specifically regarding Holocaust denial. &#91; 39 &#93; Fuentes frequently praises Adolf Hitler . &#91; 75 &#93; During his speech at AFPAC 2022 , Fuentes bestowed ""giggling praise"" on Hitler. &#91; 54 &#93; Catholic integralism and Christian nationalism Fuentes is Catholic &#91; 25 &#93; and identifies with the traditionalist Catholic movement. &#91; 24 &#93; Fuentes is also an integralist and a Christian nationalist . He has said, ""You're either a Catholic or you're with the Jews,"" and he has voiced support for a Catholic government and Catholic media. Fuentes supports a Christian theocracy instead of what he calls a "" Jewish-occupied government "". &#91; 76 &#93; Fuentes has described himself as a reactionary who supports autocracy , Catholic monarchy , just war , the Crusades , and the Inquisition . Fuentes opposes democracy . &#91; 17 &#93; He described the religion of Islam as ""a barbaric ideology that [wants] to come over and kill us"". &#91; 77 &#93; Foreign policy Russia During the AFPAC speech in which he praised Hitler, Fuentes said that the media had been comparing Vladimir Putin to Hitler ""as if that wasn't a good thing"". &#91; 54 &#93; Fuentes also asked the audience, ""Can we get a round of applause for Russia?"" which was followed by roaring applause and chants of ""Putin! Putin!"" &#91; 51 &#93; On March 10, 2022, Fuentes praised "" czar Putin"" for the Russian invasion of Ukraine , &#91; 78 &#93; which he claimed was to ""liberate Ukraine from the Great Satan and from the evil empire in the world, which is the United States"". &#91; 52 &#93; China Fuentes would support a Chinese invasion of Taiwan , saying in 2022, ""I want China to take back Taiwan, I want Russia to take back Ukraine, if for no other reason than it’s time for America to be humiliated."" &#91; 78 &#93; Israel Fuentes is a vocal critic of Israel . &#91; 79 &#93; He stated that the United States should withdraw support for Israel because, ""We're European, they're ethnically Jewish"". &#91; 80 &#93; He claimed that the Hamas -led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, was ""staged"" to ""justify Israel’s unfolding war to destroy Iran and its proxies"". &#91; 81 &#93; Taliban Fuentes has praised the conservative religious aspect of Islamist Taliban governance. &#91; 82 &#93; &#91; 83 &#93; &#91; 84 &#93; &#91; 85 &#93; &#91; 86 &#93; He has been described as having ""disdain"" for Muslims, but he states that his goal is ""Catholic Taliban rule"" in the United States. &#91; 87 &#93; After the Afghan government fell to the Taliban while American forces were withdrawing in August 2021 , Fuentes posted on the Telegram messaging service, ""The Taliban is a conservative, religious force, the US is godless and liberal. The defeat of the US government in Afghanistan is unequivocally a positive development."" &#91; 85 &#93; COVID-19 Fuentes has frequently spread conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding the FDA -approved COVID-19 vaccines . &#91; 88 &#93; In December 2020, Fuentes reportedly had an altercation on a flight over mask mandates . &#91; 9 &#93; In April 2021, Salon reported that ""Nicholas Fuentes and his 'groyper army' have joined forces with the coronavirus anti-vaccine community."" &#91; 88 &#93; That year, he embarked on an anti-vaccine speaking tour, where he promoted hoaxes about COVID-19 vaccines . &#91; 89 &#93; Homophobia He has spoken out against the "" LGBT agenda "", &#91; 90 &#93; and has described transgender people and same-sex marriage as ""deviancy"". &#91; 1 &#93; He said that ""Jews stood in the way"" of overturning Roe v. Wade, and that the Dobbs decision meant that ""banning gay marriage is back on the menu, banning sodomy is back on the menu, banning contraceptives is back on the menu, and basically we're having something like Taliban rule in America, in a good way."" &#91; 91 &#93; &#91; 86 &#93; Misogyny In a documentary for the BBC broadcast in 2022, Fuentes told the British journalist Louis Theroux that he believes it would be better if women did not have the right to vote . &#91; 92 &#93; In July 2023, appearing on the Fresh and Fit Podcast , Fuentes stated that women were ""baby machines"" because ""that's what their brains are about"". &#91; 93 &#93; He has stated that the optimal age for a wife is 16, which he states is ""right when the milk is good."" &#91; 87 &#93; Fuentes identifies as an incel (or ""involuntary celibate""), although some of his supporters have criticized him for being a ""voluntary celibate"" after he admitted that he kissed a girl while he was in high school . &#91; 94 &#93; &#91; 95 &#93; He has described himself as the ""straightest guy"" and attempted to defend himself as an incel by claiming that ""the only really straight heterosexual position is to be an asexual incel"", as ""having sex with women is gay&#160;... What's gayer than being like, 'I need cuddles. I need kisses&#160;... I need to spend time with a woman. ' "" &#91; 96 &#93; &#91; 97 &#93; &#91; 98 &#93; Abortion Following the Dobbs v. Jackson decision that overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Fuentes praised the Supreme Court of the United States for handing down that decision. &#91; 91 &#93; Nicholas J. Fuentes @NickJFuentes Your body, my choice. Forever. November 5, 2024 &#91; 99 &#93; In November 2024, after Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election , Fuentes mocked supporters of reproductive rights, tweeting, ""Your body, my choice. Forever."" (a malicious spin on the freedom of choice slogan "" My body, my choice "") &#91; 100 &#93; The phrase became popular on TikTok , &#91; 101 &#93; where female users reported that accounts were commenting ""your body, my choice"" en masse on their posts. On November 8, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue published a report detailing the exponential increase of the phrase's usage on X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Facebook , and Reddit on the day after the 2024 elections. They also noted instances of its usage offline, specifically on high school and college campuses. &#91; 102 &#93; Donald Trump Dinner at Mar-a-Lago See also: Kanye West presidential campaigns §&#160;Trump–West–Fuentes meeting , and Racial views of Donald Trump §&#160;Meeting with Nick Fuentes and Kanye West On November 22, 2022, Donald Trump hosted Fuentes and Kanye West for a dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida . The meeting was at West's request. West said that Trump was ""really impressed with Nick Fuentes"". &#91; 103 &#93; Trump released a statement saying that after contacting him earlier in the week to arrange the visit, West ""unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about"", with whom Trump dined, and that ""the dinner was quick and uneventful"". &#91; 104 &#93; Trump further elaborated several days later that he met with West to ""help a seriously troubled man, who just happens to be black... who has been decimated in his business and virtually everything else."" &#91; 103 &#93; Trump also acknowledged advising West to drop out of the race. &#91; 103 &#93; Members of the meeting gave contradictory accounts &#91; 105 &#93; of what occurred. &#91; 106 &#93; According to Axios : &#91; 107 &#93; ...a source stated that Trump ""seemed very taken"" by Fuentes and ""impressed that the 24-year-old was able to rattle off statistics and recall speeches dating back to his 2016 campaign ."" Paraphrasing the conversation, the source said Fuentes told the president he preferred him to be ""authentic"", and that Trump seemed scripted and unlike himself during his recent 2024 campaign announcement speech. Trump responded, ""You like it better when I just speak off the cuff,"" the source said. Fuentes replied that he did, calling Trump an ""amazing"" president when he was unrestrained. ""There was a lot of fawning back and forth,"" the source added. &#91; 107 &#93; West also stated that after asking Trump to be his vice-presidential candidate, Trump ""started basically screaming at me at the table telling me I was going to lose—I mean has that ever worked for anyone in history. I'm like hold on, hold on, hold on, Trump, you're talking to Ye."" &#91; 108 &#93; The meeting received significant attention and comment from domestic and international political figures. &#91; 109 &#93; &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 110 &#93; &#91; 111 &#93; The nature of the event—in which a former president hosted guests with open antisemitic beliefs—was considered ""unprecedented"" &#91; 112 &#93; in the modern era and garnered intense bipartisan criticism of Trump, with Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress making a rare rebuke of Trump. &#91; 113 &#93; The scandal raised questions over Trump's tenability as a candidate in the 2024 election. &#91; 114 &#93; &#91; 115 &#93; &#91; 116 &#93; &#91; 117 &#93; Among American Jews , the ensuing discussion was described by a New York Times writer as ""what may be the most discomfiting moment in U.S. history in a half-century or more"". &#91; 118 &#93; Commentators and politicians argued Trump's failure to condemn antisemitism and racism from the guests was an implicit acceptance of their beliefs. &#91; 119 &#93; Trump defended the dinner in a Truth Social post, writing about West: ""we got along great, he expressed no anti-Semitism, &amp; I appreciated all of the nice things he said about me on 'Tucker Carlson'"" and ""why wouldn't I agree to meet?"", and that he ""never met and knew nothing about"" Fuentes. &#91; 120 &#93; According to The Washington Post , Trump initially believed that the events of the evening would ""blow over"". But by December 1, the subsequent actions of West and Fuentes after the dinner had ""paint[ed] a different picture"" of the situation. &#91; 121 &#93; Mike Pence , the former U.S. vice president who served during Trump's first presidency , stated: ""I think he should apologize for it, and he should denounce those individuals and their hateful rhetoric without qualification."" &#91; 122 &#93; Israeli prime minister -designate Benjamin Netanyahu labeled the meeting a ""mistake"". &#91; 111 &#93; In a follow-up interview, Netanyahu stated: ""...on Kanye West and that other unacceptable guest [Nick Fuentes], I think it's not merely unacceptable, it's just wrong. And I hope he sees his way to staying out of it and condemning it."" &#91; 123 &#93; Later views Fuentes was increasingly critical of Trump in 2024. &#91; 19 &#93; On August 9, 2024, he posted on X that he had ""declared a new Groyper War against the 2024 Trump campaign "", as ""his campaign has been hijacked by the same consultants, lobbyists, &amp; donors that he defeated in 2016, and they're blowing it"", and was ""headed for a catastrophic loss"". &#91; 124 &#93; He said he would not vote for Trump and his running mate, JD Vance . He questioned whether Vance would ""support white identity "", since Vance's wife is of Indian heritage. &#91; 125 &#93; &#91; 126 &#93; Fuentes began calling for his followers to ""bring the energy with memes, edits, replies, and trolls"" aimed at pressuring the Trump campaign to adopt further-right positions on race and immigration, as well as urging Donald Trump to fire his campaign advisors, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles . &#91; 127 &#93; In addition to directing his followers to make their demands trend on Twitter and Truth Social , Fuentes threatened to ""escalate pressure in the real world"", urging followers to withhold their votes and protest Trump rallies in battleground states . &#91; 35 &#93; In November, Fuentes criticized Trump supporters for dressing in garbage bags after a rally where Donald Trump climbed into a garbage truck in response to President Joe Biden 's remarks about his followers. He described this as a moment of realization that "" Trumpism was a cult"", illustrating the ""slavish devotion"" of its supporters, who would ""just eat up anything"". He stated, ""That was the moment when I realized it has gone too far, it is Frankenstein's monster , we've created a golem"", and characterized Trumpism as ""a giant cult-like scam"". &#91; 128 &#93; He doubled down on his negative opinion on Trump in 2025, insulting Trump shortly after both his refusal to release the Epstein files and his implied disdain for supporters of his that called for the release of said files, before stating that the ""liberals were right"", and that ""when we look back on the history of populism in America, we are going to look back on the MAGA movement as the biggest scam in history"". &#91; 129 &#93; Legal issues and controversies In 2022, Fuentes was caught on video hurling a drink at customers during an altercation at a Hollywood, California, In-N-Out Burger , after diners confronted him and threw ketchup cups in his direction. &#91; 130 &#93; Battery arrest On November 10, Marla Rose, an activist from the city, approached his home and attempted to ring his doorbell. Allegedly, Fuentes pepper-sprayed Rose before pushing her down his front steps and taking her phone, which she was using to film the interaction. &#91; 131 &#93; Following this incident, Fuentes was arrested on November 27 and charged with battery; he later appeared in court on December 19. &#91; 132 &#93; &#91; 133 &#93; Deplatforming In January 2020, Fuentes' YouTube channel was demonetized , and one of his videos was removed by YouTube as a violation of their hate speech policies. Fuentes had previously been banned from Twitch and from Reddit . &#91; 134 &#93; &#91; 135 &#93; On February 14, 2020, his YouTube channel was terminated for violating policies on hate speech. &#91; 136 &#93; DLive has been criticized for allowing Fuentes to use their platform. &#91; 65 &#93; &#91; 66 &#93; Following the January 6 United States Capitol attack, his DLive channel was subsequently suspended permanently for ""inciting violent and illegal activities"". &#91; 137 &#93; &#91; 138 &#93; According to ABC News in March 2021, Fuentes had been suspended from ""almost all"" social media platforms. &#91; 139 &#93; Fuentes claimed that his bank account had been frozen, that he had been placed on a federal no-fly list , &#91; 140 &#93; and that he had been banned from Airbnb , Facebook , and Instagram . Fuentes described these actions as ""overt political persecution"". &#91; 9 &#93; Twitter was among the last mainstream social media sites to ban Fuentes, indefinitely suspending his verified account in July 2021. &#91; 141 &#93; &#91; 142 &#93; &#91; 143 &#93; He has also been banned from financial and e-commerce services, including PayPal , Venmo , Patreon , Shopify , Stripe , Streamlabs , and Coinbase . &#91; 35 &#93; On January 25, 2023, his verified Twitter account was briefly reinstated. According to Hannah Gais, a senior researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center, he immediately praised Adolf Hitler and the Unabomber and declared, "" Jews run the news "". Twitter banned him again the next day. &#91; 144 &#93; In December 2021, the social media platform Gettr permanently suspended Fuentes. The site received backlash from Fuentes' fanbase as well as from the American politician Wendy Rogers , who wrote, ""What is the point of a free-speech alternative to Twitter &#160; ... that doesn't even honor free speech?"" &#91; 145 &#93; Gettr subsequently banned all use of the word ""groyper"" on the platform. &#91; 146 &#93; Relation to the January 6 Capitol attack Deposition of Nicholas J. Fuentes, (Feb. 16, 2022) for the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack . Fuentes was among the far-right individuals and groups who participated in the rallies that led up to the January 6 United States Capitol attack . &#91; 147 &#93; &#91; 148 &#93; At a pro-Trump protest in Washington, D.C., in December 2020, Fuentes led a crowd to chant ""Destroy the GOP "" and encouraged them to sit out the United States Senate special runoff election in Georgia . &#91; 149 &#93; In February 2021, a video of his speech was played during the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump by the House delegate Stacey Plaskett . &#91; 150 &#93; Fuentes was among a group of far-right activists and groups who received large donations in bitcoin from a French donor on December 8, 2020. Fuentes received 13.5 bitcoin (approximately $681,750 at the time), which was by far the largest share. The donor also posted an apparent suicide note, according to blockchain analysis group Chainalysis . The donor's status has not yet been confirmed. &#91; 151 &#93; &#91; 152 &#93; &#91; 153 &#93; &#91; 154 &#93; The FBI began an investigation as to whether any of this money went toward the financing of illegal acts, such as the storming of the U.S. Capitol. &#91; 155 &#93; On December 12, 2020, at a rally the day after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Texas v. Pennsylvania , Fuentes spoke to a crowd of supporters at Freedom Plaza , stating, ""It is us and our ancestors that created everything good that you see in this country. All these people that have taken over our country—we do not need them. ... It is the American people, and our leader, Donald Trump, against everybody else in this country and this world... Our Founding Fathers would get in the streets, and they would take this country back by force if necessary. And that is what we must be prepared to do."" &#91; 156 &#93; On January 4, 2021, two days before the storming of the U.S. Capitol, Fuentes discussed killing state legislators who were unwilling to overturn the results of the 2020 election, saying, ""What can you and I do to a state legislator—besides kill them? We should not do that. I'm not advising that, but I mean, what else can you do, right?"" &#91; 148 &#93; &#91; 147 &#93; &#91; 138 &#93; &#91; 157 &#93; According to several media outlets, Fuentes was part of the mob that attacked the Capitol. &#91; 158 &#93; &#91; 159 &#93; The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that Fuentes was ""visible in both livestreams and images amidst a mob of pro-Trump insurrectionists...wearing what appears to be a VIP badge."" &#91; 160 &#93; Although he did not enter the building, he allegedly shouted encouragement for the rioters to ""Keep moving towards the Capitol – it appears we are taking the Capitol back! … Break down the barriers and disregard the police. The Capitol belongs to us!"" &#91; 161 &#93; &#91; 160 &#93; &#91; 9 &#93; Fuentes himself admitted being present during the attack but denied criminal conduct, describing rumors that an unidentified figure seen inside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's office was him as "" fake news "". &#91; 162 &#93; On January 19, 2022, the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack issued a subpoena to Fuentes. &#91; 163 &#93; Ali Alexander underage sexual misconduct allegations Main article: Ali Alexander §&#160;Sexual harassment allegations In 2023, Fuentes and associates were ""embroiled in a scandal"" about Fuentes's friend, Ali Alexander . Intelligencer reported on two accusers, who said Alexander ""came on to them when they were teenage boys, asking for nudes from a 17-year-old and pressuring a 15-year-old to have sex with him."" &#91; 164 &#93; Fuentes was ""facing criticism for allegedly trying to cover for him."" &#91; 164 &#93; U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene requested an FBI investigation, stating, ""This is disgusting textbook predation of underage boys. And Nick Fuentes was in on it."" &#91; 165 &#93; &#91; 166 &#93; One accuser said he believed Fuentes was ""100 percent aware"" of the alleged situation, yet did not intervene at the time. &#91; 164 &#93; The other accuser said ""Nick personally asked me to apologize to Ali for supposedly faking the messages."" &#91; 164 &#93; Fuentes denied the allegations. &#91; 164 &#93; Milo Yiannopoulos , a ""one-time Alexander ally"", &#91; 167 &#93; published interviews and alleged evidence with the two accusers. &#91; 164 &#93; &#91; 167 &#93; He also released a text that he alleged he sent to Fuentes in January 2022, which read, ""Alexander wants to come to your events to have sex with underage boys. Snap out of it."" &#91; 164 &#93; &#91; 168 &#93; Alexander later apologized. &#91; 167 &#93; &#91; 169 &#93; &#91; 164 &#93; He also said he was targeted by ""fake accusers or literal honey pots eager to frame me"", &#91; 167 &#93; and that some of the claims were ""defamatory and false"". &#91; 169 &#93; He said ""nothing unlawful has occurred."" &#91; 167 &#93; Alexander issued an apology on Friday night [April 14th, 2023] beginning with a strange intro: ""This is too gay."" He acknowledged he had been struggling with ""SSA,"" a conservative Christian acronym for "" same-sex attraction ."" He did not deny the allegations but apologized ""for any inappropriate messages sent over the years,"" adding, ""When I've flirted or others have flirted with me, I've flexed my credentials or dropped corny pick up lines. Other times, I've been careless and should've qualified those coming up to me's &#32;&#91; sic &#93; identities during flirtatious banter at the start."" —&#8202; Intelligencer &#91; 164 &#93; The Daily Dot said there was an ongoing police investigation into the allegations. &#91; 170 &#93; Doxxing and alleged murder attempt In November 2024, the address of Fuentes' Berwyn, Illinois , home was doxed on Twitter in response to Fuentes mocking abortion advocates in his tweet ""Your body, my choice"". &#91; 171 &#93; A photo of the shooter, 24-year-old John Lyons, outside Fuentes' home On December 18, 2024, at 11:30 P.M. ( CST ), a man armed with a pistol and a crossbow showed up at Fuentes' home in Berwyn, Illinois . &#91; 172 &#93; The man, identified as 24-year-old John Lyons of Westchester , was suspected of killing a mother and her two adult children &#91; 173 &#93; &#91; 174 &#93; in Mahomet earlier in the day. After police arrived, Lyons fled, forcing his way into Fuentes' neighbor's residence, where he killed two dogs. Lyons then fled into a backyard, where he refused police commands and exchanged gunfire with them before being fatally shot. &#91; 175 &#93; &#91; 176 &#93; &#91; 177 &#93; Fuentes made a statement on his X account, writing, ""Last night an armed killer made an attempt on my life at my home, which was recently doxed on this platform"". He also wrote, ""The gunman carried a pistol, crossbow, and incendiary devices. I believe he intended to kill me. He is now dead. I am okay!"" &#91; 172 &#93; Media coverage In 2022, BBC Two produced the documentary Louis Theroux : Forbidden America: Extreme and Online. Fuentes is prominently featured as part of an exploration of the American far-right online subculture. &#91; 178 &#93; References ^ a b c d Yilek, Caitlin (November 29, 2022).

January 25, 2023 Two days before Thanksgiving, former President Donald Trump hosted the disgraced and antisemitic rapper Kanye West and his friends, including another notorious antisemite - far-right leader and white supremacist Nick Fuentes - for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. In October, West, now also known as Ye, posted antisemitic tropes on his social media accounts , shared antisemitic conspiracy theories with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and later, to his social media audience of more than 31 million, threatened violence against Jews. On January 24, Twitter under CEO Elon Musk, reinstated Fuentes account despite his antisemitic and white supremacist views. The decision is part of a string of moves by Musk's social media company to reinstate controversial figures barred by the platform. One of Fuente's first posts was a short video promoting Ye's 2024 presidential campaign, including a nod to an antisemitic tweet from the rapper. However, within a day of his reinstatement, it appears that Fuentes had been banned again. Whether from Ye, Fuentes, or other sources - antisemitism is dangerous and must be confronted. In this article, we explore what you need to know about Nicholas “Nick” J. Fuentes, his America First movement, “the Groypers,” Milo Yiannopoulos, and more . &nbsp; Who is Nick Fuentes? Nick Fuentes, 24, is a white supremacist, Holocaust denier who hates Jews. Fuentes gained notoriety amongst the fringes of society as a freshman at Boston University, when he attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia , where hundreds of torch-bearing far-right demonstrators chanted “Jews will not replace us.” &nbsp; Fuentes prefers to be called a “Christian conservative” rather than a “white supremacist.” Raised Roman Catholic, he hailed the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade as the advent of a “ Catholic Taliban rule – in a good way” and encourages other Christian nationalists to do the same. America will cease to exist as a Christian nation, he says, “if it loses its white demographic core and if it loses its faith in Jesus Christ.” In a debate on Alex Jones’ InfoWars in May 2021, he said that Jews have no place in Western civilization because they are not Christian. AJC Email Signup Receive updates from AJC Email address What is America First? America First carries a historical and antisemitic context dating to the 1940s. Then, the America First committee was an isolationist group of some 800,000 members whose chief spokesman, the iconic pilot Charles Lindbergh, blamed American Jews for dragging the U.S. into World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuentes’ movement includes a podcast, an annual conference, and a social media following. Shortly after the Unite the Right rally in 2017, Fuentes left college to host “America First with Nicholas J. Fuentes,” a live-streamed show he launched six months earlier. On that show, he called for “killing the globalists” who run the media. Used in such a context, “globalist” promotes the antisemitic conspiracy that Jews are working toward a new worldwide order that will enhance their control over the world’s banks, governments, and media. The conspiracy is at the core of Nazi ideology. Until his recent reinstatement by Twitter, Fuentes had been banned by almost every social media platform for violating their policies against hate speech. For example, he has questioned the validity of the Holocaust, drawing a crass analogy between the ovens of the concentration camps and six million batches of cookies . But that near universal ban is a badge of honor for the rising alt-right star who can be found these days on Trump’s new social platform Truth Social, as well as Telegram, an instant messaging site, and Gab, a social network – all known for their far-right user bases. Fuentes also organized the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), an annual alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) for far-right extremists. At this year’s conference, Fuentes called young white men the “secret sauce” for a stronger America, and called for a round of applause for Russia and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin . What is a Groyper? Fuentes’ fans call themselves “Groypers,” the name of a green cartoon amphibian – maybe Pepe the Frog , possibly a toad – that has become a popular meme and calling card. In fact, new Twitter CEO Elon Musk tweeted out an example first thing Monday morning as news of Trump and West’s meal with Fuentes spread.&nbsp; Groypers oppose immigration, gay and transgender rights, women’s rights, and limits to hate speech. They blame mainstream conservatives for destroying white America by not doing enough to safeguard traditional values. Like Fuentes, they traffic conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial and accuse Jews of dual loyalty to Israel. AJC’s Translate Hate Glossary A note on Milo Yiannopoulos According to Ye, Fuentes is advising the rapper’s newly announced 2024 presidential campaign alongside another antisemite: Milo Yiannopoulos. Yiannopoulos is a former Breitbart writer, editor, and provocateur who just wrapped up an internship for Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). Taylor has distorted the Holocaust, promoted QAnon conspiracies, and accused Jews of using space lasers to start wildfires. While Fuentes has denied the Holocaust and West threatened to go “Death-Con 3” on the Jews, Yiannopoulous helped promote a new antisemitic term during the pandemic – “Holocough” – a call to spread COVID-19 to Jews.&nbsp; During a podcast recording on Monday , the trio explained that Alex Jones’ producer introduced Ye and Yiannopoulos in October after the rapper’s antisemitic tirade on Twitter. Yiannopoulos then recommended that Fuentes join Ye’s campaign team.&nbsp; During that same podcast, host Tim Pool pushed back when Fuentes backed up Ye’s attack on Jews for controlling the media, prompting all three guests to walk out of the studio and abandon the interview.&nbsp; &nbsp; 10 Tough Questions on Antisemitism Explained Share This Share This Back to Top More from More Antisemitism News AJC Joined by 75+ Global Jewish Organizations in Expressing Support for Katharina von Schnurbein Read the Press Release Who Is Elias Rodriguez?

Suspect Tyler Robinson allegedly inscribed messages on bullet casings that reference video games and internet culture&#8212;but they hardly point toward a coherent ideology. By Joshua Rivera September 12, 2025 LONDON, UNITED KONGDOM - SEPTEMBER 12: A memorial service is held in front of the Prime Minister&#39;s Office in Downing Street for politician and activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed in a shooting, in London, United Kingdom, on September 12, 2025. Kirk, 31, was fatally shot Wednesday while addressing a group of students at Utah Valley University in the city of Orem, some 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. The apparent targeted attack occurred despite security, including six university police officers and Kirk&#39;s private team. (Photo by Rasid Necati Aslim /Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu/Getty Images Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story On Friday morning, Tyler Robinson —the suspected killer of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk —was taken into custody after a two-day manhunt. (According to an affidavit obtained by People , he’s likely to face charges, including aggravated murder.) At a public briefing , FBI director Kash Patel and Utah governor Spencer Cox revealed that the shooter’s bullet casings were allegedly inscribed with bizarre messages: One read “Notices bulges OwO what’s this?” Unfired cartridges in the magazine allegedly read “Hey fascist! Catch!,”followed by five arrow symbols: one up, one right, and three down. Two others read “Oh Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao” and “If you read this, you are gay lmao.” Photographs of the ammunition have not yet been made public, and it’s possible that there are minor discrepancies in punctuation—but none that would make these phrases appear any less nonsensical. That is, unless you have a passing familiarity with gamer and internet-forum culture. The “OwO” casing, for instance, appears to be referencing a popular meme making fun of furry culture , a niche lifestyle in which people create alter egos styled after anthropomorphic animals. The combination of arrows found on another matches the combination of buttons players use to call in a bomb strike in the video game Helldivers 2, a Starship Troopers –style parody of a fascist interstellar empire. The Italian words are the lyrics to “Bella Ciao,” an antifascist Italian folk song that was prominently featured in the Netflix series Money Heist . And that last phrase appears to be little more than a joke meant to antagonize or troll the reader. As of yet, little is known about Robinson’s alleged motivations or ideology. But the few details surrounding the 22-year old point toward a troubling trend: young shooter suspects who communicate primarily via obtuse memes and digitally inflected irony. All sorts of young adults are familiar with the culture of video games, Twitch streamers, and YouTube, speaking a language completely foreign to those who do not spend as much time online. Is that language inherently sinister? No more than, say “ Skibidi Toilet ,” a series of crude animated shorts about toilets from which talking heads emerge. ( There’s a movie in the works .) None of the phrases Robinson allegedly wrote are known code words for anything nefarious; they signal little beyond a connection to a contextless internet, where memes take on a life of their own and are used by the benign and malignant alike. Some memes, however, aren’t so neutral. The young men who admired, and still admire, Charlie Kirk tend to be extremely online —which doesn’t necessarily mean that they all share exactly the same ideology. Internecine conflict between conservative factions is common, both on social media and at events for young conservatives. The most notable of these are the “Groyper Wars” of 2019 . “Groypers” are fans of white nationalist agitator Nick Fuentes who like to hide their racism behind ironic jokes; when Kirk began making an effort to mainstream his ultra-right-wing Turning Point USA movement, Fuentes instructed them to publicly troll Kirk . A Facebook photo in which Robinson appears to reference a Groyper meme has led to early speculation that Kirk’s killing may have been an outgrowth of these intra-far-right skirmishes. But another feature of the modern far-right is an embrace of the post-truth huckster. In these circles, it’s always possible that someone is playing a character—or will claim to be doing so, muddying the waters so no one can accuse them of having a sincere belief beyond the desire to rile up their targets. For people like this, the whole world is a forum board, where lewd public comments and real-world violence are becoming increasingly interchangeable. (Consider the messages left behind by the deceased shooter of Annunciation Catholic School, which were full of references to both other shooters and innocuous memes.) In every respect, the circumstances surrounding Kirk’s murder are alarming for those with the understandable impulse to make some kind of sense out of terrifying events. It is true that real-life violence is the end result of our cultural coarsening . It is also important to remember that Robinson’s generation is entering public life with frames of reference that are totally foreign to its elders, regardless of individual ideology. We cannot properly comprehend the harm of bad actors or the concerns of the innocent until we have taken the time to learn their language—and sometimes, even then we won’t understand.

Groypers are a loosely defined group of Fuentes's followers and fans. &#91; 4 &#93; &#91; 5 &#93; After him, there is no clear second in the Groyper hierarchy. Groypers are named after a cartoon amphibian named ""Groyper"", a variant of the Internet meme Pepe the Frog . Members of the group have attempted to introduce alt-right politics into mainstream conservatism in the United States and participated in the January 6 United States Capitol attack and the protests leading up to it. They have targeted other conservative groups and individuals whose agendas they view as too moderate and insufficiently racist and nationalist . &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 7 &#93; &#91; 8 &#93; The Groyper movement has been described as white nationalist, homophobic , nativist , fascist , sexist , antisemitic , and an attempt to rebrand the declining alt-right movement. &#91; 5 &#93; &#91; 9 &#93; &#91; 10 &#93; &#91; 11 &#93; The Groyper War began in fall 2019 when Fuentes and his followers, known as Groypers, launched a social media campaign targeting Turning Point USA 's ""Culture War"" college tour, led by Charlie Kirk . Motivated by the firing of a Fuentes ally and prior conflicts, Groypers disrupted college events by asking provocative questions on immigration, Israel, and LGBT rights to challenge mainstream conservative figures like Kirk, Donald Trump Jr. , and Ben Shapiro , whom they labeled ""Conservative Inc."" for deviating from their far-right views. The campaign gained traction after a November 2019 UCLA event with Trump Jr. was cut short due to Groyper heckling, exposing divisions among conservatives. Fuentes expanded the movement with the Groyper Leadership Summit in December 2019 and the formation of America First Students in January 2020. In August 2024, Fuentes initiated ""Groyper War 2,"" a digital war campaign pressuring Donald Trump 's presidential campaign to adopt further-right stances, using memes, trolling, and threats to withhold votes. In February 2021, the Groyper movement splintered between Fuentes and Patrick Casey over fears of infiltration by federal informants and doxing at the 2021 America First Political Action Conference , held by Fuentes. Jaden McNeil of America First Students joined in support of Fuentes's conference and accused Casey of disloyalty to Fuentes. &#91; 12 &#93; &#91; 13 &#93; In May 2022, McNeil distanced himself from Fuentes in an ""interpersonal clash of egos"" following conflict over his former position as treasurer of Fuentes's America First Foundation. &#91; 14 &#93; Background and ideology Origins and symbolism of Groyper Meme Fuentes's followers began to be known as Groypers beginning in 2019. They are also sometimes called ""Nickers"". &#91; 5 &#93; &#91; 15 &#93; Groypers are named after a cartoon amphibian named ""Groyper"", a variant of the Internet meme Pepe the Frog . Groyper is depicted as a rotund, green, frog-like creature, often sitting with its chin resting on interlocked fingers. &#91; 16 &#93; &#91; 17 &#93; There is some disagreement about the details: Groyper is variously said to be a depiction of Pepe, &#91; 18 &#93; a different character from Pepe but of the same species, or a toad . &#91; 16 &#93; The Groyper meme was used as early as 2015 and became popular in 2017. &#91; 19 &#93; In 2018, a group of computer scientists studying hateful speech on Twitter observed the Groyper image being used frequently in account avatars among accounts identified as ""hateful"" in their dataset. The researchers observed that the profiles tended to be anonymous and collectively tweeted primarily about politics, race, and religion. They also found that the users were not ""lone wolves"" and could be identified as a community with a high network centrality. &#91; 20 &#93; The same year, Right Wing Watch reported that Massachusetts congressional hopeful Shiva Ayyadurai had created a campaign pin featuring a variation of the Groyper image, which RWW described as an attempt to appeal to far-right activists on 4chan , Gab , and Twitter who had adopted the meme. &#91; 21 &#93; Social media engagement Groypers are very active online, particularly on Twitter, and have engaged in targeted harassment. &#91; 15 &#93; Financial Times reported that many Groypers use ""deceptively anodyne"" Twitter biographies, describing themselves in terms that downplay their extremism, like ""Christian conservative"". &#91; 22 &#93; In April 2020, The Daily Dot reported that Fuentes and other Groypers had begun to move to TikTok , where they streamed live and used the ""duet"" feature to respond to Trump supporters. Groypers particularly targeted one left-wing teenage girl for harassment, first on TikTok and then on other platforms. &#91; 22 &#93; &#91; 23 &#93; Fuentes and some other Groyper accounts were banned from TikTok shortly after the Daily Dot article was published. &#91; 24 &#93; Departure from the Republican Party Groypers present themselves as defenders of Christian conservatism , "" traditional values "", and American nationalism . Their ideology diverges sharply from mainstream American conservatives, including the Republican Party . Rather than conserving inherited institutions or practicing prudence and incremental reform, Groypers advance a racialized politics that appeal to xenophobia and resentment . &#91; 25 &#93; They criticize mainstream conservative organizations for being insufficiently nationalist and pro-white, and employ tactics of entryism and radicalization such as gradually introducing their targets to increasingly extreme ideas. &#91; 26 &#93; Fuentes has said, ""We are the right-wing flank of the Republican Party"". He has summarized his political ambitions by saying, ""We have got to be on the right, dragging [Republicans] kicking and screaming into the future... Into a truly reactionary party"". &#91; 27 &#93; In 2022, Fuentes advocated for a ""white uprising"" to bring Donald Trump back to power and ""never leave"" and for the U.S. to ""stop having elections"" and abolish Congress . &#91; 28 &#93; &#91; 29 &#93; However, less than a year after Trump was reelected, Fuentes said "" Trump 2.0 has been a disappointment in literally every way but nobody wants to admit it."" &#91; 30 &#93; Among other topics, he criticized the president's support of Israel, failure to release the Epstein Files , and offer of student visas to Chinese nationals. &#91; 30 &#93; White nationalism, anti-semitism, and social stances Groypers are widely recognized as a white nationalist, antisemitic, and homophobic movement. &#91; 31 &#93; &#91; 3 &#93; &#91; 32 &#93; Fuentes has said he has been ""oppressed"" by ""the Jews "" and blamed the Jewish community for antisemitism, claiming that matters ""tend to go from zero to sixty"" and that ""the reason is them"". He has said that matters would get ""a lot uglier"" for their community if they do not begin to support ""people like us"". &#91; 33 &#93; &#91; 34 &#93; According to the Anti-Defamation League , Groypers blame the mainstream conservative movement as well as the political left for what they view as ""destroying white America"". They oppose immigration and globalism . Groypers support ""traditional"" values and Christianity and oppose feminism and LGBTQ rights . &#91; 3 &#93; Groypers' questions often focus on United States–Israel relations , immigration policy , affirmative action , and LGBTQ conservatives . &#91; 7 &#93; &#91; 35 &#93; &#91; 9 &#93; They regularly use antisemitic dog-whistles , including questions about the USS Liberty incident and references to the ""dancing Israelis"" conspiracy theory alleging Israeli involvement in the September 11 attacks . &#91; 4 &#93; &#91; 3 &#93; Nick Fuentes in 2022 Groyper War (2019) Origins In September 2019, Ashley St. Clair , a ""brand ambassador"" for the conservative student group Turning Point USA , was photographed at an event featuring several allegedly white nationalist and alt-right figures, including Fuentes, Jacob Wohl , and Anthime Gionet, better known as "" Baked Alaska "". After Right Wing Watch brought the photographs to its attention, Turning Point USA issued a statement that said it had severed ties with St. Clair and condemned white nationalism as ""abhorrent and un-American"". &#91; 36 &#93; &#91; 37 &#93; At the 2019 Politicon convention, Fuentes tried to attend several Turning Point events featuring its founder Charlie Kirk , including a line to take photos with Kirk and Kirk's debate with Kyle Kulinski of The Young Turks . Security repeatedly barred him from being allowed near Kirk, and Fuentes accused Kirk of suppressing him to avoid a confrontation, as Fuentes had grown critical of Kirk's positions, which he believes are too weak. &#91; 38 &#93; In the fall of 2019, Charlie Kirk launched a college speaking tour with Turning Point USA titled ""Culture War"", featuring himself and guests such as Rand Paul , Donald Trump Jr. , Kimberly Guilfoyle , Lara Trump , and Dan Crenshaw . &#91; 3 &#93; In retaliation for the firing of St. Clair and the Politicon incident, Fuentes began organizing a social media campaign asking his followers to go to Kirk's events and ask provocative and controversial leading questions about his stances on immigration, Israel , and LGBT rights to expose Kirk as a ""fake conservative"". At a Culture War event hosted by Ohio State University on October 29, 11 out of 14 questions were asked by Groypers. &#91; 15 &#93; Their questions included ""Can you prove that our white European ideals will be maintained if the country is no longer made up of white European descendants?"" They asked Kirk's co-host Rob Smith, a gay, black Iraq War veteran, ""How does anal sex help us win the culture war ?"" &#91; 39 &#93; Fuentes's social media campaign against Kirk became known as the ""Groyper Wars"". &#91; 9 &#93; &#91; 40 &#93; Kirk, Smith, and others at Turning Point USA, including Benny Johnson , began calling the questioners white supremacists and antisemites. &#91; 38 &#93; &#91; 41 &#93; Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin wrote an article for American Greatness attacking Kirk's immigration policies, particularly his stance that immigrants who graduate from U.S. universities should receive green cards . &#91; 42 &#93; After defending Fuentes and his followers, Malkin was fired as a speaker for Young America's Foundation , a rival organization to Turning Point whose events Groypers had also targeted. &#91; 43 &#93; &#91; 44 &#93; Malkin later called herself a mother figure to and leader of the Groypers. &#91; 45 &#93; &#91; 46 &#93; &#91; 47 &#93; UCLA incident Another Turning Point USA event the Groypers targeted was a promotional event for Donald Trump Jr.'s book Triggered , featuring Trump, Kirk, and Guilfoyle at the University of California, Los Angeles in November 2019. Anticipating further questions from Fuentes's followers, it was announced that the event's Q&amp;A portion would be canceled, which led to heckling and boos from the mostly pro-Trump audience. &#91; 48 &#93; The disruptions forced the event, originally scheduled to last two hours, to end after 30 minutes. &#91; 49 &#93; &#91; 50 &#93; &#91; 4 &#93; &#91; 51 &#93; The Groyper Wars earned widespread media attention after the UCLA incident with Donald Trump Jr. Chadwick Moore of Spectator USA commented that the ordeal revealed deep divisions within the American right among young voters, particularly Generation Z . Moore claimed this divide is due to the Groypers viewing Charlie Kirk and others in the mainstream conservative movement as ""snatching the baton and appointing themselves the guardians of 2016's spoils"", despite holding beliefs that Fuentes and his followers believe conflict with Trump's "" Make America Great Again "" agenda. &#91; 52 &#93; Another Spectator author, Ben Sixsmith, claimed that Turning Point's unwillingness to respond to controversial questions and use of insults to dismiss its critics revealed the organization's hypocrisy after having ""promoted themselves as the debate guys"". &#91; 53 &#93; Other targets including Ben Shapiro Groypers' targets for heckling quickly expanded beyond Kirk and Turning Point USA &#91; 40 &#93; &#91; 43 &#93; to other mainstream conservative groups and individuals, which they sometimes collectively call ""Conservative Inc."", including Young America's Foundation and its student outreach branch Young Americans for Freedom , which included such speakers as Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire and Jonah Goldberg of The Dispatch . &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 43 &#93; In December 2019, outside a venue where a Turning Point USA event was being held, Fuentes crossed paths with Ben Shapiro, who was on his way to the event with his wife and children. Fuentes confronted Shapiro over his past public speaking comments. Shapiro refused to acknowledge him. &#91; 54 &#93; Fuentes faced widespread condemnation from politicians and various pundits—including Nikki Haley , Meghan McCain , Sebastian Gorka , Megyn Kelly , and Michael Avenatti —for confronting Shapiro while he was with his family. &#91; 55 &#93; Addressing the increase in attention to the far-right due to the aggressive questioning of Kirk, Ben Shapiro gave a speech at Stanford University in which he attacked Fuentes (without naming him) and his followers as essentially a rebranded version of the alt-right. &#91; 56 &#93; &#91; 57 &#93; &#91; 58 &#93; Groyper Leadership Conference In December 2019, Fuentes held the Groyper Leadership Summit in Florida . A small group attended in person, and others joined via livestream. The event was held at the same time and in the same city as Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit (SAS); Groypers argued with SAS attendees outside their venue, and Fuentes, Patrick Casey, and some Groypers were removed from the SAS venue after attempting to enter. At the Groyper Leadership Summit, Fuentes, Casey, and former InfoWars contributor Jake Lloyd spoke about the Groypers' strategy and ideology. &#91; 59 &#93; In January 2020, Groyper and former leader of Kansas State University 's Turning Point USA chapter Jaden McNeil formed the Kansas State University organization America First Students. The group, which shares a name with Fuentes' America First podcast, was conceived at the Groyper Leadership Summit, and Groyper leaders have helped promote it. The America First Students organization, which says it formed ""in defense of Christian values, strong families, closed borders, and the American worker"", is considered to promote the Groyper movement. &#91; 60 &#93; &#91; 61 &#93; In February 2020, Fuentes spoke at several events held as rival events to the Conservative Political Action Conference . One of these, hosted by the online publication National File , featured Fuentes, Alex Jones of InfoWars , and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes . &#91; 62 &#93; &#91; 63 &#93; Fuentes hosted the first annual America First Political Action Conference , which included such speakers as Patrick Casey, former Daily Caller author Scott Greer, and Malkin. &#91; 64 &#93; January 6 United States Capitol attack Groypers were present at the January 6 United States Capitol attack and prominent among those who participated in the early waves of attack on the Capitol. &#91; 65 &#93; Exact numbers are not known, but several were arrested. In February 2021, the Anti-Defamation League reported that it had identified ten Groypers or related white supremacists involved in the riots. &#91; 66 &#93; Fuentes and Casey were on the Capitol steps and celebrated the temporary disruption of Congress, but have not been charged. &#91; 67 &#93; &#91; 68 &#93; Both were subpoenaed by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack in January 2022 for their role in planning the attack. &#91; 68 &#93; Key figures and legal outcomes Riley June Williams of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania , was accused of invading Nancy Pelosi 's office and stealing her laptop and gavel and of generally accelerating the attack. She was tried and found guilty of six charges, including a felony count of civil disorder. On March 23, 2023, Williams was sentenced to three years in prison with three years of probation and fined. &#91; 69 &#93; &#91; 70 &#93; &#91; 71 &#93; Christian Secor of Costa Mesa, California, was at the Capitol, where he allegedly flew the Groypers flag. He was convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding, civil disorder, assault, and resisting arrest, and sentenced to 42 months in prison. &#91; 72 &#93; Joseph Brody of Springfield, Virginia, and four others acted as a group that assisted the mob ""in using a metal barricade against a U.S. Capitol Police officer, knocking the officers back as he attempted to secure the North Door"". He was convicted of assaulting a police officer, resisting or impeding law enforcement officers, causing bodily injury, interfering with a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder, and obstruction of an official proceeding. &#91; 73 &#93; &#91; 74 &#93; &#91; 75 &#93; David Dempsey of Los Angeles, California, received a 20-year sentence for attacking several law enforcement officers on January 6. This was the second-longest sentence for any of those involved in the insurrection. Before sentencing, Dempsey apologized to the police officers in the courtroom, saying he had a ""profound sense of regret"", but as he was led out of the room after sentencing he made a hand sign associated with the Groyper movement. &#91; 76 &#93; Thomas Carey of Pittsburgh, Ohio, Gabriel Chase of Gainesville, Florida , Jon Lizak of Cold Spring Harbor, New York , and Paul Ewald Lovley of Halethorpe, Maryland , all pleaded guilty to demonstrating in a Capitol Building and were each fined $500. &#91; 77 &#93; &#91; 78 &#93; &#91; 73 &#93; Groyper influencer Anthime Gionet , known as Baked Alaska, was arrested for his role in storming the Capitol building, which he live streamed. According to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue , ""During the riot, he wore Pit Viper sunglasses , which have since been adopted as a symbol by the Groypers."" &#91; 79 &#93; &#91; 80 &#93; Tristan Sartor of Ruffs Dale, Pennsylvania , was charged with criminally entering a restricted building and attempting to ""impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business"" at the Capitol. &#91; 81 &#93; &#91; 82 &#93; Groyper War 2 (2024) In August 2024, Fuentes began a ""digital war"" against Trump's presidential campaign , which he dubbed ""Groyper War 2"", referencing his followers' activities in 2019. &#91; 83 &#93; In response to Trump's poor polling , Fuentes began calling on his followers to&#160;""bring the energy with memes, edits, replies, and trolls"" aimed at pressuring Trump's campaign to adopt further-right positions on race and immigration, as well as urging Trump to fire his campaign advisors Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles . &#91; 84 &#93; In addition to directing his followers to make their demands trend on X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social , Fuentes threatened to ""escalate pressure in the real world"", urging followers to withhold their votes and protest Trump rallies in battleground states. &#91; 83 &#93; A senior researcher for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue speculated that Fuentes's ""crude"" attempts at platform manipulation could be a blueprint for more sophisticated actors, such as hostile states , to engage in foreign election interference due to the lack of enforcement actions taken by Twitter and Truth Social in response to Fuentes's brief influence campaign. &#91; 85 &#93; &#91; 86 &#93; Shortly after initiating this effort, Fuentes took credit for Trump's rehiring of Corey Lewandowski as a senior campaign advisor. An anonymous source cited by The Washington Post claimed that Fuentes was making it ""far more difficult for Trump"" to make changes to his campaign ""if it looks like he's responding to the groypers"". &#91; 83 &#93; Political activism Disavowals and challenges The Groyper movement has repeatedly failed to gain political traction, often being disavowed by the politicians it has attempted to support. Congressman Paul Gosar , the keynote speaker at Fuentes's AFPAC II in 2021, disavowed Fuentes and his followers the next day while addressing CPAC . &#91; 87 &#93; At AFPAC III in 2022, several political figures whom Fuentes claimed were slated to speak, including Arizona gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and former acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan , did not attend and disavowed the event upon learning of Fuentes's views. &#91; 88 &#93; &#91; 89 &#93; The conference's keynote speaker, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene , later said she did not know who Fuentes was and, upon learning of his views, condemned him. &#91; 90 &#93; One of the candidates Fuentes endorsed in the 2022 midterms who later disavowed his endorsement was Joe Kent , who ran for the 3rd congressional district in Washington . &#91; 91 &#93; In response to Kent's disavowal, Fuentes began organizing an online campaign against him, but Kent won the Republican nomination and defeated incumbent Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler . &#91; 92 &#93; Electoral involvement Of the AFPAC III speakers who did not rescind their support for Fuentes, only two ran for major office: Lieutenant Governor of Idaho Janice McGeachin and Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers . Rogers won a competitive primary that year and was reelected, but she was censured for her remarks at the conference calling for political violence . &#91; 93 &#93; McGeachin, who ran for governor of Idaho that year, lost the primary to incumbent Governor Brad Little by a 20-point margin. Fuentes and the Groyper movement later supported Laura Loomer 's candidacy for Florida's 11th congressional district in 2022. &#91; 94 &#93; On the night of the primary, Fuentes attended Loomer's election watch party, and they were filmed sharing a toast as results came in that seemed to suggest Loomer would defeat incumbent Congressman Daniel Webster ; Loomer toasted ""to the hostile takeover of the Republican Party"". &#91; 95 &#93; When additional results came in confirming Loomer's loss to Webster by 7 points, she claimed without evidence in a speech to her supporters that her loss was due to voter fraud. &#91; 96 &#93; &#91; 97 &#93; Kanye West campaign In late 2022 and early 2023, the Groyper movement shifted away from its longtime position of supporting Trump and instead began promoting Kanye West 's presidential campaign . West brought Fuentes to a dinner at Mar-a-Lago with Trump, which generated significant controversy and raised Fuentes's profile; Trump later disavowed Fuentes, saying he was not initially aware of Fuentes's views. &#91; 98 &#93; &#91; 99 &#93; West's campaign soon included other figures in the Groyper movement, including Milo Yiannopoulos , &#91; 100 &#93; Ali Alexander , &#91; 101 &#93; and Rumble streamer Nico Kenn De Balinthazy , better known by his online alias ""Sneako"". &#91; 102 &#93; Many Groypers, including fellow streamers on Fuentes's website Cozy.tv, began using their platforms to promote West's antisemitic views. &#91; 103 &#93; Two Cozy streamers, Dalton Clodfelter and Tyler Russell, began streaming themselves harassing students at college campuses with a table display reading ""Ye is Right—Change my Mind"", a slogan that derived from a college tour by right-wing commentator Steven Crowder . &#91; 104 &#93; &#91; 105 &#93; Jewish student groups and allies frequently protested these events, playing music on loudspeakers and chanting in order to drown out the streamers' speeches. &#91; 106 &#93; The planned college tour was canceled after less than a month after Clodfelter lost the funding for both the tour and the Rumble channel associated with it. &#91; 107 &#93; On May 4, 2023, it was reported that West had fired Fuentes and Alexander, the latter of whom had become embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal involving young men and underage boys, and rehired Yiannopoulos, who had since split from Fuentes and was the first person to leak the allegations against Alexander. &#91; 108 &#93; &#91; 109 &#93; References ^ ""Trump hosts Kanye West, Nick Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago dinner"" .

Groypers represent the extreme right of US politics, the bleeding edge between fascist outsiders and the Christian nationalist faction attempting to ride Trump’s campaign into the heart of the GOP . They are overtly antisemitic, spreading threats against Jewish people and openly empathizing with Hitler. They are Christian and white nationalists, using imagery and language associated with the Crusades to describe their angry posts and their violence. They are also proudly misogynistic and anti- LGBTQ , reversing the pro-choice ‘my body, my choice’ slogan as ‘your body, my choice,’ underlining their opposition to abortion and their naked support for patriarchal domination. They’re mostly young, and there aren’t a lot of them. But they are loud, active, and intent on transforming US &nbsp;politics.” Continue reading&nbsp;here.

It has brought Nick Fuentes and his 'Groyper' movement back into the spotlight. Authorities are investigating the motive behind the attack. Online speculation links the suspect, Tyler Robinson, to Fuentes' group. Fuentes, a far-right leader, has denied any involvement. Nick Fuentes is a antisemite - far-right leader who has often praised Adolf Hitler The shooting of right-wing political conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has reignited attention on far-right figure Nick Fuentes . It has brought back the spotlight on a long-simmering feud within elements of the far right, particularly between Kirk and the so-called ""Groyper"" movement led by white nationalist Nick Fuentes. As authorities investigate the motive behind the assassination of President Trump's ally, online speculation has turned toward extremist factions that once targeted Kirk—specifically, Fuentes' "" Groyper Army ,"" which has long accused him of being insufficiently radical. Social media claims are now linking the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, to Fuentes' 'Groyper' movement.

Nick Fuentes is a antisemite - far-right leader who has often praised Adolf Hitler, according to Texas Tribune. A Holocaust denier, he had called for a ""holy war"" against Jews and compared the 6 million killed by the Nazis to cookies being baked in an oven, the outlet reported. He was born in the Chicago suburbs in 1998. Fuentes dropped out of college after the rally and ramped up his presence on YouTube, often coating his most extreme views in humor and satire. Fuentes’ followers have been nicknamed “groypers” after a cartoon frog that has become a meme in far-right online communities. 'Groypers' often accused Kirk of not being “pro-white” enough.

Mysterious book ‘The Shooting of Charlie Kirk’ surfaces online a day before tragedy “Groypers” would often try to access microphones during Q&A sessions in order to attack Kirk, who helped recruit younger voters to the GOP. He has fantasized about marrying a 16-year-old when he is older. During the 2019 ""Groyper Wars,"" Fuentes' supporters disrupted Turning Point USA events, challenging Kirk on immigration and LGBTQ rights while labeling him a ""gatekeeper"" of establishment conservatism, reports NewsWeek. What is Groyper Army? The Groyper Army is a far-right, internet-driven movement centered on white nationalist and “America First” figure Nick Fuentes. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes the group as composed of “alt-right, white nationalist, and Christian nationalist activists” who promote deeply antisemitic, racist, and homophobic beliefs, frequently disguising their extremism behind language focused on traditional values and family. Their mascot is a cartoon frog called ""Groyper,"" a variant of the ""Pepe"" meme used widely among extremist groups. The term ""Groyper"" gained momentum in 2019 during a public feud inside the conservative movement. That year, followers of Nick Fuentes disrupted college events hosted by Charlie Kirk and his group, Turning Point USA, accusing Kirk of watering down Donald Trump's message. Charlie Kirk responded by calling the Groypers extremists. ALSO READ: Why is Trump's face 'drooping' as latest photos of US President spark health rumours?
