## Chord Diagram
- I applied my new V2 JSON method [(keywords/exploratory_keywords_v2_plus.json)] to the [POTUS Presidential Actions Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhZPyUYXrsAF5z6kTfYSFieFw1R6JO1cmkVFakNu-uk/edit?usp=sharing)
    - multiple keywords now exist under overarching **themes**.
- Built a simple chord diagram visualisation [visualizations/chord_presidential_actions_hybrid_v3.html](https://github.com/mkm-cdnz/weird-guys/blob/main/visualizations/chord_presidential_actions_hybrid_v3.html)
    - Allows the user to navigate relationships between keywords, and the corresponding presidential action
    - Title
    - Publication Date
    - list of keywords
    - Snippet of keywords in context

## Static Gephy SVG
- Very large files are hard to view online, thus making [inline_svg_panzoom_touch_noselect.html](/visualizations/inline_svg_panzoom_touch_noselect.html) a portable SVG makes sense
